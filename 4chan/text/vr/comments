    castlevania 64 would be fondly remembered if symphony of the night literally didnt exist or was a bad game    how desperate are n64 fans i like these mental gymnastics ive got one castlevania 64 would be more fondly remembered if it was the only n64 game that existed
manchildren that picked the loser console or their parents picked it for them and 20 years later still cant let it go jesus christ people you can play both now you dont have to have your rivalries anymore
  pretending i didnt have both 20 years ago  sure feels good being an idort from childhood on
you played this game as a kid and it tingles the nostalgia bone when you replay it and it reminds you of a time when you were happy and had a whole life of possibilities ahead of you instead of being a dead end jaded faggot
1 guy is representative for all n64 fans  most actual n64 fanboys only fellate the nintendo 1st party titles and maybe rare they dont appreciate the third party stuff that is actually there as much  castlevania 64 wasnt the best konami offering on the system but it isnt as bad as most people meme it to be  that said i think it has nothing to do with sotn being popular or not in fact sotn was more appreciated later because in 1998 people wanted 3d  both sotn and cv64 cant hold a candle to the classicvanias anyways    the loser console is if you only own one of them like it or not n64 will always have the multiplayer element that makes it more sociable than any other console that gen doesnt seem like loser to me but whatever floats your console war boat
sotn fanboys have literally run a smear campaign for the last 20 years against cv64 simply because their game got ignored for being 2d    notice how many people reflexively refer to cv64 as critically panned despite the fact that it got good enough reviews back then to get a green rating on metacritic this is what repeated attempts at misinfo and historical revisionism looks like    these sotn maoists need a good old fashioned purging
both sotn and this shit arent castlevania games or even good games for that matter
  youre mentally ill op seek help
  because their game got ignored for being 2d    except it didnt and was almost universally regarded as one of the systems best titles from the moment it launched and graced the cover of many a gaming rag
  no it doesnt matter what the general public does  what matters is what a bunch of game journlolists do
    sotn sold over a million copies thats over twice as many as castlevania 64 and youre trying to pass it off as some kind of failure the desperation of n64 fangirls is unreal
  nah its like 08 m vs 12 m if you include legacy of darkness so sotn only sold a bit more on a console with 3x the userbase and lower game prices
20 year old console wars shitposting  do you niggers really have nothing better to do
  sotn sold over a million copies thats over twice as many as castlevania 64    citation needed    i have never seen anything on sales figures only capcom has released sales figures for old games
  i dont see whats wrong with what he said hes saying that castlevania 64 isnt as bad as people say it is if actually taken on its own and that most of the negative reaction to it is due to direct comparisons to symphony of the night
  i never had n64 in my life and castlevania 64 is really good outside of shitty camera especially legacy of darkness version  also symphony of the night is overrated as fuck circle of the moon and sorrow dilogy are much better games
castlevania 64 is ok it may not be as bad as i remember the public painting it back when it released but honestly i think its a bit overrated these days when the n64 kids come out to start defending it its a playable enough game but far from some unfairly maligned classic and easily one of my least favorite castlevania games
sotniggers are subhuman
  still a better game than 64
c64/lod is one of my top 5 games of all time the controls and camera never bothered me and i honestly dont get all the fuss i loved the atmosphere the characters the story and the music and i occasionally replay lod every few years or so i just adore it i will never understand the hate for it i really think its just a bandwagon thing i also loved sotn and have played through it multiple times as recently as last year but c64/lod is still my favorite no other castlevania has ever stayed with me for as long
  he said more fondly you retarded faggot you bitch about mental gymnastics and then put words in the guys mouth to justify your dipshit thread
  speaking personally its not a bandwagon thing i played it as a child when it first released before i ever touched sotn and hated how the platforming and combat felt i didnt make it very far  i beat the game for the first time earlier this year it wasnt terrible but i wasnt impressed the platforming and combat still didnt feel very good platforming especially was stiff and at times unreliable attacking things isnt very satisfying even for its time animations were lacking and in general its design isnt exactly inspiring most areas are really simple and kind of small they dont really show off what the n64 was capable of and theyre just kind of underwhelming to explore puzzle design was way too simple as well but i did like some of the time sensitive stuff figuring out to stand on the fountain platform at midnight made me feel like indiana jones   excluding the bull and the final bosses most of the boss fights lacked any meaningful strategy or pattern recognition  the plot i didnt care about at all the twist felt like it was just ther to be there and the presentation made most of the plot hard to care about just feels like the n64 was unequipped to deal with the sort of storytelling this game was aiming for and at worst it feels like an afterthought most of it just didnt matter to me at all  plus the game is ugly
    nintendo fanboys are on a tier of their own
  i want you to suffer     you too
    go ahead and buy another re release of super mario bros for the 10th time you fucking manchild
honestly pretty decent games    i didnt play them till i was older and ordered myself copies online for xmas one year
  i want you to suffer  not an argument sorry your favorite game isnt very good
  literally dark souls before dark souls
is there any reason to play c64 before lod other than curiosity
  c64 had voice acting it wasnt half bad lod dropped itpresumably to free up space for more levels and playable characters c64 also had some easter eggs that lod dropped like alternate costumes for reinhardt and carrie that were throwbacks to classic cv protags
i prefer cv64 to sotn as jank as the gameplay and camera can get at least its designed like a proper castlevania game not metroid for babbies  now with jarpig gimmicks like stats and spells
    if this didnt scare the shit out of you when it happened for the first time you are lying
  the fact that it was on the greatest hits green label edition perhaps
  actually made me think i was on /v/
  its designed like a proper castlevania game  the absolute state of nintendownies
  proportionally speaking the 64 games sold more than the ps1 games sotn is overrated and only talked about to this day because it came out on a sony console if it had come out on the saturn it would just be a forgotten gem hence why you should never listen to what sony ponies tell you they have zero standards as proven by the garbage pseudogames they shill now
  proportionally speaking  the cope is real
  making a post saying the console war doesnt matter anyway while simultaneously being a console warrior
  like it or not n64 castlevania has actual platforming a whip guy as the protagonist and linear actiony level design outside of a couple adventure stages such as castle center sotn really shouldnt even be called castlevania since it was such a radical departure for the franchise which ultimately ruined it due to killing off the tride and true classicvania formula and endlessly rehashing sotn instead
  castlevania 64 is a few things proper castlevania isnt one of them you may have a hate boner for sotn and thats fine but it doesnt make castlevania 64 any better its still a middling ugly product of its time more than it is a proper castlevania title
  how is he being a console warrior if hes telling you to play both
  agreed      agreed
    cv64 is a konami game nintendo had nothing to do with it  but its on a nintendo system  stop being poor
  implying half the people in this thread bitching about c64 have ever even actually played it  lol
  i owned a ps1 and n64 back when they were still getting new releases the only reason anyone defends this game these days is because they were a faggy 64only kid stop being retarded
  just because you say you did doesnt make it true  also nah n64 fanboys dont care about konami stuff only nintendo and rare
  just because you say you did doesnt make it true  well too bad faggot because it is true
  ill choose not to believe you anyway youre still wrong about n64only fags caring about this game
  ill choose not to believe you  you have a right to be wrong  youre still wrong about n64only fags caring about this game  it sure as shit isnt the playstationonly fags anyone who had both knew they had better castlevania options available on sonys platform it was no secret
  false game
  i played it for the first time a few years ago after finding it cheap at a flea market and i enjoyed the fuck out of it get fucked faggot
  it sure as shit isnt the playstationonly fags  of course not im not saying that  sotn isnt even a real castlevania either and chronicles is a casualized version of a 1993 game released very late when the ps2 was already out
fifth gen babbies arguing over which piece of shit is less stinky  top  kek
  sotn isnt even a real castlevania either  sure but its still a better game than 64
  wrong
  he likes the shittiest 4th gen one most
  opinion  wrong  lol
  i do like sotn a bit more but cv64 has its strong points for instance it actually manages to get tense in a lot of moments in that sense it feels more like castlevania than the walk in the park that is sotn
  but he didnt post a picture of super castlevania bros
  australia kun shitposted against a single game for years  thats dedication
  super castlevania bros  shit meme you have there friend
  literally who
  it actually manages to get tense in a lot of moments in that sense it feels more like castlevania than the walk in the park that is sotn  thats a fair enough point but i think its mostly for the wrong reasons i only felt like the game got tense thanks to its unreliable platforming seems like 10 of the time rob schneider would just refuse to grab a ledge despite the fact that i was firmly holding the a button and rubbing his face against a ledge it is a fairly more difficult game than sotn though although most games are and i dont think that greatly diminishes the quality of sotn my favorites in the series are rondo and dracula x rondo for its design that feels like a logical place for classicvania to go and dracula x for its difficulty and visuals rightfully i think of the metroidvanias as a completely separate genre castlevania in name but something else entirely i think comparing those to classicvania is a useless effort i get that people dont like those games and wish the series didnt take that direction but making a big stink out of it seems retarded when it comes to 64 the game just feels like a completely average at best attempt to adapt classicvania to 3d not good not bad just kind of existing but it doesnt nearly reach the highs that the best classicvanias or metroidvania games do
i like the game its pretty atmospheric and challenging even if it feels a bit clunky at times  just like classicvanias  i never got the appeal of sotn i think games like portrait of ruin or aria of sorrow are way better than that game
  i think that was just for games that shipped either 150 or 250k units i forgot which sotn no doubt sold hundreds of thousands of copies
i didnt like it that much symphony of the night was kind of boring too but it was much more developed aesthetically it looks great 2d sprites at its peak
  asslevania or assholevania if you will 64 is fucking bad just fucking bad bad bad baddoesnt matter that there was a better game on ps1 its just a fucking bad game    both sotn and cv64 cant hold a candle to the classicvanias anyways  this but unironically    sotn is a good game its just not a good castlevania game if it was its own separate franchise and considered more of a metroidlike but in a different time period / with different weapons and enemies and shit that would be fineits definitely not a castlevania game    sotniggers really are a blemish on the fanbase but cv64channers are even worse
  no thats kings field
    desu senpai  rondo  bloodlines  super cv4  dracula x  but theyre all 9/10 games or higher
  sotn fanboys have literally run a smear campaign for the last 20 years against cv64  mental illness you are not well
  rondo  sciv  dracula x  bloodlines
  bloodlines is the worst 16bit vania   theyre all 9/10 games or higher  not even close the series at its best is barely higher than an 8
  objectivity correct ranking
  id say rondo is a 9 would have been close to perfection if difficulty were higher especially dracula  otherwise yeah everything else doesnt go past an 8
  not true i owned an n64 and a ps played c64 and sotn when they were new still legitimately love c64 though sotn is indeed a great game shove your shit back up your ass
  vampires kiss last  no x68000  fucking brainlets
  shove your shit back up your ass  thats gross you should apologize  i accept in advance
why is arcade castlevania so bad
  this anyone who says crap like cameras are bad in old 3d game are legit fucking dyslexic retards their opinions dont mean shit i love c64 its the only game besides the nes ones that capture the casltevania feel and theme and doesnt resort to being anime shit    
  this anyone who says crap like cameras are bad in old 3d game are legit fucking dyslexic retards  why are you screaming at nobody anon
  he hasnt gotten his pills
  not even close the series at its best is barely higher than an 8  thread keeps getting worse
best thing to come from the 64 games
  fuck outta here with this trash    its the only game besides the nes ones that capture the casltevania feel and theme and doesnt resort to being anime shit  you hit the nail on the head
i actually really enjoy castlevania 64 sure sotn is better but c64 still has a lot going for it a fully 3d explorable castle wouldnt be done again until lords of shadow and that was more of a gow clone than a castlevania game multiple protagonists and different stories really set 64 apart i love how you feel a true sense of progress by slowly infiltrating deeper and deeper into the castle you start out in the woods for a full level then only make it into the castle walls and have to pass through some underground caverns before you make it into the castle proper the only part i hated was that segment where you have to carry the nitro around
  a fully 3d explorable castle wouldnt be done again until lords of shadow  lament of innocence didnt have that
  tdyslexic retard
  nintenbabby trash    game of the year
  the alternate reality where you live must be awful
  i can use critical acclaim to bolster my argument but you cant
  nice victim complex
  castlevania 64 got good reviews though legacy of darkness is a better game that confused reviewers because reselling a fixed version of the same game a year later wasnt the norm yet
  sotn got endlessly rehashed because it was actually good
i wouldnt dare suggest cv64 is better than sotn i would suggest however that it actually a pretty good game outside of the camera i still play this game from time to time i shill it in cv threads too and legacy of darkness
its not that bad not the best game but not that bad
  nah it was because its casual game design appealed to a wider audience than arcadestyle castlevania which take a bit more skill to actually beat if you prefer sotn thats cool and all but it just means youre an inferior degenerate jarpig who helped kill real castlevania
  cv64 wasnt real cv either
where does that video come from youtube i hope it isnt some e celeb crap
  this elitism  castlevania wasnt exactly a niche series before sotn nigra stop
  nope they were always for games that sold 1 million copies once xenogears finally hit that mark in 2003 it got released under the greatest hits label
ddr is still kickin does anyone here still play
  i was at a convention with my three fwb a few weeks ago and we played my metal pads are beat to all hell now though
we have one at the arcade around here and my friend has a couple of titles that she drags out to kick my ass in when i go to visit
dancing to cringey jpop is totally gay
  what if i told you that not all songs on ddr are jpop
  what if i told you still look gay as fuck on these machines and god forbid if youre over 18 you look absolutely pathetic
  what if i told you still look gay as fuck on these machines     this board is 18 son
  stop being outgoing and having fun  stop projecting
  judging from this thread i could almost swear i walked on to an autistic kindergarten
  youre just embarrassing yourself with weeabo shit dont try to act like youre a normal well adjusted person
yeah they have a general for it over on /jp/
ddr is fun as shit used to think it was really weird and silly til i tried it
im gonna break my rusty cage
  and ruuuuuuuuuunnn
was it better on ps saturn or 3do
  pc for everything but audio saturn for framerate 3do for looking slightly nicer than saturn psx for if its your only option
  heeeeere we are passing around the stories all the things they taught us well yeah they taught us well now
  this game taught me how to drink
burnout owes so fucking much to 3do road rash and road rash 3d the crash cams the licensed buttrock the general idea of making your opponents crash rather than just being faster than them and the open race structure in rr3d and burnout paradise the spiritual sequel road redemption is really fucking fun in multiplayer just like every road rash game but it just misses something that the originals had
too soon
mean machine mean machine
  fun anecdote  i actually bought the hammerbox cassette from the catalogue that came with the game i got it like 3 months later or something like that i dont know what the hell i received looking at it now it was supposed to be numb i guess but it felt like they sent me some random shit that totally sucked ass maybe it was the first cd instead i dont remember
    130  jessie youre a good doggo  please dont follow me  just go on home
i started playing rr64 last night and its pretty damn fun does this series have any bad games
  does the pc version still have the awesome soundtrack    i tried playing it on a psx emulator but some of the menu graphics were fucked up though the game was still fun as hell
  that song is a bitch to play on rock band
  road rash 95 still has the licensed menu music midi race music music videos and all fmvs its actually the definitive version of the game because it has a bike hud network multiplayer more control mappings audio mixer sliders unless someone here wants to prove otherwise
  cant argue with that but i just play the saturn version now since its easier to boot no clicking required my pc has to  mount image every time  change desktop resolution to 43 so it doesnt stretch  disable windows explorer so the colors arent messed up  its worth it to see better graphics and 60fps but the low res sprites on console rr are still fine possibly more aesthetic even
best post race scene  
  haha holy shit id forgotten these fucking videos they were something else up there with the red alert 1/2 videos
anyone else having problems saving in the pc version
  emulating or off disc  what os or using dosbox
    i loves me some early openworld 3d especially before all this modern experiencepoints got added
  road remeption is a game where you fight on bikes where the original road rash games are fairly serious racing games where you can also punch
  one i got from abandonware

teen agent free off gog  fable 1996
spideeeeer wuuuuuuuuuussssss come out and plaaaaaaaaaaaaayy
tag
is this sm 1 or 2 is the dreamcast version of sm1 the best version
chickenwuss come out to play
  its sm1    is the dreamcast version of sm1 the best version    supposedly although i havent delved much into it ports on better consoles dont always make for better ports see soul reaver framerate and resolution are obviously going to be better but the ps1 version is still great for what it is
  soul reaver on dc is the best version though unless you happen to prefer the ps1/pc textures and lower poly models
this game had the best venom and the best carnage  sssssstop maake it stopppppppp
  playstation is the best version neversoft ftw
  depends does the dc version have the what if mode
  soul reaver on dc is the best version though    debatable there are missing effects lighting and textures and the color palette appears more dull not as dull as the pc version but less warm than ps1 plus the higher poly models arent all that great and hinder the art direction imo
    dc/pc is the only version actually looks like black cat actually looks like black cat and not some grandmas face
  not sure all i know is that the pc version has some development issues and a guy named matt apparently needed to be fired  
 and the best soundtrack                          i could go on
rrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh
  venom and carnage for ps1 are the best versions though i like how goofy but nonetheless scary they are it suits their vas better though i dont remember if the dreamcast had the same models but im certain that at least the pc one had the more menacing and comiclike ones
  is that brood or symbiotes on the cover
  why the fuck did i listen to all of that
  one who didnt play the game would rightly suppose theyre brood because they look somewhat similar but according to the main enemies youll encounter on that chapter i think its safe to assume theyre symbiotes
  because its very compelling
  i hate what they did to seifer
  pc has the classic engine assumes a specific frame rate but actually runs at another issue  stick to dc or ps1
  there are missing effects lighting and textures and the color palette appears more dull not as dull as the pc version but less warm than ps1  wrong the textures just look a little more compressed on dreamcast vs pc but theyll still look better than the pixelated shit you see on ps1
  best soundtrack  oh sweetie   
  say what you will about the sega cd and turbografx cd but you cant shit on cdaudio vs all the other shit out at the time  that said this track is extreme lulz
  no mysterio fire matt  he deserved it
fuck off venom im trying to relax
  i remember the one you posted its damn good but you still cant really compare it to the astonishing work neversoft used to pull out with their soundtracks in fact there isnt even a single ugly or out of place track on spiderman 2000 imho theyre all great and asskicking
what a great game it was the writing was on point the humor was very good even the plot was good not to mention stan lees narration
  ports on better consoles dont always make for better ports see soul reaver  bruh you trying to talk shit about dreamcast soul reaver
what game had the best running animation
pacman 2
  prince of persia
  i dont know but kirbys got the best dance animation
  or the lion king but honestly it doesnt seem fair to compare stuff drawn by disney animators to videogame animators
  it doesnt seem fair to compare stuff drawn by disney animators to videogame animators  you give disney far too much fucking credit for the amount of absolute fucking garbage theyve vomited up over the decades retards in care facilities are able to draw better original looking characters than the hacks at disney
  if you mention any other run animation that isnt prince of persia then youre dead wrong
  how can one man be so wrong
  your glaring autism is showing go take your meds and dont come back
treasure master
  stay mad walt disney your animation is shittier
  do you legitimately dislike the quality of disney animations or is your hatred due to something about devilworshipping jewish pedophile conspiracies

  dancing like a lame 13 year old in the corner at a middle school dance  kirby is a better dancer than sakura
  my new headcanon is that he only entered draculas castle to find a bathroom and visited each room hoping there would be a chamber pot but he kept getting harassed by monsters
  conspiracies  youre probably too stupid to realize this but conspiracies literally can be true by definition
  can be true  and your point
  this
  youd think eventually hed just pick up a skull and have at it
  look at the way he dresses simon belmont is a man of dignity a constipated patrician on a mission    dracula cant keep his secret private bathroom hidden forever
  looks and walks like joseph stalin
  a constipated patrician on a mission
  agreed but flashback was pretty good
  thats beautiful actually not in a furry way haha
portrait of ruin was the first castlevania i ever picked up and played through to the end its not exactly retro but i liked the animations and interchangeable play style    theres a slight jerk in the right foot picking up probably where it loops but its otherwise pretty cosy to watch
  conspiracies  every (((time)))
  
  came in here to post this alternatively i dont know what they why the felt jim would do a standing jog for his idle animation but ive always loved it

  ive always thought this run cycle was too sexual i dont know why
how has nobody posted this yet
  but the body is mechanical
  love this game always hated that walk cycle reminds me of that laughably bad effect on superman when clark is racing the train      now thats a fkn walk cycle
    because it looks like shit
first best right here
  there are a lot of things sotn does well alucards walk cycle is not one of them
  xd posting this to reddit
  i can hear this gif
how is this even a question
  alucards walk has always looked strange to me its like hes doing a michael jackson moonwalk except still moving forward
  i cant gif but moon crystal for famicom has some great animation 
  the rotoscoping is cool but the poses are pretty weak its like hes doing a wussified jog rather than a powerful run       very impressive bateman but check this out
the most commanding walk cycle
  for me its the stern determination of mmxs running animation the nes counterpart is a classic no doubt about it but his blank expression is a bit too npc for my liking      its the fist movements or the fact that hes clearly feeling like hes wearing nothing at all
  most kino anon
  same here
  yeah xs running animation is the best have to agree
  yep this is the best walking/running cycle of all time
  thats a bit exaggerated dont you think    id prefer pic related
  mustfindtheshitter  mustfindtheshitter
lets have a thread about retro evangelion games given that best girls birthday is in a few days
games  as far as retro goes the n64 game is literally the only one
  literally the only one    wut
  game
  to be fair ikari raising project is a simulation not a novel
  vns are games get over it
  theres a couple rpgs for the saturn that arent translated
  picture books are games  get over it    whatever you say weeb
  hey you can choose 3 different outcomes at the end  the game even has some challenge getting lost in nerv hq or neo tokyo streets
  i have the second one of those its really well made they even digitized the intro from the show well its a cool release
    how is the actual gameplay of the saturn games 1st impression and 2nd impression right or is there more  i only have the digital card collection on saturn which is comprised of 10 or so minigames and the objective is completing a folder of trading cards that actually hold a short fmv each it also has the full opening and ending on fmv
  welll ive only played second impression but the main gameplay is basic decision trees but its very stylized and has lots of animation and voice acting but its intercut with the occasional eva segment which are kind of like real time rpg battles where you aim a reticle each attack maybe a little like a watered down paper mario though this is a stretched comparisson     they are actually really well rendered maybe not quite the 64 games level but quite nice
  pretty sure this is the only decent eva game
i feel like an eva game would be possible  like as a sort of boss rush game every angel is this super powerful difficult boss that takes a long time to beat and has no checkpoints  think cuphead but its a 3d mech action game  the cutscenes could just be the entire anime  and in the final part you could explore instrumentality in an lsd dream emulator sort of fashion
  asuka has a cute little butt
  ive always thought a tower defense kinda game sorta like what youre describing would be great like phase 1 design the layout for tokyo 3 and decide where to put weapons battery chargers etc but theres a strict budget you need to adhear to that they keep cutting     then the angel bossfight comes but i imagine it being sorta roguelike in the sense they come in a psuedorandom order and sometimes you get brand new angels angels from spinoffs etc    eva repairs between levels also eat up your budget and pilots may have unhealed injuries that makes them worse at piloting and pilots can die emotional states can make evas harder to control properly    multiplayer would just be different players controlling different evas who would be ai otherwise though a player could also take a command center position and use buildings cannons etc to distract angels or help in other ways     evas would be hard as fuck to control and anyone playing for the first time should just be flopping around helplessly     thats my gay idea for a videogame
  nah i hate those realistic sim elements
  this is the best gameplay style i think ive seen for an eva game it looks like it could work out really well as a fairly detailed strategy game  from what i can tell the daytoday gameplay has you raising and lowering various stats and affinities with different characters via your actions they tie it into the idea of synch ratios and at field strengths being related to mental strength quite well and eva really lends itself to lots of nice little alternatives that can have longreaching effects for example in the n64 game its possible to not faceplant after beating israfel in this game its possible to peacefully talk kaworu into giving up things like this are what i want from an eva game because branching extras compared to the canon make me smile like an idiot
i just bought 4 eva saturn games in a bundle for a good price iron maiden/steel girlfriend and 2nd impression ive know about for years but ill also be getting a mah jong title too      collecting japanese saturn and ps1 games is still pretty competitive good value to be found
  thats my gay idea for a videogame  better than what they put out
does season of the sakura count i also recall a strip poker of mahjong game
  pr0n  of course it freaking counts
ive always wanted to play one of the psp games that had the exclusive info and the dating sim aspect or whatever but it probably wouldnt live up to the hype after all this time
  say what you want but girlfriend of steel is top comfy  evangelion 64 is likely the better one though its like evangelion the vidya for real
  i really like girlfriend of steel the 64 game was very impressive but didnt really have much substance i would argue steel is much better because it a full narrative experience
  in reality girlfriend of steel doesnt really have that much substance as a game either even for a vn the amount of player input was the really bare minimum however the presentation is very high quality actual artists from the tv series helped if you see the sequel girlfriend of steel 2 you can notice that it has a more amateurish art style and isnt really on point with the tv series  i think the same happens with evangelion 64 the presentation is high quality they nailed the designs of the evas angels and everything else and somehow made it into a late n64 cart but the gameplay is mostly a collection of minigames and weird 1 vs 1 battle missions that kind of make sense when you get used to it but at the end of the day its mostly based on pre determined commands and button mash  its still the most eva the video game one though like you actually take control of the eva in real time and beat the angels in a semirealistic way not rpg or smash broslike
isnt girlfriend of steel cannon
  not really but it could fit in the series narrative somewhere between 9th and 13rd angels during the action arc
had no idea the n64 had an evangelionan game neato
mana best girl    doesnt really tie into the series that much but the pspgame has some ingamewikistuff which adds tons of stuff to the canon like first ancestral race etc
  the classified information stuff was interesting but a lot of it wasnt really revealed for the first time there for example the far were mentioned for the first time in the project eva dossier/proposal text by gainax in 1993 they were never mentioned in the series or movies though  same with a lot of other stuff from the ci that was also mentioned in the red cross book but i do believe some stuff was kind of clarified on the ci plus not many people were aware of the 1993 dossier  mana is indeed best girl
super robot wars f had evangelions debut in the series  and considering the other retro srw games we also have f final and alpha
what are some fun games you can finish in an hour or two
outrun is a good quickie
omega boost
  hoshi no kalby games
  most standard gameboy games the earlier titles in particular usually run about 30 minutes to complete
  star fox 64 super mario bros mega man x to be fair they take you longer til you get good it took me days to 100 mmx the first time i average about 50 minutes a playthrough if i follow the optimal order smb is a really short game all things considered if youre good youll fly through and if youre not youll die a lot star fox is pretty easy to easy to just pick up though the time consuming parts are the last 2 levels and trying to figure out the alternate pathswhich you wont even care about til you play a couple times those are my go to games when i just want to blow through a game
  already played this one super fun though
  this goddamn is this comfy  you can do most mega mans in that amount of time 1 2 and 3 are dope  panic restaurant too
felony 1179    i bought this game back in 98 and finished it in about an hour i was not amused
  the contra games after you master them
  gameboy ninja gaiden
tetris
  racing arcade racers like daytona or ridge racer   fps blue shift  platformer sonic 2 or 3  shooter parodius  i dunno some suggestions
umihara kawase
  after you master them  just put in the konami code and have some fun
  gb ninja gaiden  too easy
salamander 1  2
the majority of classic 2d action games can be beaten in that time if you have them down getting to that point is half the fun if you take breaks and enjoy the ride try something like alien soldier if you get the chance
thanks for all the recommendations guys
sonic 1 and 2 are about an hour    s3k and mania are about three hours each if you have an afternoon to kill
  i want to tack kirbys pinball onto this at first it seems very lacking but the more you play the better it gets the game is actually damn fine
  damn i remember that port at least it was easier to get the hadoken
  bullshit i guarantee not one of you has beat game b unless youre a savestating fucking cheater
kabuki  quantum fighter for nes ive beaten it 4 times on a gba sp  supercardcf it emulates nes when i had to be outside iirc its an hour not longer also killer ost
  ridge racer 1  time crisis 1 2  soulblade
which game was better
  mother 3
  not retrofblrubgl
  its a remake of earthbound 64
i like the improvements brought into mother 2 like seeing enemies on the map sneaking behind them the rolling hp meter the visual drug backgrounds the variety in locations and boss fights as well  however i think the plot on mother 1 is more meaningful and while i like 2s variety i think 1 pitches atmosphere better   same with the music mother 2 has a lot of variety and great experimental music using a lot of samplin techniques to produce trippy music that goes along well with the background graphics during battles or the colorful towns and bizarre locations like moonside  mother 1 is less trippy and more down to earth and despite being older graphics i think it feels more at home than mother 2 its also scarier when it needs to be despite mother 2 being more over the top at times it never had the same oimnous eerie vibe mother 1 can do
  same with the music mother 2 has a lot of variety and great experimental music using a lot of samplin techniques to produce trippy music that goes along well with the background graphics during battles or the colorful towns and bizarre locations like moonside  mean to add that while mother 1 has less amount of music and no sampling technique it still created some of the most memorable tunes in the franchise mother 2s music is more about the sound the different textures and weird effects mother 1 is more melodydriven  not to say 2 doesnt have great melodybased songs like all the towns tracks but imo none of them is as memorable as pollyanna or bein friends  the lullaby version of polyanna that plays on ness house is pretty cute though
  mother is much better m2 is basically a reboot
  kinda but not really it has a loose continuation same with mother 3
  penis
whichever one has the most chad protagonist
  mother 2 is much better just because it essentially is super mother 1
  ninten has asthma but ness gets homesick  id say ninten is the chaddest one  lucas is the chaddest one because hes the most powerful psi user secretly and gets to sleep around with an older girl
i like both but i like the first one better second one is still quite fun though    the only problem i have with both is that there isnt enough battle themes probably just the limited hardware though
  shit chapters and tedious shit in them  useless party members  small world and very linear  only feels like a mother game on chapter 4 start / when youre on the highway and newpork city  game depends on nostalgia for mother 2  haha no
  not him but why does it have to feel like a mother game and what does that mean having a modern city set up  depends on nostalgia  it literally kind of makes fun of nostalgia or exaggerates it to the point that the main antagonist is a nostalfag himself  also mother 2 has a lot of references to mother 1 as well
so many to choose from but i think the greatest love of them all is mother 1 however i like some music from mother 2
  i like 1 more ive played through it several times and it always feels fresh and fun to me but eb i think relies pretty heavily on its wacky value that is the first time you see everything in it its like wow crazy haha but seeing it again already knowing whats coming you lose a lot of that factor its still a great game though
  you couldnt be more wrong lucasfag lucas is the most virgin of them all  cant save mom  didnt stop his bro   its disliked by most people and takes shit from them  gets psi from a tranny  sleeps with an older girl citation needed  wont attack his bro even if the world literally depends on it  needs help from dad and a literal ghosts to win   only mc without teleport    yeah no ninten and ness are really much more chaddest and ness can get out of the homesick if you dont call mom but still ninten is the chaddest  ness  only mc to have a magicant all about him and reach enlightment  canonically brave  kind enough to be friends for some time with pos like porky  doesnt let his dog waste a party member slot  family complete and happy  respected by a gang leader and taking down said gang by himself  pure gf   still needs external help during the final battle  now ninten is the chaddest  can solo most of his adventure and final boss with the occasional help from a nerd because he is too chad for tech shit  doesnt need harmful psi in battle can teleport right on it too  can beat up the final boss if needed but singing is faster  has two pure girl after his dick and two sisters  loved by everyone on magicant  had his own super robot  gf is optional doesnt need a thot following him around  can climb up mtitoi as many times he wants doesnt get stuck in the final area  only has useful party members on his team
  gets to sleep around with an older girl  implying that little wiener could ever have the balls to do it with someone as brash as the bear tiger
      i swear to god im going to turn this thread around and then nobody is getting dairy queen if you children dont behave yourselves
  why does it have to feel like a mother game and what does that mean   since the last two games had a present/modern it would have been only natural to this one to have it imagine if dq suddenly had some sci fi shit instead of medieval its more about tradition than nostalgia since some of those games are stand alone yet they dont fuck up the basic whats the point of the dq clone on modern time if its going to have some generic fantasy setting  exaggerates it to the point that the main antagonist is a nostalfag himself  how porky seems more obsessed with ness and fucking with people  mother 2 has a lot of references to mother 1   giygas and 
  its more about tradition than nostalgia  yet you complain that mother 3 relies on nostalgia  there is nothing wrong with having a different concept or scenario besides mother 3 also has the modernized city and new pork city  how porky seems more obsessed with ness and fucking with people  exactly i mean porky has literally a nostalgia corridor with elements of both mother 1 and 2 and has the 16 melodies song  the fact hes obsessed with ness to the point of having his posessions framed and has a movie theatre displaying mother 2 id say its pretty clear  giygas and   there are quite a number of references to mother 1 in 2 the starmen the flying birds lots of music cues  mother 3 also has its share of references for example the seashell houses of the magypsies resemble the houses on m1s magicant and the seashell poles  some enemies also only appear in mother 1 and 3 like the titani  all 3 games are connected and are full of references of callbacks even if in weird ways
  yet you complain that mother 3 relies on nostalgia  youre confusing nostalgia with tradition  a game with noatalgia and no tradition would be like if mother was in fucking medieval era the whole time but you got lots of reference and a main villian from the past and ness joining your party because he also traveling trough time and shit thats nostalgia and zero tradition  now tradition and no nostalgia would be the same setting but nothing of mother 2 or 1 is ever mentioned  nostalgia corridor  thats more of the developers giving a curtain call because this is the last game and it was aimed at players that just finished 12 rmember 16 song being all about the three games but dont remember it being linked to porky in any way  references  yes some those are but not really big stuff like a major villian gigyas looks nothing like he did nor you have to play mother 1 in any way to get him and the past protagonists recurring enemies dont really feel like references you also think the bellsprout from pokemon gold are reference to pokemon red  either the references at the end game where more from the developers to the players than porky obsessing over earthbound like the mother 1 corridor porky clearly had nothing to do with that
  porky actually adresses ness as his best friend though
  based
  with a worse setting and writing
tfw you lose the mentality of ninten being a ness clone to realizing its ness who is the ripoff
  more like demake
  what the hell happened to duke nukems body proportions
  shrinker obviously havent you played duke 3d
  gets psi from a tranny    cross dressers and drag queens are not really transsexuals
  arent magypsies hermaphrodites though/
  citation needed
  arent they described as being neither men or women
  thatd be the opposide of hermaphoride then theyre both  magypsies are supernatural beings although obviously its intended to be a reference to transexuals i believe itoi said he has friends that are like that but instead of focusing on the sexuality or the gender thing he emphasizes on the fact theyre different than normal people but can be interesting too  then again the whole transgender culture in japan and asia is different than in the west  but yeah as far as the magypsies themselves theyre like fairies or angels which are also said to be neither men or women but have aspects of both  i like how they treat humans as kind of lesser things
  implying its any better
  love me some motherinspired chiptunes
  magypsies are supernatural beings although obviously its intended to be a reference to transexuals  wtf i hate mother now
  it is a matter of difference not quality
  321
  i think they are both great games but i figure mother 2 is going to have to get first prize mostly because the graphics added that much more charm to the world of the mother series cant go wrong with either title though
  get that crap outta here
  blow it out your ass
    come get some
  i ought to break a broom handle off in your ass
damn those alien bastards are gonna pay for shooting up my ride
is ness more american than duke nukem duke is pretty american but ness eats hamburgers hes gotten out of trash cans    thats pretty fucking american
mother 1 plays like shit
  can walk in 8 directions  screen scrolls properly  menues are fast and work fine  what about it plays like shit
  probably inventory but that goes for all of them
i can see mother 2 as being the better game but i cant bring myself to beat it i feel its too slow compared to the first game that i have beaten three times already on my computer and my phone
  at what point do you usually give up earthbound
  mother 1 definitely gets a bonus for not having as much useless plot shit you need to carry around
mother 2 is pretty much a direct improvement to every single aspect of the first game
  if thats true why do i enjoy mother 1 more
  not really mother 1 is more open world and more importantly has mothefucking pollyanna
          mothers ost is so fucking good
  the sanctuary guardian theme in earthbound always really stuck out for me its such a melancholy song for big boss battles
    this is entirely my opinion as well 2 is a great game maybe even a better game but i like 1 more
  thisits like mm and oot oot is definitely the better game but if you ask me which one to play i wouls absolutely choose mm
  i like mm and oot equally and treat them like theyre basically a package deal cant play one without the other
  ness and duke would get along
mother 1 best game  ana best girl
  wrong
  used goods
  ninten used ana dont kid yourself
  and here we go
  this
2 is better in every way    played them both for the first time this year i even started with mother kinda played it for the context/experience i had a decent time with the first game but i cant see myself playing it again
i like mother 1 more because its less linear and has a better resolution to the story
  finally fanart of the sailor that throws his slippers at the kraken what a time to be alive
  here have this
  bad post
  kraken battle theme is the best battle theme in earthbound prove me wrong    ness canonically fights fucking krakens alone wearing only his hat in the japanese version of the game  even if its only in magicant thats pretty fucking hardcore is ness the strongest retro nintendo protagonist
  is ness the strongest retro nintendo protagonist  hiii
  blocks your path
  social justice propaganda the game  better
  kirby didnt really become infinitely powerful until the more modern ones endgame ness could probably take him
  deltarune is better
ultimate got rid of trophies which means we cant view the new models for paulas panties and poo  mother 1 characters will never get 3d models  ninten didnt get in as a echo or semiclone  porky is probably back as a boss in his shitty mother 3 design  instead everyone gets a fucking soulinfused sticker  what a fucking trainwreck for mother representation in the biggest smash yet
  paula has a new model though
  2 is better in every way unless youre a contrarian
      kirby is broken and shit but we still have to remember he can die by apples and shit only got powerful recently because sakurai but i would say he is more of a fast glass canon
  2 is better in every way unless youve actually played both games  ftfy
  paula poo kumatora and boney got models for ness and lucass final smashes all of the mother stages are back too along with some new remixes and a new victory theme for ness and lucas plus the ramblin mushroom is a item now sakurai has some clear bias towards the mother series and i dont mind in the slightest feel sorry for fzerofags though      yeah and even though a lot of kirby final bosses are strong none of them compare to giygas
    i know they have new models  but the fact we only have to view em through gameplay only what sucks the most    feel sorry for fzerofags though  same at best they couldve gotten goroh black shadow and deathborne as characters but at least big blue is back and got kick ass remixes from sega remnants of amusement vision
  can someone edit that to say the war against the gays
  grindy shit with a poor translation  mt itoi      tell me how its better again please
  you are going have to explain this one
  he meant communism
  the same goes for me earthbound is objectively a better made but mother 1 was a more memorable experience    also how the fuck did they manage to fint that world map in a nes cartridge
   shit with a poor translation   itoi  this meme argument again now i really do know youve never played 1
  not gitting good at mt itoi  not one shotting nigs with pk beam y and pk freeze y
    pussies i did my first playtrough with only ninten and lloyd
  you read those posts backwards retard
  analess gameplay  is it really possible
  yes you only need lloyd to progress some roadblocks
  shes completely optional
i liked the mother 1 doujinshi
  youre not talking about the one where the bb gang rapes ninten right
  i prefer the mother 2 pokey x giygas one
  the one where chad comes in beating them up too
        homos and fujos begone
  im not a fujoshit or a fag tho i just know about that doujin because its been mentioned all the time in these threads
  shits good
the rseries robots are cool  theyre pretty cool for unlosable story fights
currently playing earthbound i just reached twoson when does the game gets good any tips    also why the music is so shit the only good tracks are the remakes of those from mother 1
  the game finally picks up after reaching summers i used to think it picks up at the 2nd visit to winters maybe it still does
  some new remixes  what remixes anything from mother 3
  also how the fuck did they manage to fint that world map in a nes cartridge  i will answer this tonight but its not surprising and the cart they used was big
  anticipation
    it gets good at threed and goes downhill after threed
  everything post fourside arc is shit
  post fourside  i like fourside as a location but youre daft if you think the mall and monkey cave arent anything but awful
  idnt monkey cave is post everything on fourside
  nope its before you can get to the upper floors of the monotoli building since you get the yogurt machine at the end
mother 1 is basically unplayable and mother 2 is a fully fleshed out game thats like a 9/10 for me hypothetically i could have played through the entirety of mother 1 had a decent time then played through mother 2 and id never want to touch mother 1 ever again     its kind of like whats the point of playing super mario bros 1 when you could play 3 or super mario world
  youre a fucking causal
  its a jrpg
  youre so casual you can even play one of the easiest genres
the only enemies that will fuck you in mother 1 are the ones that use pk beam gamma when you have little to no knowledge of the 2nd franklin badge and in mt itoi plateau and peak
  the suits of armor in the rosemary manor are pretty scary
  oh shit im a little tired to write it all out but the short version is basically the map consists of 57334 256x224 tiles 1 byte per tile 64x64 pixels in size there are 2048 64x64 tiles many of them blank those 64x64 tiles are made up of 16 16x16 tiles so each 64x64 tile is 16 bytes each each 16x16 tiles is made up of 4 chr graphics a chr graphic is 8x8 so it is 4 bytes each there are 4096 16x16 tiles there are also palette data but it turns out they saved space and used the upper 2 bits of the 16x16 tiles and map areas finally there is map area data split up in 4x4 64x64 tiles thats the big stuff there are little pieces too but i will ignore it i am not including map graphics because on nes games graphics are actually on a separate chip than rom data but i will say that chr gfx takes up about 12800 bytes so lets do some tired inaccurate math to see how much data the map is    256224 tiles  2048 big tiles  16 size of big tile  4096 little tiles  4 little tile size  (((256/42244 map areas    i got 106496 bytes from this calculation but it is probably more like 132656 bytes peaking at the rom map the prg rom is 262144 bytes so it is definitely significant considering the map takes up about half the rom but a 262kb rom is huge considering super mario bros 1 is 16kb or 16 times smaller    anyway i should be sleeping
    so basically the short short version is they used a big cart the map data is about the size of 8 copies of super mario bros they did use a couple of tricks
  mother 1 is basically unplayable  absolutely and objectively false its easily playable these days even without a walkthrough at least the gba version
  the gba version i sworse since you cant control encounters
fact earthbound attracts too many fucking casuals to the series they see quirky humor and writing as an invitation but go all apeshit when they learn mother 1 is harder than earthbound
mother 3  mother 2  mother 1
  bad opinion
  mother 3  above either 1 or 2
    i dont like fucking boring games why does that make me a casual     if you tell me that you would happily play mother 1 over mother 2 i think youd be a try hard and that to me is a more apt description of someone than calling me a casual would i be a casual carpenter if i didnt like smashing my balls with a hammer instead of using the hammer build things with because thats the equivalence of playing a game as dated and visually horrible as mother 1     i may like retro games but i dont play antiquated garbage to further my point would you rather play final fantasy 1 to any of the other titles i doubt it
  my point that the gba version of  mother has aged really well and it feels like youre playing a cool storydriven game instead of a boring nes jrpg
with the exception of the rolling hp meter earthbound is mechanically the same as mother
  by using unplayable i thought you were complaining about the difficulty but now that i see youre complaining about the graphics youre a tremendous casual
to tell you the truth i dont really view either as being the superior one i think each does some things better than the other eg 1 with the run button and 4th dimensional slip 2 and the rolling health meter and having a bit more content
  implying ninten wont be dlc to shill earthbound beginnings on the nes libary      haha right 
    if you use the onyx hook right before the fallin love scene you can do the entire game alone with just ninten actually
  was  why is this in past tense both games still exist and are playable
  im pretty sure that the run feature wasnt implemented in the original famicom versions
  be happy nibroc did a model of his clay design  we are never gonna have ninten in his og and commercial design as a semiclone or echo    fuck sakurai manage to reference a fucking fan trick from castlevania and falcons black costume being from that fzero x commercial yet no alternate costume referring to ninten    shit suxs
  ninten solo run  imagine the hell if youre not overlevel in mt itoi
  ahhahahhahaha how is mt itoi even real nigga ahaahahahhahah just like 4thd slip ahahhahahahhahahahhha
  gets puzzled
  they learn mother 1 is harder than earthbound  what
  what
  sakurai manage to reference a fucking fan trick from castlevania and falcons black costume being from that fzero x commercial yet no alternate costume referring to ninten  wait really when did this occur
  tfw artsy omni will gladly make a complete render for a fan character   and do a shit ton of mother3 art despite not having played the game at the time  but will only do one mother1 character eve and it was goddamn a trophy   being a ebb fan is suffering
  there is something fan project big coming for mother fans in the next year
  is it that thing ive been waiting on and off for over the course of years and actually looks and sounds competent as fuck
    it is amazing sakurai referenced this its the littlest detail he truly excels on  almost as ridley being called the cunning god of death as his boxing ring title  the official smash 64 japanese site claimed that the black costume was inspired by the fzero x commercial    and yet we dont have mother 1 stuff on ness
  which one  because mother 4 is getting rebranded into a motherinspired project psi is vox now
whats the best mother 1 track and why is it snowman  
  i really like duncans factory    
  
mother vocal cd
  earthbound is overrated garbage
  no its super ultra duper owverrated garbage
  mother is underrated kino
  imagine actually believing this
  earthbound is an overrated good game
  far from garbage and this is coming from someone who doesnt care for the game or genre in general the fanbase is vocal but they stay in their own lane from what ive seen i cant see any reason to hate this game
  theres still a lot of love for mother in smash though 4 stages 3 items and 2 characters in ultimate and sakurai added paula and poo and kumatora and boney to nesss and lucass final smashes respectively plus there was a easter egg in 4 where if you hit a starman with a charged ness side smash the smaaaaaash text would appear
  i pretty that also appears if you successfully reflect his pk beam gamma/omegas
    yfw this is the first time pk beam has ever been shown outside of mother1
  i like it anon but it isnt vr
        honestly for a literally dead series its amazing how much sakurai gives us you can tell nintendo doesnt care much about the series based on how ness and lucas never appear on promotional material but still sakurai adds a lot of cool stuff    the new psi effects lucas pk love finally being blue and seeing kumatora and boney has been some of the most exciting things for me about this game honestly
  isnt pk beam another name for pk flash
  nope its pretty much a overkill projectile version of pk thunder
  nah pk flash doesnt exist in mother1  pk beam is a strong as fuck psi move that can one shot most enemies
    but the later pk flash moves have a chance to one shot an enemy too
  i dont know about protagonist but teddy is clearly the chad in the series
  pk flash has a /chance/ to kill enemies  pk beam fucking obliterates anything
  pk beam y is a 100 sureshot  honestly nearly all gamma variations of pk attacks are so brutal as heck it always hits
  and when i mean nearly i mean pk thunder y is too shit while you can ko all enemies with pk fire omega in mother 1
  when you think about it the mother1 crew could fucking stomp bother ness and lucas gang  ninten has the best defensive psi out of anyone and 4thd slip is a instant escape  ana has the most broken psi and can one shot anything with ease plus they both has powershield making them completely invulnerable   teddys is fuckn strong as hell and lloyd just sucks
which version of mother is the best one to play  the amount of alternate versions put vns to shame
  original on nes with the official translation or else youre a filthy casual
  the 25th anniversary hack
  wait
  yeah muddy vaseline covered 3d would have been much better than what we got
so just beat mother i think i am missing somethint is giegue angry because george stole the plans that could be used to destroy his people or were the plans that george stole giegues plan to destroy earth i dont get his angle how exactly did george betray giegue and is giegues hatred of earth and assault simply because george stole his plans whatever they were
  giegues plans were information on psi and how it works and he basically gave earth and its creatures the power to use psi
best boy
  wrong picture
    george was a modern day prometheus and that pissed off giygass race
  that hack is literally the definition of soulless
  matos mother 12 retranslation is better than noas translation
  battle against a dangerous foe its fast paced plays the most often and that fucking ending sequence
  probably the ending theme is the beat but everyone forgets about that
mother 1 was the best  they got less good as they went theyre all still good mind you i just feel like they got worse for different reasons with each new one
  they went in a different direction with each game which is fine imo
you just gotta install 20 patches to make the game playable bro vanilla mother is just too hard
  no im pretty sure thats right
  haha its ok friend we all make mistakes
  what if theyre both best boy
  zoomers cant handle a easy as fuck rpg  pathetic
  now were talkin
  i always thought it wouldve been neat if one of the areas you could go was podunk in earthbound and maybe get to see a grown up ninten are any of the mother 1 locations even mentioned in earthbound
owo    
  im baffled there isnt a ssb64 hack where ness is remodeled to be more like ninten  theres literally a bomberman and falcon vertex hack now    
  not from my recollection the only thing tying eb with mother 1 is giygas
  i mean thats the only explicit thing i think m2 has all sorts of parallels and references to m1 though i am not even sure if m2 takes place on the same planet m1 takes place in rural america and m2 takes place in eagle land some sort of parallel america
  because the spic who did those eventually did another project which was a kickstarter scampaign  later fucked off and never sharing his method to do vertex hacks and adding roster slots
did you know your dog in m1 is actually a cute girl
  
  oh communism probably works fine for a town of tazmilys size honestly but i dont think tazmily was explicitly communist  i dont think the government is specified the game is not about government though it is more about turning into unnatural animals and monsters were put together as chimeras claus who should have died was revived as part machine the nowhere islands became industrialized tazmily was simple until it was annexed by porky    however i do believe the pigmasks are supposed to resemble kind of nazis their uniforms remind me of nazi uniforms and their salute is similar to the roman salute used by nazis and i guess porky is kind of awell i guess he is a monarch also chimeras were nazi experiments and they apparently may have survived for a few minutes
  more like you go back to /v/

  tits or gtfo
  all you need to do is manipulate your dog to get out of his home and into enemy spawning territory for the dog to become a cute glasses wearing school girl
paula  ana  tracy  nesss mom  venus  kumatora  minnie  mimi  nintens mom  samba  hinawa  pippi
  majority blonde
      the game makes no references to communism and anyone who thought it did is a blockhead  its much more about humanitys relationship with nature with tradition and with god and how advanced technology television propaganda and capitalism tear all of that apart and make people miserable/unfeeling drones with that in mind this is clearly a spiritual statement and not a political one a critique of modernity and civilisation as a whole not rightwing politics/economics i dont know why people try to make out that everything is political these days  like all the other games in the series mother 3 is about the importance of friends and family and people caring for one another 3 explores the reasons why unity has become rarer in modern times the beginning shows us a strong community coming together to overcome a tragedy then as the game progresses and the villagers are given happy boxes and money from their corporate jobs they become self absorbed and fragmented you also see a bunch of tourists coming into tazmily further diluting the meaning of their community
  that kumatora model is awesome and makes me sad that shes not playable
  this game stinks
  yfw you remeber that ninten is technically the one singing the song  yfw you realize this is nintens canon voice  
  enjoy what you have at least  also  forgetting about mods
one important aspect of earthbound for me is that its a silly world but all of the characters takes it seriously since that is all they know     then comes every earthbound inspired game and completely misses the point so many characters act way too selfaware of the silliness of the world making it lose all the charm    why is it so difficult to make a game feel like earthbound
  ninten a onions boy  he american dates a christian girl and beats the crap out of hippies hes far from a soi boy
  ninten is a pure american boy who likes ribs baseball cute girls and vidya games you want a sissyboy go look at lucas
      this discussion  leave /vr/ and never come back
  people see the quirk of earthbounds world but almost never make the attempt to actually see how all the humor and oddities are written     and like you said mother presents its oddities as being apart of the world its a modernist piece of writing   many earthbound if not all inspired works are postmodernist they cant have the quirks just for the sake of creating comedy its always selfreferential as if saying look at how quirky and silly we are were just like eathbound
  video games  are vidya games even ever mentioned in mother 1
  super mario bros 8 is mentioned
  a kid in the school mentions dragon quest mario in the sandhop translation and another about playing his gameboy on the roof
  in the japanese version it was dragon quest iii
  i didnt play the japanese version because im not a fag or slant eye
    always thought mother 1 took place before home consoles were a thing guess i got my timeline wrong
  they never state specific years ive always figured it was around the time of their release
  what would make you think that
  i guess the peanutslike artstyle and characters made me think it was the 50s or 60s
  nah it takes place in the 80s    i think the rural and retro qualities of the setting plus the alien abduction plot makes it very easy to think it takes place before the 70s though   for example teddy looks like a greaser the car enemies look quite old in model the robot enemies resemble robbie the robot aliens laser guns and such are often associated with 50s science fictions
  heck off
  yeah and  blondes are cute
  justify this statement
  winters sucked
enter in the thread expecting a lot of people talking about how the choice was too obvious and that everyone prefers earthbound and doesnt care about mother 1    it turns out that almost practically everyone is talking about how they prefer mother 1    what the fuck      i dont prefer either but never before in my life i saw something like this thread lol
  more people started actually playing mother 1 instead of parroting eceleb opinions about it
  people say his singing sucks but i find it adorable
  desu the upside of the 25th hack is that they made all the r703series fights play the factory theme    it fits well due to how bullshit the bosses are intentionally
  god i love the spritework in mother 1  all the enemies are just exuding personality and charm
  mother 1 got a virtual console release a few years ago so that made it accessible for most people who didnt care enough to emulate it  plus mother 1 hasnt been discussed and memed to death unlike earthbound
  many of those foes are indeed dangerous  a few really should use different themes though like the skunks
so guys im here at the fucking cemetery exactly where im supposed to rescue pipi but when i entered there was only one casket with a pseudo zombie in it i fought him and it disappeared the room is completely empty this is a quite old savegame without knowing exactly what i had done and what to do i talked to the mayor and he said that something about rescueing someone which would obviously be pipi but where the fuck are the two other caskets what did i do wrong
  have you talked to pippis mom
  i figured it out ive already rescued her in this savegame i talked to the mayors assistant and he gave me a zoo key what is the mayor even talking about
  wheres the slit at
  gaygas
  /vr/ is full of hipsters and contrarians since earthbound is the popular well known game they all say they like 1 or 3 better because theyre insecure faggots who need to be special and different theyre all good games but earthbound is easily the best all around anyone interested in being honest and objective knows it too
  you need to head to the zoo did you get the canary and found its use
  canary isnt that near the zoo from what i remember whenever you try to get to the first department store if you reach the diagonal path you first see make a hard left and you should come up to a sign and keep going left and into a field with some pillar seemingly blocking your entrance but not really
  imagine being so deluded you think anyone who doesnt have the same opinions as you is just being a contrarian
  mother is a fundamentally better game m2 is more or less a remake
  m2 is more or less a remake  i dont really know why people say this other than lazily reusing 3/4 mother 1s playable characters how is it similar enough to be a remake
  rehashed music rehashed story rehashed characters rehashed locations etc
  rehashed music  sure but most game series do that  rehashed story    rehashed locations  only magicant
    music  no pollyanna and beign firends overall inferior except for final boss 1st phase and fourside and all its variations   rehashed story  he probably meant the whole go find the eight melodies but you can say the same about the needless  rehashed locations  both games had cities snow swamp and a desert they must be a rehash  yeah its stupid at least it they had good deserts unlike mother 3
  no pollyanna and beign firends            
mother was cool that it was non linear but earthbound was better at game pacing and telling you where to go next plus fuck the random encounter mechanic no matter how edited it is through romhacks
  earthbound was better at telling you where to go next  wanting your hand held
  you know what youre right i guess simons quest has superior puzzles because it doesnt hold your hand through anything  not all games that tell you once where to go is holding your hand i dont see a giant quest marker ontop of your screen or a mission list telling you where to go at every time
  how can you get lost in mother the game pretty clearly spells out where all the song pieces are
  the map is pretty big
  for you
who was in the wrong here
  ness because we all know he was the one who truly had the biggest hips with how chubby he is
  can you imagine paula making fun of ness for being chubby while fondling his gut
  no because paulas too nice to ever make fun of ness thats something poo would do then force ness into strict training
  yeah but its not hot when poo does it  poo would totally make fun of ness for being a fat american though
  youre right its only hot when jeff does it
  that depends is winters and foggyland the canada or britain analogue
    cmon now ness isnt even that fat at least looking at his sprites
  ness weighs 4 steven universes
  it has stonehenge and the boys in the boarding school wear comically short shorts its obviously based off britain plus boarding schools in general are a really british thing      multiple npcs throughout the game make fun of ness for being chubby/fat but some to say he is skinnier after you beat the game he looks kinda chubby from his sprites especially his jap magicant ones
  please dont do this to me its november
  humiliation fetish  disgusting
  actually humiliation fat and the wonders of a childhoods discovery and early romances are all things i hold dear
  disgusting all you have to do is add handholding to that list
  you know ness maybe its time for another adventure and less pizza  paula pokes ness tummy as he bluses  she pecks him on the cheek and grabs his hand  but youre still my brave hero tummy and all  so innocent so cute reminds me of my first girlfriend from ages ago
    man could you guys imagine if we had a video game where our favorite nintendo characters could fight to see who was the strongest     its a shame nothing like that will ever happen though
  so innocent so cute reminds me of my first girlfriend from ages ago
  because unlike most earthbound fans we can actually stand an old rpg and see it for what it really is  why do you think most people love mother3 that game is the easiest to pick up and has all its messages handfisted to you where as in mother1 it takes time to get ahold and is more underground in its story    or at least thats my take on it
  is there one for the other songs
  smash ultimate roster finalized in 2015  earthbound beginnings released same year  dlc confirmed for next year  mother1s 30th anniversary is next year  switch has a libary consisting of only nes games  magicant technically is the newest mother stage and its directed at mother1  all mother1 party members are a spirit except him  he   is   in
  the base roster was finalized in 2015 sakurai confirmed about a week ago that nintendo choose the newcomers and finalized them just recently
  let him dream
  none of these compare to the fear of a gabelin
am i allowed to post this cutie here
  not /vr/ fuck off to /v/
  so much soul
  we posting sprites
  if it werent for the incredibly tedious random battles id replay this game and actually finish it this time can anyone point me to one of these romhacks mentioned in the thread that fixes it
more themes presented here
    earthbound has much more soul than mother  doesnt help that the english localization for mother is shit
  get one with the easy patch or tomatos mother12 version  avoid the 25th anniversary edition it butchered the artstyle and fucked the overworld map
bump
paula is cute and must be protected
  she gets taken by a mook and probably got groomed by a mani mani statue possessed geldegarde monotoli  
  dont forget being kidnapped by the blue blue cultists gosh what a slut ana is the purest
mother 1 if your a hipster its got that raw nes feel the looks the music its very cool    but mother 2 is better of course
  the whole mother series is literally the most hipster series on the west
    shut the fuck up you cunts paula is pure
  just because the battle system is poorly designed and grindy doesnt make it harder
  battle system is poorly designed  literally the same battle system as earthbound
    battle system on mother is the same as dragon quest  theres nothing poorly done but some enemies can act as a wall basically at the end of the game youll be fighting bosstier enemies constantly  theres ways to deal with them though if by the end of the game you have both frankling badge and healing omega you can tank them plus you have the convenience of the magicant hook and the eve chip to teleport back and forth and teleport of course  in fact you can zap through mt itoi using teleport to avoid battles  mother 1 is exactly a clone of dragon quest in terms of inventory and battles the difference is on the presentation not just the modern day setting but also the structure of the world map how you can walk in 8 directions and how towns arent submaps but actually part of a big interconnected world   like its contemporaries mother had a high rate battle counter sometimes it can be annoying but the good thing is that theyre quick and over in less than a minute most of the time this is the benefit of old rpgs no flashy graphics or animations means its really quick   i wouldnt say theres anything really wrong about mothers design mt itoi is hard as fuck so are many final game areas of many rpgs   the game provides you with a lot of options to finish the game even if youre below level 30
  people are just literally too stupid to use nintens shields buffs and debuffs    its no wonder earthbound nerfed offense up to the point of uselessness the devs knew nobody would use them anyway
  yeah that too lloyds consumable death laser is also pretty strong but you have to keep buying it in earthbound you just get the definitive bazooka and use it forever
  plasma beams are pretty cheap all things considered by the time youll be needing them for every battle enemies will give enough cash to buy them in surplus
  now this is a game thats gotten way too overrated over the past 10 years
i wish twoson and scaraba were longer like onett and threed
  paula and ness being mean to eachother  begone degenerate
  this paula is already to mentally scarred after all the rape to even confess to ness much less being mean ana is superior and purer in every way
  nigga paula would have frozen their dicks off if they even tried anything why do you think the cultists were outside of the cabin and not inside with her
  she would ran out of pp sooner or later
  but gotten a lot more pp soon after
  there were only two of them she could handle it
  anafag is also a degenerate  cease
  implying the whole gang didnt have their way during all the time she was caught    just stating the facts your waifu isnt pure
  she was level 1
its called earthbound dickhead
all this shitposting about paula being raped  degenerates the lot of you
  true she enjoyed it gosh what a slut
  stop sexualizing underage children
  threed   almost nothing happens there what u saying
  mother 2 is better but i enjoy mother 1 more i can understand finding it a slog but i personally dont see it that way  also i would play ff1 over 13 and others if i felt like it that day
  quality post  a big part of the weirdness i think is that it creates a feeling similar to a young kid exploring the world playing the game everything feels foreign strange and slightly uneasy even things as an adult you should be familiar with fast food joints hotels etc feel odd and when something crazy comes out of nowhere its like being a kid trying to make sense of something new  thats my perspective anyway
  anyone interested in being honest and objective knows it too  almost everyone itt who say they prefer mother 1 admit this  also as someone else pointed out 1 2 and 3 are all pretty different even if the first two seem very similar
  a feeling similar to a young kid exploring the world playing the game everything feels foreign strange and slightly uneasy even things as an adult you should be familiar with fast food joints hotels etc feel odd and when something crazy comes out of nowhere its like being a kid trying to make sense of something new
  i liked mother1 more because the story felt more fleshed out the characters joining you felt natural instead of being being thrown at you poo comes to mind   the combat felt more tame since i didnt have a rolling meter aggravating me every battle and i love the peanutsesque artstyle of the characters    i could go on why i consider it my favorite of the trilogy but im sure you get my point
lloyd is the slowest party member in the entire mother series
  well yeah hes obviously retarded
    if you like this game clearly your just being a hipster
    which means hes the perfect target for offense up
how am i supposed to legit go through this dungeon which is built like a labyrinth where every room/corridor look like each other am i supposed to draw a map on a piece of paper
  just meander your way to the top floor checking every present can net you some sweet loot a psi stone and i think a second franklin badge too
  underrated post
  duncans factory is the low point of the game heres a map if you need it
bread will also save your ass if you use it but not eat it i think you plant the crumbs back in merrysville over by the rocks to save time after using the onyx hook of course
  ana isnt pure either she cucked ninten for teddy
  t anafag  you guys are worse than kumafags
  thats impossible since im pretty sure theres only 2 anafags on this entire site and ive never seen a anafag outside of this board trust me kumatorafags on /v/ are by far the worst you can tell that 99 of them just have a shitty tomboy fetish and havent even played a mother game
i personally would like to fuck nintens grandma
  fair enough
  unsheathes defense down or offense up
  not unsheathing 4th dslip  teleports away from you
  wasting 16 pp
alright lissinup what if pokey fucking with time jazzed things such that there were some splits and loops its an excuse for this the cast of mother 1/2/3 end up remixed to your choice which means that ninten loid ana and teddy could experience mother 3 in place of the original 4 and so on you can keep one timeline cast the same if you swap two others if you want assume pokey is obsessed in 3 with whoever was protag in 2    how do you remix
  lucas and claus somehow both get into nesss place and porky gets jealous over their brotherly love and claus once again is a retard and goes to try and stop giygas himself and gets fucked up again porky then becomes obsessed with trying to become lucass new twin brother but once again he can only show it by being a dick to lucas
why are mother threads here so fucking shitty  people arguing why liking one over the the other game is contrarian   dude what if this character was raped xdd like this is some edgy mario parody   bunch of shitty meme shit like chad vs virgin and similar garbage  i dont think even /v/ mother threads are this bad i used to love discussing my favorite series here its just embaressing and makes me feel like im on a youtube comments section
  you know you can always just try and make good discussion other than shitposting yourself or just post more art
  shitposting is posting something with the intention of it being low quality i dont see how my post is shitposting    all im saying os the people in these threads feel juvenile if this is due to them being younger posters or not is impossible to say but i feel it might be the reason
  its just a result of the anons in the mother threads usually being the same anons and most stuff to discuss has already been talked to death especially since some retard keeps making these threads right after one dies /v/ threads are a gamble you get a bunch of anons that discuss stuff or you get kumatorafags or shitposters that or the thread just dies before it gets to 10 posts
  yeah thats true i dont know who keeps making these threads one after another i love the series but i dont need to discuss it 24/7 maybe every couple of months or so a nice mother thread would be good to see not on a daily basis     i just wish these threads didnt degrade to such a terrible quality
  if you think this is bad take a look at any general on /vg/ thats run out of things to discuss trust me this thread is far from terrible theres few things more soulcrushing than watching a general of a game you like slowly turn into a degenerate circlejerk of offtopic discussion theres a reason everyone hates being exiled to /vg/
  you say it like this is some sort of general when op only asked which was better
i try to make quality posts in these threads but sometimes i just want to make a quick shitpost to keep the thread afloat
  you dont belong here
is it possible for ninten to travel on the tracks solo
  do you not need lloyd to break the rock to the tracks
  youll have to get lloyd first and then get ana and teddy then use the onyx hook when ana takes you into the room alone now you can beat the game as ninten alone
    no i meant the subway train tracks the one where you get punished hard by gabilans and nancys
i just got earthbound beginnings and i am really liking it so far i just got to magicant i like how big the world is and how it doesnt hold my hand the grinding sucked at first but i really am enjoying it now the atmosphere is pretty good so far too
  yeah just be sure to get the onyx hook in magicant itll make backtracking a lot easier later be sure to get the defense coins for any new party members you get later on
  the only thing i have bought so far is the wooden bat is there anything else i need to buy by this point i only got two tunes so far
  asthma spray is good just so you wont get a game over to the car enemies
i like paula
    ninten cant use asthma spray while having an attack though thats important
itt weebs referring to earthbound as mother 2
  aeris/aerith tier autism
couldnt get in as an echo for either ness or lucas  couldnt even be an alt skin for ness  magicant is more heavily based on mother2 instead of mother1  not even metioned in any of the sm4sh trohy descriptions  entire earthbound beginings cast got spiritd  porky is probably gonna be dlc meaning mother 2  3 are only ever getting recognition  and on his 30th birthday nonetheless  sakurai doesnt like mother 1 does he
  porky dlc  lol no
  game got datamined and porky is completely missing  and considering sakurai acknowladges hiss existence its safe to assume otherwise
  earfbundt
  yea you can run through but its long and the enemies are super tough if you manage to make it you can get ana really early
look up encyclopedia mother since im curious for some info  find this comic in it  thats nintens mom  damn son
  ninten drawn in a crude shinchanish style  his mother is drawn like a typical 80s anime girl  what a weird contrast
  heres another one for ya  lloyd  lets move this rock using the big missile thats at duncans factory    lloyd  you probably would have been better off if i hadnt become your friend
this shit is so nice to listen to while moving around the world  
  ban mother 3 and click the lamers
just beat earthbound a few hours ago and damn was it an amazing experience manly tears were shed      im kinda interested in mother 3 but without spoiling what is its connection to earthbound if there is one beyond being in the same series like do any characters appear in 3 any storylines that connect to stuff in earthbound
  mother 3 is a little bad become big bad episode
i like the plot of mother 1 more but the story is better in 2
tfw wandering in mother 1 getting lost and turning overleved
i am spooked
  i played it before i played mother 2 and enjoyed it
  manly tears were shed  dont ever play nier or nier automata mate you will kill yourself    mother 3 is fantastic probably my favourite of the 3 its not tied to eb in any way that i can remember though apart from being written by itoi and being a slightly quirky and wonderfully unique scenario
1/8 chance of breaking lloyd battle items  reeeeeee
  i thought it was 1/12  and that applies to psi stones too have fun
i think summers is a pretty great area its the only place to fight duke nukemlike people and the locations pretty memorable with a few setpieces
so whats your favorite enemy the hippie is mine
  smilin sphere
  reab yddet
  desperation attacks suck harder than pk beam gamma attacks fuckin grizzlybears
  /vr/  mother
  shotafags get the fuck out of my board
  implying itoi isnt secretly a shotacon when he puts stuff like pic related into earthbound  not to mention lucass ass in mother 3 and the unused naked claus sprite
  gay  european  why even bother with the distinction
  ill give you the naked shota butt in 2 and 3 but it doesnt give you the right to make lewd of ness/ninten/lucas and their friends
  not my fault that itoi lewds them himself
  gay or european its hard to guarantee is he gay or european
  whats with the piss filter jesus
so whatever happened to the people who sang the vocal mother 1 soundtrack i know catherine warwick completely disappeared but what about the other singers
ignore the miscolored tile on the top
  i love mother 1 but the probable answer is that /vr/ is full of contrarians literally look at all the threads up now fellating castlevania chronicles
  nice how much progress have you made
  not much been busy 
  i love mother 1 but the probable answer is that /vr/ is full of contrarians    no fuck off i genuinely enjoy mother more than earthbound and if you actually bothered to read the thread you might be able to see why myself and others feel that way
  keep at it youve got me interested
currently playing mother 3 after beating eb and im not too sure what to think of it    the battle system is kind of an improvement but it being split into chapters and having all these characters to play instead of just 1 i dunno its just weird to me    and looking at the guide theres apparently 8 chapters im on chapter 3 and still not playing as lucas    the story isnt too bad also definitely a different more serious tone im not sure what story is better at the moment
where can i buy psi stones in mother 1
  if youre going on a casual playthrough with an end game ninten whos past level 25 your biggest opportunities to obtain psi stones is through killing starmen and certain mt itoi peak enemies if you can kill the latter two enemies without losing to them   you cant buy psi stones in mother 1 however there are 6 that can be obtained without need to battle
  most likely the most reasonable post in this mostly toxic thread but to play the devils advocate  tazmily resembles intentionally or otherwise an anarchistcommunist society  there is no state classes or market  villagers all work to the extent they can to cover everyones needs  no wage slavery everyone is productive through occupations they chose to pursue  direct democracy  to be honest as views and definitions differ one could call tazmilly a mutualist anarchist or protocommunist society what makes it awkward is that material conditions for communism to develop wouldnt apply to it as it is indeed a fictional society that doesnt follow our worlds transitions and history we dont come from a ship that set sail after humanitys last war  thats what makes it more abstractly ideological or artistic than political politics do leak into everything for better or for worse thats hard to deny but that doesnt make everything highly political
  furthermore i think its fair to say that the game is critical of society its development and how it affects everyday life as well as the meaninglessness of material pursuit in this aspect it can be partly extended as a disillusioned view of capitalism its probably at its most straightforward when money is introduced and directly along with greed and jealousy critique of capitalism isnt the games only theme but its one of the motifs
  child nudity is inherently sexual  fucking kill yourself
im playing through mother 1 right now and i got to the mountain again after the one boss fight you arent supposed to win is it worth it to grind and finish the game or if im bored should i just start 2 instead
  mt itoi is the end of the game  go back and find the boat
  yes the end of the game is good
  did you get teddy how many melodies do you have what lvl are you
  i love mother 1 but the probable answer is that /vr/ is full of contrarians  or  we just like the game for what it is
    thanks lads    yep getting the one from the fucking cactus right now 30
kino dance
just for fun i tried out my program with the mother 25th anniversary hack
what is this
  abducted humans
  thats were all of the people disappeared too i find it odd that earthbound builds up giygas to be a huge threat but only a few people end up actually getting captured unlike in mother 1 where an entire fucking town gets abducted
  the starman tunnels in winters have people in these types of pods
  it wasnt nearly as many as you see in mother 1
  looks neat
  almost 500 replies  nobody has posted the actual best mother 1 track  
  i think this one gets slept on since everybody forgets about the 3 minute section where you can hear it which is unfortunate because thats actually a really good track
  its a goodhack but i wouldnt play it over the orignal the altered map layout and the fact the cactus blends in with everyting was a chore    still nice though
  good 30 is a pretty good level 40 is when ana and ninten peak in psi so keep that in mind head to youngtown and learn teleport if you havent
imo mother is like a rough draft of eb
  absolute pleb
  real question is why people were even abducted in 2
  mother is toy story  earthbound is toy story 2
  probably to make experiments like pic related  or to stop ness and co since most of the people abducted were key on helping ness find gyiyg
  toy story 1 was iconic and toy story 2 was forgettable tho
  )))
  like mr t
why arent there more psychic npcs
  lets be honest hear the actual story to earthbound is forgettable people remember pokey giygas and the sanctuaries but nothing else
  here
  nintens dad is a giant
  what was he going to talk about
  it is the end of the game mother there is nothing after the and
  hes a big guy
  for you
reeeeeeee why are real eb carts so expensive
i dont get why mother 1 gets hated so much the sprites are charming and the high encounter rate is manageable with quick battles and repel rings do people just not have patience
  mother is like a rough draft of eb  just because the sequel takes inspiratiion from the previous doesnt mea you should compare the two you dont see people say nes zelda is a prototype link to the past right
  its because the majority of mother fans are also smash fans so its unlikely youll see them talk about anything other then those 2  3 why else do you think mother fans get so hostile at the mention of ninten in smash to them hes just protoness   besides when they do play mother 1 they get hit hard by its classic dragon quest gameplay so it turns them off more easily    or at least thats my idea on why
  you have to understand that theres a different mentality between zelda and earthbound fans  earthbound fans just hate the very notion of mother 1 existing so they collectively try to bury it or discredit it dont play mother its too hard dont play mother its just a first draft of earthbound if you do play mother at least install patches or us a remake with earthbounds tileset    earthbound fans actively try discredit mother 1 whereas zelda fans celebrate zelda 1
  i am a zelda fan and i dont care for zelda 1
  thanks for announcing your bad taste
  i fucking hate this because your right any time theres an earthbound content creator theres almost no chance they played mother 1   hell even earthbound themed channels on youtube only see the game as a predeccesor of mother 2 and nothing more for fucks sake when the game got localized everyone was pissed it wasnt mother 3  it fucking sucks man and since were likely getting porky as a new earthbound character in smash its just gonna get worse  at least japan appreciates it
  im an eb fan and i prefer 1 to 3
  i just beat it holy shit man
  ayy how was it dude
    whats the best translation of mother to play
is ninten kenshiro in a little boys body
  nes earthbound has the new script where as tomatos 12 version is a direct translation of the japanese version
  ninten is actually named ken in the mother novel so maybe
  a fucking japanese headband when hes supposed to be american  what the fug
so whats the best ending for mother 1  the japanese ending is at holy loly/mt itois peak the characters stay there as the ending credits roll on  the extended noa ending which was also added to the japanese gba port has the actual events that happen afterwards revealing a happy ending with teddy still alive apparently in japan teddy was thought dead or seriously badly injured but on the extended ending we see him forming his own rock band and doing excellent  i like to know that the game ends well but i feel the original kind of ambiguous ending was more impactful and sort of became iconic that way  pic unrelated for some reasons it was on my mother folder
  same reason teddy has a katana and one of anas favorite albums is japanese according to the mother encyclopedia
getting back llyod to replace teddy feels like shit
  and why ninten has a baseball signed by a japanese play  or how teddys favorite book is about a japanese singer
  dont trigger the cutscene
forgot to save before beating gilgas last save was before eve feels bad man
  but thats even better now you can play the eve part anytime
is it worth replaying mother 1 with the anniversay fanmod or is it too souless
i never use anas pk a attacks they feel too shit to use and rather just guard and heal desu
  well i can certainly tell you that her freeze and beam attacks saved my ass multiple times during my playthroughs
  her alpha attacks
  you really have to know which moves to use
  depends do you like square trees that look like super mario pipes
george is the true villian of the series
  you think if the ayys were so pissed at them for stealing their psi info that they would send a more powerful ayy than one that cries when they hear a song george probably only stole giygass class essay on psi and only giygas cares about it
which status ailment is good if any i used a rope on starman jr and it made the whole fight a pushover
  he was the leader of the ayys wasnt he
def down/up doesnt affect psi atks right
  physical attacks only
  try and use defense down alot it works like a charm
eb cart is 500 minimum  what the fuck
  just buy the japanese mother 2 boxed for 20
hello
  for some reason nintens exp increased
la  summers  podunk/magicant/onett  everything else
  la  
  porky  smash  likely    not sure why you believe this but you are so wrong its hilarious
  /v/ is throwing a shitshow because all brawl bosses are spirits except porky  the only mention of porky in smash is the absolutely safe capsule  truth be told id rather have giegue or ninten since porky was never really my first choice for a mother rep
  porky is only ever fought while he is inside some sort of giant ship literally too big for smash also mother is a finished series and nitnendo would want to promote newer series
  and which one is better as in more fun
  well i perfer the nes version since it had more charm imo
looks like this thread is auto saging but real quick can someone tell me the best version of mother 1 to play i dont want to grind
  gba version with the easy mode patch fucking casual
  famicom
from the absolute trash littering their home computers to the more competent attempts of companies like core generally speaking this country only seemed capable of producing mediocre games or at best games teetering on the lower and of average they seem really good at programming and pushing systems to their absolute limit like in pic related and tons of computer demos but they seem to fundamentally misunderstand what it is that makes games fun
  pic related  whoops i was planning on posting this pic of sonic r
  shit
europe  country  this isnt talking about retro games this is just /int/ shitposting
  what do you call it a region
  what is grand theft auto  what is gianna sisters  what is goldeneye   what is donkey kong country  what is elite  yeah thats about it pretty much
  nation state
they invented and sell large quantities of farming simulator  thats all you need to know
  what is rayman and tetris
  but richard garriott is english and literally one of the best game designers of all time
thats just like your opinion man
  invented
  you might want to read this before spouting any more bullshit    europe is continent eu is a supranational political and economic union
spawned a whole new genre    first game to come up with the technique to use 3d models in 2d prerendered backgrounds  technique which then influenced the entire indstury up until the ps2 era think of how even games like final fantasy vii or ocarina of time used it etc    one french guy
  so in another words it was yet another euro tech demo
  you missed the spawned a whole new genre part
  dodging the point that it isnt a good game
  shitposting because you are fishing for easy yous isnt a good game either
  im still mad settlers 1  2 were build around hexes and not squares it would make roadlaying so much easier
  i can hear your sweating fat ass from reading this post ameriburger
  what im looking at
  some trash
  alone in the dark
  they are bad for you because nintendo isnt there otherwise they wouldve good and praised by the zelda and metroid lovers in here
  cool /v/tard /int/tard thread

  what ive noticed when playing european games is that they are usually very well made when it comes to graphics sounds and presentation but the gameplay just isnt there it feels off like they were made by talented people that obviously put a lot of effort on developing their games but seemed to lack the knowledge of what makes a game fun or maybe they just didnt think that this was important
  rise of the robots  anon
why would you post this on /vr/      team 17 naughty dog gremlin dma design bullfrog adeline software international so many great euro devs what are you talking about
  apologies about naughty dog  replace that with rare
  3d was a mistake so many sims and strategies from germany went to shit once theyve left isometric
when the op is starting the thread by not knowing the difference between a continent and a country you know were in for a winner
     what is gianna sisters   what is grasping at straws
idk op pic related is pritty gud definitely above average its an 8/10 for sure  t burger boomer
europe was just a shitty place when it came to games back in the day 5/6 speed games my fuck eurofags are so butt hurt about it that they still shit post here about how they all modded their consoles and played import games for 60hz
  euros played games at superior 70hz
  crysis is decent but far cry has overshadowed it completely and i semiironically love classic tomb raider    im a euro myself but i agree we largely have no idea what were doing and it saddens me
  would like to add that 80s/early 90s stuff like another world and captain/commander blood has a large place in my heart as well with atmosphere no us/jap games have really tapped into in the same way
what is wipeout
  europe  country    mutt education
  games made in europe were normal speed in europe dumbo
  eu flag  really good at programming   reall good at pushing systems to their absolute limit    well i work for a macroregional eu program which is good and useful and i passed out from exhaustion in an austrian castle at a eu party before so both checks out
  same here it always felt like they got bogged down on the technical side of things and kept pushing for more complexity and depth with no regard for whether or not any of it was enjoyable or even made sense
  dont know about europe but germans are unable to separate work from play which is how they came up with gothic
  what are a handful of overrated games spread out over 20 years    rise of the robots  grasping at this many straws      congrats for listing the only passable euro devs
well at least norway somehow managed to make the best pc ever
     all genesis games were made in europe
um no sweety  europe generally sucked because noone was going to waste their lives running a software gaming company in those days that took epic america/jap retardation to do
europe will never make good games never ever when theyre getting swamped with rapefugees rapefugees which by the way happen to be durka durka goat fuckers who hate vidya enjoy your sharia
  such a sperg he cant parse sarcasm
  this
    sour grapes the post
  factual economic data  sour grapes  shit anon its like you never realised the chief reason why there was almost nothing aside indie dev in all of europe was the fact nobody wanted to invest in that branch at all and the existing devs were predominately but not exclusively hobbists all while amerifat in the same time pumped money in that because amerifat
  perhaps it had something to do with the fact that european laws cuck citizens so hard that they dont want to/dont have the money to set up companies while americans have better opportunities when it comes to starting businesses just think of how many of the biggest companies in the world are based in america as opposed to europe
  2/10 made me post gif
  yikes
  hes correct the government taxes entrepreneurs out the ass
this country    do you fuckers not have schools in the usa
  call of duty dlc  checkmate europoors
yall laughing about us yuros when the yuro scene was and is perfectly fine and huge and the big question mark is actually south america
  where i live we have state capitalism and 3m people which means that big companies dont exist and its more profitable for companies to research technology instead of making games because of the state research fund  compare that to the industry in usa and 100x more people and you can easily see the reason
  they really dont  also trying to convince an american that europe consists of many different countries with different ruling structures and culture  is like convincing an ape to not eat its own shit
  everyone fucking knows that retard i just didnt know what to call the entire landmass itself since ive never had to before
  are you at least semiaware that a we are talking /vr/ here predominately 80s and b you have no clue how taxation works at all and c treat europe as a country befitting a moron
  i never had to use word continent  are you retarded retarded or retarded mutt education at its fucking finest
  no sweetie your backwater continent is just so irrelevant that up until now ive never had to refer to it in this manner
  i cant tell if this is trolling or not
  nobody ever talks about europe here
  the funny thing about threads like this is that you can have both there are actual retards with no idea what they are even talking about and still trying to bait anyway       and
  stay mad its obvious youve only latched onto that one mistake in the op to avoid the fact that europe has always been shit at making good games
  whatever you say mutt
  what am i projecting now youre the one using words wrong
japan pink gayness  usa gritty brownness  britain happy medium which everyone knows is best
  britain gritty gayness  britain pink brownness    can confirm  
  jp pedos  us psychos  eu pedo psychos
  the thread is about european games
because good euro games arent considered euro games theyre just games
    butthurt the post
    yes it is anon your games sucked all of them
because most european governments subsidize game development meaning that funding is less on merit design and appeal and more about waiting for your place in line to receive government gibs  thanks socialism
  wtf thats like one of the biggest appeal of the game    also pic related for building roads
  he hasnt played the ultimate tapan kaikki
  roads can be build only on three axis you literally cant build them straight if you want go up or down this annoys me to no end especially once buildings start to get dense  having all 4 axis from square grid instead of hex would be great
  roads can be build only on three axis  there is an intersection with four directions in the pic of 
parasite eve remake incoming
  mobile game calling it
  that or ots action trash
  this makes the most sense given squares track record with the ff series
i do remain somewhat hopeful even more so than 99 of other remakes pe is already a single player action jrpg and the framework for a remake has already been developed with games like ff13 and ff15 i absolutely hated ff13 because you could only input commands for the party leader and i assume that ff15 is no different however these engines could actually work well with pe since you are only controlling one character in pe anyway if done properly it could actually be amazing
  hell yeah
  to be fair record keeper gets legit good once the difficulty ramps up
  peeve
  you actually play mobile games
  the final fantasy general on /vg/ consists almost entirely of mobile games unfortunately those are the better games in the franchise rn
  3rd birthday is unironically a brilliant game that trolled literally everyone
adam and parasite eve not adam and parasite steve
  15 actually lets you swap characters during battle and they each have different mechanics    its not a bad game but it lacks depth and challenge
  implying you wouldnt love to be bent over by ayas superhuman strength and rammed full of her 8 inches of pulsating mitochondria infused cock
  i definitely do especially if her feet are involved
  i was super surprised by how fun 3rd birthday was i didnt care for the story though
  we can only hope
  squeenix  current year 3    dont get your hopes up anon
the only thing ill be looking forward to for any future pe games is the porn
    the best game in the series is parasite in city
and here i am just burned a disk so i can play it in december
  i dont think thats a parasite eve game
  yep    better off that way too i dont know why people get wet over the idea of remakes theyre inevitably worse than the original enhanced graphics doesnt improve games simplified gameplay doesnt improve games and adding hours of pointless dialogue doesnt expand the story it just turns the entire thing into fanfiction
because the last one worked out so well
  my dick says it is wouldnt you trust your dick
      new movie by their film department thats still a thing remember
  no didnt they shut that down after the final fantasy movie bombed
  no they used that studio to make advent children kingsglaive and some of the cg cutscenes in all of the games past ffix
  its not a hard concept to understand why people can be excited for remakes but yeah they rarely go over well all the devs have to do is make the game look prettier with modern day graphics while leaving the gameplay unchanging and i will cum buckets for a pe remake if it does get remade it will be shit though to this day the only good remake is remake
  gameplay is legit good its just the rest that its a mess
  i seriously hope not  horror without survival  scriptfest  fully imbued with cinematics perhaps unskippable ones  kidmode aka too fucking easy gameplay  qtes  dlcs  maybe ill not be entirely correct mine are just speculations based on the current videoludic situation im certain that everyone here knows that bringing back into vogue something that was so beautiful back then its often if not always a very bad idea especially if the people working behind it are scumbags only driven by a gratuitous cash in of a previous success and ultimately not even passionated enough  let those games sleep peacefully for fucks sake we already have too much examples of titles that should have died long long ago
  or squeenix is about to break another exclusive agreement with sony and needs another placeholder exclusive in the form of another reissued game for ps4
could just be securing the trademark for a rerelease of the psx game
  it says a lot about the state of final fantasy that the spinoffs are often better than the main games i consider bravely default and fft the best final fantasy games
  spiderman on the ps4 has an option to completely disable qtes disabled gamer advocates have been speaking out against them and games have been given bad reviews because of them the pushback is long overdue but it is happening    in fact i recall someone planning a class action lawsuit on behalf of disabled gamers to force developers to have basic accommodation for games much like how a building is expected to be wheelchair accessible
  horror without survival   huh i love legitimate survival horror as well but pes action horror jrpg was amazing and i hate the direction re went with 4 wow
blocks your path
  hello
  file look at those beautiful thighsjpg 65 kb 500x374  you are now aware of how many people in this thread alone fapped to aya in her lewd black evening attire
  i fapped more to eves pantsu in 3rd birthday
  i require pictorial evidence of this good sir
  have you played 3rd bd you can move the camera and look up her skirt and her clothing breaks down when she takes damage
  another good ip is going to get shit on  fuck
anyone got any leads on some good aya brea foot porn
give me the sperm and nobody gets hurt
  no it doesnt
whats her name again
  as absurd as this does sound this is probably the best thing activism has lately been aiming for i support this very much we already have colour blind mode in some games so this is a good next step you know what would be cool a bullet time trigger in one of those handicapped controller you hold a button to slow down the game until you landed the jump or are happy with your input shouldnt be too difficult to implement if you play retro games on a modern console
  i live in the eu and we didnt had pe1 i would like a physical port/remaster
  sperm denier
  only 8 characters
  i used to simply call her names like bitch slut whore etc solely for the reason of amusing me when another character talks with her
  i always name her rinoa maybe next time i will call her aya
  it would funny if it let you rename the other characters as well
  her name is eve its right in the damn title parasite eve but since its a japanese game they put her first name second
  so fucking disrespectful
  pe1 was a solid game  pe2 was desperate to be resident evil with coke product placement  pe3 wasnt even a pe game at all it was some other game that they slapped pe characters onto after the fact    what makes you think that theyre going to do anything but fuck up here
  i mean the series did have a mobile game before
  pe2 was desperate to be resident evil with coke product placement  it was a really great game with lots of replay value plenty of guns plenty of spells plenty of monsters    the only thing it lacked was alternate outfits for aya and multiple endings i wanted one more fight against no 9    pe had its charm but also a bunch of issues  long unskippable sequences  shitty graphics by 1998  most spells are useless  most weapon effects are useless  most weapon types are shit compared to pistols and rifles machineguns especially suck  gun modding system gives you ridiculously op guns as long as you what youre doing  keys take up inventory slots and are not discarded after use except in the hospital    the first time i played i dont know what i was doing and i gimped my gun so much
  yes it does all of the 4 main characters are controllable
  i actually dont find those kinds of dresses and heels to be attractive and prefer her normal practical attire
  somehow i can imagine enjoying an re4style remake of this game thats me accepting the inevitable betrayal of its original concept    ayas got some moves that sets her aside from military or swat it would be cool to see her use melee/pe counters enemies especially those golems the puzzles would have to be better than re4 though yeesh
  parasite eve was never actually referred to as a survival horror game by squaresoft it is in fact a cinematic rpg and was designed as such from the beginning anyone who talks about parasite eve being survival horror is in fact an idiot as well as anybody who doesnt think it is all about the cinematics and the narrative the gameplay is designed to carry the narrative and isnt designed to be incredibly deep or involving either it is simple action and simple math made for casual yet not totally braindead play    it is in many ways the perfect concept of how an rpg should be designed and also not actually in any way about survival or horror so much as its just about science fiction and storytelling
  it is in many ways the perfect concept of how an rpg  an onrails story i think you meant graphical adventure with shooting monsters and tuning guns
   weapon types are shit compared to pistols and rifles machineguns especially suck  machine guns are the best weapon type you fool
  an onrails story  fucking exactly the only game that does a nonlinear rpg with an open ended narrative and sequence with branching paths correctly is steambot chronicles and nobody is ever going to make a game that way in the west
  take forever to shoot  consume ammo like niggers  pistolsrifles
  correct also nothing is more broken than a pistol with rate of fire 2
  how about a pistol with a rof of 1 and triple action
  can you even set rof to 1 i thought 2 was the lowest i need to replay it soon im overdue
  you can remove the rof modifier with a super tool
  also the m8000 dropped by the trex has no rof modifier
    dang i will have to remember that for the next run
  plenty of guns  iirc there were a lot more guns in the original desu
  machineguns shoot the fastest out of all the guns    machinegunpistolrifleshotgungrenade launcherrocket launcher    any rof mod can be overwritten by a better one like x2 or x3 which are the only ones you should ever use and random rof can be overwritten by spread but otherwise actually only increases your damage rate without splitting it between bullets unless youre using the worst version of it which you shouldnt
  they were all the same with different stats      ok
pe2  pe1
  after you buy the royal edition and download all updates and dlc making the game take up 100 gigs of space sure base game is only noctis
  it gets the survival horror label because a lot of people thought it felt like a combination of re2 and ffvii when it came out in america    also if re4 is a survival horror labeled as such on the back of its box then pe meets the apparently very loose requirements too    basically any game with action/adventure elements and monsters is a survival horror game
  nope
  yep
  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  for real though people love to shit on pe2 but i feel like its a great game it does go in the opposite direction of the original and without the epic new york set pieces so i understand people not liking it though
  i really liked the game but it makes little sense as a survival horror with numerical damage and leveled abilities i liked dead spaces approach to enemies with unclear health and weakspots you just have to learn by experiences messing with your pe abilities to alter the attack style similar to ds3 would be fun too
  nope
  it wasnt survival horror it was an action rpg that looked similar to re because it was designed by the same people
  where does one find a super tool
  one in the subway one in the museum
  i named her stacy
  jill
  thanks
  citation needed faggot i dont believe this for a second
  
  one guy  designed by the same people  wow one guy is really a whole dev team from capcom
  also if re4 is a survival horror labeled as such on the back of its box then pe meets the apparently very loose requirements too  biohazard 4 is actually called a psycho adventure on the japanese box art while biohazard 2 is called a survival horror its anyones guess as to  what did shinji mikami mean by this  but its clear that resident evil 4 is only a survival horror game because the na advertisement team didnt give a fucking shit about anything other than getting idiots to buy their god damn zombie monster game youre an idiot if you get your info from people whose job is to take your money
      
  i feel like it probably has more in common with the galerians
  this is not a good thing in 2018
i wonder if they will follow the conspiracy stuff from pe2 it was about the same stuff that happened in the shitty re movies  i think i would prefer it to take a different path
i didnt know rate of fire split your damage with each bullet so i restarted the game and only used the m16 as soon as i got it and never modded it higher than a rof of 2
  good also elemental damage nerfs your gun except against creatures that are vulnerable to that element dont use it  remember to put all your bps on the attack stat of your gun
  im not doing a playthrough of it now that one was from a few years ago im guessing bp is shit for your personal stats when i played i put half in active time and the rest into the m16s damage
  the thing is that if you put it in active time it wont carry to the next playthrough and you need like 600 attack to kill the chrysler boss
  guess ill do a new save file if i ever decide to play the game again are the weapons you get from farming junk worth it
  they have around 120150 attack the gun you get from the trex has 57 so thats a difference of about 100  you can get like 20000 bp from beating one round of the game which tranlates into 200 attack added to a gun and it way easier and less tedium to beat the game rather than farm junk  on the other hand ak47
why do all square games have based black men
  when i first played the game i decided to change her name to maya this made a few parts of the plot really hard to follow
  this might actually be true
  she must be ripping a massive fart how is her leg just hovering in the air like that it must smell bad too shes covering her nose
  the p90 is basically the best gun since you can make it pretty much perfect if you skip the element mods but it would be a better use of your time to just kill dinosaurs for bp since it basically works out to 1000bp  1 atk and dinos give 13 atk per fight you have to level up or advance chapters to get that bp though if you fight green dinosaurs for junk the game will basically be cake by the time you get enough for 300 junk since you break the level cap at 38 or so and can level up easily after that trivializing any challenge that was left    theoretically you could also collect all the cards and items in the tower and merge everything onto one super perfect piece of gear with all the bonuses and none of the penalties getting the super toolkit from vance by finding enough rare cards takes a while but the tower also hands out supertools while you climb it theres also a couple other guns just sitting in the tower that are as good as the best junk guns
  his coalburner exwife payed the toll
  his wife was black his kid was brown too
  the kids was light brown the wife was white
as long as is not like the psp game that was disappointing played it for 10 hours and all upgrades i found were just passive stat boosts unlike the original where you had crazy magic along with weapon customization psp game was just boring after a while
  it had more weapon customization than pe1 but youre right about the spells    it did have grenades multiple outfits and clothing damage
  the wife was white  lmao no youre just a sniveling little cuck   
  did you even read what you linked
  douglas is daniels best friend anon he used to be daniels partner
  do you realize the article never states her race and implies she may although unlikely be white    i say she was white because the kid was lighter color than daniel
  how do you know he wasnt adopted do you think that all black people have the same shade of skin do you think that mixing race is like mixing paint when its based on sets of genes and paired alleles what if ben is simply the exact same color as his mom and picked up daniels recessive pigment genes instead and hes just got the same eyebrows or earlobes as dan    the point is that youve extrapolated all your own baggage out of one thing for pretty much no reason other than you have baggage
  how do you know he wasnt adopted  grasping at straws    stop projecting faggot
  what would you say if i told you that your cognitive dissonance was being manipulated by a third party
  that youre paranoid
  ask him if his cognitive dissonance is being used or directed by others systematically  he rationalizes the possibility away to solve the cognitive dissonance of the question  really makes you not think
  square enix  shit doa
if they trademarked parasite eve it means they are using the novels ip so the story will have to be about mitochondria if they were going to use a different story they wouldnt bother with paying for the name just like they did with 3rd birthday
  i fucking hope so
so im giving my nephew a retropie for his birthday and got a 32 gb sd card to fill up with everything     is there a good place to get roms for a retropie what would you recommend
sure you know how a magnet link works    magnetxturnbtihf36012c79151b2a3b759c6dd66a340e56ebefaf8dnnointro2018
  sure but the file seems to be 37 gb
  yes and
  why would you give that shit to a kid  guaranteed hell get lost in the menus or fuck something up    its not idiot proof like a snes classic
  i stated i only had a 32 gb sd card though       seems like a good deal
  good deal  because its cheap  youll spend just as much with the sd card and buying a controller that isnt complete crap  hdmi wires and whatnot    just buy a nes classic or snes classic and hack it in 5 mins  it has a picture menu not a list of games with no covers
  then download the file and then get rid of something gba takes up like 11 gb
  tfw someone is too broke they cant afford 5060  wew lad im sure pinching all those pennies to buy crap is great
  okay

i never played any of the pc dungeons and dragons games but seeing their covers hits me with huge nostalgia since i would play the tabletop book games the logos really get me especially the advanced dungeons and dragons tsr and ssi logos
  im honestly just amazed someone else has heard of clockwork knight
  its one of the more famous saturn games everybody on the board heard of it and every saturn owner who was alive back then heard of it
  this guy  is right i didnt even have the game and my friend banged on about it so much that i still remember the theme song  you also now remember bug
repeatedly tried and failed to download the demo on my shitty internet
i would see ads for this and albert odyssey in gaming magazines all the time i was in rpg mania and wanted to play them so bad but i never ended up getting a saturn
how do you tend to play rpgs speech combative stealth good or bad
  for starters the only retro rpgs i play are jrpgs and your pic is a good example as to why fallout didnt become enjoyable until 3
on a first playthrough    whatever feels most natural
if a game allows it speech with a bit of combat thrown in most fights feel unnecessary but pacifism isnt something i think holds much water morally and i keep to my morality in games when i can given how little nuance there is in morality systems i suppose im good
    holy shit this is cringe
  theres not that many rpgs that let you do that particularly if we are talking about retro only
  ignoring the absolutely pathetic bait of a first post i like speech if the game doesnt have that option i go combat i dont think ive ever played a game stealthy outside of a stealth game
  stealth does not usually work well in rpgs in baldurs gate however stealth style play is awesome
make speech a super important stat  make charisma 100 useless  what the fuck did interplay mean by this
  tries to be be ironic  doesnt realize there are actually people who think this
  its a residue effect of gurps being basis for the game for most of development gurps lack charisma or any similar stats and instead all sort of social skills are related with intelligence or perception which is derived from iq anyway but can be levelled up separately  so when theyve dropped gurps and went for their own system they decided to throw in charisma because obviously all games need that stat to be the dump one but resolutions and dialogue options were still tied to old checks based on gurps hence why the speech skill and in are so fucking imporant in dialogues but ch is pretty much superflous especially in fo1      what gives you the impression he was ironic or trying to be
    i know this is hardly /vr/ but try underrail stealth build is not only viable but one of the most fun things to do
  what gives you the impression he was ironic or trying to be  sometimes hope is all we have
i just started playing fo1 for the first time today because xenogears erased my fucking save data after playing for 10 hours what am i in for
  how about you play the game and find out yourself
  cringe is a word for little kids talking about their parents or something any adult unironically using the word cringe like that is not fully functioning
  hes right though
  like a lot of rpg of that time pretty annoying to start but once you gain a few levels with some more skill points and better gear so you can survive things longer the game starts to get a lot better     honestly thats always been my one big issue with a lot of older rpg they tend to be great but only after dealing with a lot of annoying shit for the first hour or two since it all dealing with ac and to hit you are just missing 75 of the time until you gain enough levels to be able to hit more often or at least survive longer than 2 enemies
  t moron who cant make a functional character  there is literally no fucking way of being incompetent in fo1 unless you mean the optional rat stomping in the cave around vault 13 if you tag just about any combat skill and have ag of 6 or more by level 2 you have fully competent fighter because the tag multiplier is going to solve it for you
  you can have it at 7 tag small guns and still miss a good amount of your shots even near point blank at level 1 until you gain enough hp and gear to up you ac and skill points in the weapon of choice you are just relying on ian through most of the start of the game
  oh so you never played the game but read a meme about it  shady sands the very first place you will visit allows you to gain a level without any combat or fetching just by talking with few people and if you did your rat stomping diligently and came back to vault 13 asap for additional gear and exp you enter shady sands at level 2 and before any combat will be level 3  gee i wonder how hard it must be to hit things when your small guns is 91/111 truly impossible to hit anything
  ag is for action points you fucking retard and most weapons need 6 ap to perform aimed shot without a perk and ac is meaningless because well its fucking meaningless what you want is damage threshold and resistance but you wont see any real difference between ac 0 and 35 the maximum you can have unless fighting a literal fodder with duped skills
  and if you did your rat stomping diligently and came back to vault 13 asap  when you are right outside of the vault it wont let you  gee i wonder why no one bothered going right back to the vault the moment they were allowed to
   because its a fucking game and you are checking options you have at hand  alternatively you do what you were told  you march directly to vault 15 realise you cant enter it and either go to shady sands to check if they know whats up or go back to vault 13 to report progress so far or you eventually reach vault 15 after shady sands and then report back to vault 13 since you have nothing better to do now  but sure lets pretend its a hard game where you are powerless and weak and totally cant take on entire gang of khans by the moment you learn about their existence despite not even having anything resembling an optimal combat built sure mr fuckwit the game is just unbearingly tough and hard  if one is mentally challenged
  i just said it was annoying and yeah you can easily miss a 90 chance all i said was that at the start combat can be a bit rough and when you gain a level or 2 plus with ian its smooth sailing the rest of the game unless you get hit by a crit i never said its impossible or anything of the sort just that in many games of that time the start of a rpg is always the worse like how morrowind can fucking suck the first level or two
  thing is you dont see any combat until you are at least level 2 usually level 3 and if you are indifferent about tandi then you might not see any combat until some random encounter on your way to hub
  after i played tesbattlespire i have been unable to play a speech build in almost any game fallout i  ii were cool new vegas had its moments but mostly games since then have sucked at it    in battlespire the pc had the option to talk to literally every enemy he encountered with a full range of dialogue and multiple choice options for every enemy type it was a lot like the shitty intimidation perk hugely disappointing from fallout 4 except it actually worked if you made the right dialogue choices you could pacify or even turn enemies against their friends and even convince them to give you their loot if your speech was high enough you could learn things through dialogue with certain enemies that would later be useful in persuading others so it was worth it to chat with everyone even if you were going to chop their head off 2 seconds later named enemies had unique dialogue that could allow you to bypass certain areas in the game altogether or get unique equipment theres nothing quite like making a demon lose faith in whatever evil god he worships and watching him go kamikaze into his allies screaming about how his whole existence is a lie    unfortunately the rest of the game was kind of lacking and repetitive its one of those cases of welp the game failed overall so throw every last idea of it away and start over its really too bad
  faggot
  based yous farmer
speech because i feel like dialogue can be the most interesting part of an rpg stealth after that because its one of the few genres that allows it
  how do you tend to play rpgs speech combative stealth  stealth  good or bad  whatever keeps me alive and progressing better    hammer on your trollling skills fag
in junktown  want to set up gizmo and plant bug  accidentally talk to him instead of going into his inventory  he had already warned me  oh fuck hes trying to kill me better load  accidentally hit quick save instead of quick load  now cant set up gizmo or kill killian for reward  fuck my entire game up  what the fuck should i do now i just left town instead of committing to anything i figure maybe i can just stay away from gizmos and still trade with killian if i dont get banned
  for future use
  thanks
  just shoot the fat asshole you idiot how fucking hard it is to figure out oh wait you just made that all up my bad for giving you you
  i always start with stealth up until the game makes it perfectly clear that it sucks completely and everything else is infinitely better then restart as speech unless that sucked too then combat
  fair enough its just my first playthrough and i didnt want to get banned from the first town i came across
random generate as much as i can   sometimes you get really shitty characters sometimes you roll fucking rambo dont usually care for rp unless its a whim and i do permadeath runs 90 of the time if the game is doable that way that is    otherwise i selfrestrict saving to saving only on rest or something similar its not for being hardcore i think i ruined too many games in the past with cheese and then i found nethack so
alright so i downloaded mednafen to play guardian heroes among other saturn games but i cant find the bin/cue for it anyone know where i can find saturn bios that are already dumped
its really difficult to sift through the thousands of crappy games that image with the zniggys quest is definitely applicable    ninja gaiden on gameboy just got a really nice zx spectrum port done by the same people who ported mighty final fight it plays pretty well too        but is there more worth playing that isnt just 8bit jap game ports
castlevania spectral interlude well thats a jap fan game and not a port that recent power blade port looks fucking sweet too  my spectrum is waiting for me at the apartment lobby front desk with that a solid rgb cable and my flash cart im ready for some fun

is there a gbc emulator without ads for android    i dont mind playing with my phone in public but ads like milfs waiting for you and click here to get bigger are kinda embarassing     i already wasted 4 hours playing pokemon and if possible i want an emulator that can transfer save files
an emulator with ads what the fuck lmao
  not wanting a bigger pecker   not wanting horny milfs hungry for said enlarged penis pulling you away from your old chilrens games  wew

  lel
  i use retroarch and mgba on it with no complaints so far but if you went 4 hours into a crap emulator with ads before realizing there might be better alternatives it might be too complex for you i mean seriously you could have googled it first and found a million better answers before going so deep
  just find one thats paid for and then type the full name of the app into google and add apk at the end of the search    4shared used to be goat for this stuff but idk these days
  such is the fate of a mobilecuck on top of having the most godawful shit controls

2nd impact  3rd strike  music and presentation wise
its another thread where /vr/ pretends to know shit about fighting games
  weird because op was speaking about the aesthetics
  did you even read the post  well i agree with op  3rd strike has the better gameplay but 2nd impact has the better art
  so you really cemented the fact that you know shit about fighting games not music and background games with gameplay on it you zoomer child
  no youre not allowed to talk aesthetic and music gameplay only  seething

i really dont like the 3d prerendered designs sf3 went for with its stages    by no means is it unplayable  i just hate that it mixes pixel art stages and prerendered    also the beatthetruck minigame looks like absolute shit
  definitely                  
  i really dont like the 3d prerendered designs sf3 went for with its stages  also the beatthetruck minigame looks like absolute shit  the suv is the only prerendered 3d element in the game as far as i can remember what backgrounds are you referring to other than that bonus stage
ill say in regards to music  arranged 3s  2i  3s  3soe
i never liked a single sf3 game i went from sf2 to sfa3 to cvs2 to kofxi to sf4

what palettes do you guys recommend for the nes rgb mod
  wavebeam is my favorite good balance between authenticity and being aesthetically pleasing
  any idea how it looks on a pvm
  no but since it was developed primarily with crts in mind its probably pretty good
  thanks
    disgusting zoomer posts we know you dont care about presentation and have 1gb of roms on your android phone with all your emulators some of us care about representing the artists intent accurately
  its funny how you find some kid enjoying old video games on his phone more pathetic than a bunch of old retards obsessing over the smb sky for threads upon threads on a taiwanese olympic skiing enthusiast forum
i dont have enough time left in my life to recreate your specific childhood experience of smb ill play it however the fuck i want ill play it on a retron 5 hooked up to an 240hz lcd stretched to 169 with motion smoothing ill play it on a ds with nearest neighbor scaling and 3x frameskip ill change the palette myself so every single color is a shade of shrek green and il still have more fun with it than you because im playing video games and youre obsessively tweaking the graphics so that the sky is the right shade of mauve
  whats the frame of reference here why would the sky be purple instead of you know the actual color of the sky irl
imagine being this autistic
  wavebeam gets my vote
  its ok to be wrong
  video games are not real life its a crude abstract imitation at best the sky is also not one shade of any color
  sure butits the sky my point is what makes you think its supposed to be purple when its most likely blue
  friendly reminder that caring this much about the colors on an 8 bit video game console is the definition of aspergers
  shigeru miyamoto
  uhh interesting but the purpleness was only a compromise he wanted blue so if anything the offcolor versions are actually more accurate to dev intentions
  how could you possibly interperet it that way it literally says the opposite
  he wanted the game to be about characters running around under a blue sky the nes has a limited palette so he probably only went with the purpleish color because it best represented that
  does anyone remember this thread from years ago where people posted interviews with miyamoto and tens of photos of old magazines and videos playing on initial hardware the argument ended when it was proven the blue one with a purplish tint is the proper color    dejavu much i just cant believe that not allowing 6th gen means we have to have threads pruned to have this discussion every few months    seriously this is a thread on reddit from a year ago too same pictures and posts by people here
  enjoy your ugly accurate colors im sure miyamoto himself will knock on your door any minute now to thank you for respecting his artistic vision
  did you read the quote my dude
  the sky was intentionally purple  citation needed
  
  cant read between the lines  must adhere to the intentions of some 60 year old gook to enjoy a 30 year old game  do you have autism my dude if i played the game with a palette that makes the sky deep blue would you have a stroke
  yes unlike you i actually did he wanted a blue sky but with the ness limited palette a purple shade was the closest to what he had in mind he literally didnt intend for the sky to be purple it was just the best alternative
  but i heard miyamoto shows up to your house and gives you a gold star if you make the sky as purple as barney the dinosaur dont you want to be rewarded for respecting the artists vision
  seething
  go back to asp ya simp
  couldnt you just check what it looks like on a pal console
  pal is irrelevant to everything
  no need for that theres a version of the ppu that outputs rgb directly and definitively yet for some reason that hasnt ended the debate
  this is probably actually the most accurate has a purpleish sky without the weird drab poop brown for the sign/ground
  imagine being so autistic that you care more about the color of the fucking ingame sky than actually playing the game
  its ugly though
  its pretty garish and obviously wrong for some games but i think for a lot of games its actually a nice looking palette
  imagine being such a virgin you get asshurt over a spec of dust interfering with the rgb output or some shit
  video games are art  spotted the boomer
  but youll write a blog about it
  il still have more fun with it than you because im playing video games and youre obsessively tweaking the graphics so that the sky is the right shade of mauve  if that doesnt sound remotely fun to you then youre not autistic enough for /vr/  go back home
  a blog  t brainlet
  be japanese engineer  developing hardware exclusively for japanese market  people on the internet 35 years later think its bad that you developed it for the japanese television standard
  he doesnt spend an hour trying various methods of monitor calibration and compare the results
  
  the purple is actually closer to blue and the blue is more of a cyan
  it took me a while to decide which one i would use and eventually i picked the purplish one    i think you might be a retard
  its ok to be wrong  no its also not ok to underage post
  it took him a while to decide because he didnt intend for the sky to be purple it was a compromise because of palette limitations no idea why this is so hard for you to understand
  you get a gold star anon you get all the gold stars
  this is my favorite /vr/ meme
  the ntsc lumachroma system was cheaper to use otherwise the nes had to bump up its pallet ram to not only run in rgb but the ppu would of also been at 44 pins as well the extra pins are red green blue and sync to be exact    yamauchi wanted a cheap system if it was set for 200 instead of 150 it would of been rgb instead plus more ram and removable controllers
early crt colors were weird  pic related is nextstep one of the forst color guis  the bg is called blue and on crt and ips it looks dark blue but on oled and lcd it looks purple
  it is blue its just low saturation
    heres what it would look like if it was purple
  with the nes limited palette  no he had 3 choices for blue sky color and he picked the purplish one  read better   i picked the purplish one i felt that purple had the depth of nature i was really into that    it was a deliberated choice not a default choice because there werent a more realistic sky blue color in nes palette hint there is one
  what do you expect its a nes game
  you should go back to school purplish literally implies blue but a hint of purple
  absolutely savage gave me a chuckle
  yeah the nameless overworked rightoutofcollege nip graphics designer who probably worked on two more games before leaving the industry really had some artistic intent making these childrens games for minimum wage
  friendly reminder that youre a stupid nigger and miyamoto himself says the skies are blue      130ish
  that be some hardcore trolling right there if you think for one second that this might be true i recommend you consider kys
  t someone who doesnt know anything about the famicomera dev cycle or thinks everyone there was like miyamoto
  im going with nestopia yuv then

  lol faggot

  ftfy faggot
  nice fix
  500 hours in ms paint
  this is actually pretty funny
  what did he mean by this
  wtf are these letters
        makes sense the purple hue is closer to summer sky color
  purple hue  it is like 98 blue with 2 red
  the sky is typically more purplish in summer than winter which is why i think he made a good choice given the options to him at the time since it gives a nice feeling to the game thats all
    i dont know about your ntsc sky in america but here summer sky is fucking blue
  warmer air tends to hold more moisture which in turn scatters more light why the sky is blue in the first place making it shift slightly to the violet end of the spectrum if you live far enough from the equator that you have distinct summer and winter months you can actually measure it on clear days
everyone knows that purpleblue is cooler than cyan/light blue which is gay
    based and blueskypilled
  but with the ness limited palette  lets take a look at that palette pic related now of those colors are you suggesting that there wasnt a more blue sky alternative to choose than a shade of purple to be fair only three of these colors can be active on a tile or a sprite at any given time but thats beside the point
  there is no original one the nes palette doesnt use defined rgb values like most other consoles so different devices will display the colors in different ways im just going to assume that the top 6 are from different composite capture devices and/or fanmade emulator color palettes
im pretty sure the sky is supposed to be clear the hue of blue is a perception of the rays on your eyes
  mario maker on wii u puts this to rest  its the 9th
  yes i am the blue shades next to the purpley one they went with arent quite bright enough to look natural and the cyan colors are too ugly and garish
  your point i never denied thats what the color looks like
top ten most autistic /vr/ threads 2018 edition
  kid this aint even the most autistic nes palette argument weve had this year

    just some dude named miyamoto who already had years of experience at the height of videogames and is the most famous person in the history of videogames there is a quote in this thread even stating it if you bothered to read it you literally mentally disabled spastics

  smb deluxe and mario maker make the purple sky noncanon get over it simp
rgb output from the nes classic is how the game is supposed to look
  whoa now careful with that hot take
miyamoto sakurai et al made great contributions to gaming but they wouldnt give two fucks about this shit
  mmm that kino diarrhea hue on the sign and ground is exactly what based shigiro miyamo intended
  uneven pixels and incorrect aspect ratio nice job nintendo
  4 colors for tiles and 3 for sprites but a character or an object can be assembled from multiple sprites to overcome this for example megaman
  muh graphics  i hate casuals
  yes shimmering sound latency and noise ridden hdmi output is definitely reference material for the game looked because just like the nes virtual console showed us nintendo knows precisely how their old games should look
  have ever heard the term grasping at straws thats you
  uneven pixels care to explain in this image the pixels are 11 and i dare you to challenge me you
the real color is the one which comes out from the television when you connect the console unit to it with any of the supported cables its that simple i find it scary that new people dont care about the visual accuracy and also i see often people using 2xwaifu or some other weird scaler on top of this the amount of ignorants is huge and i lost my sleep because of it please send me help and start caring about the games these games are culture and we must preserve them the best way we can preserving means also playing them the way the creators originally wanted and meant  but given that most new people dont even understand what emulation is and have trouble running even the most simple of emulators they need to go and post is my machine powerful enough for zerda botw how do i set up emulator x without ever trying to figure out anything on their own is testament to their neverending stupidity and lack of honor and backbone after i die gaming will die with me and few others imagine miyamoto dying imagine how big and sad event that will be imagine world after he is gone gaming will crumble and fade away and all what is left is bunch of ignorant kids with their phones
  pfff as if mario odyssey wasnt just an elaborate phone game anyway miyamoto if anything is part of this modern microtransactionbased gaming culture
  i guess he has caved in i believe when the other guy died i dont dare to say his name any more he drowned his sorrow in local soaplands and went to yakuza owned secret brothels hes now an empty husk and does anything to prolong his life  well i just booted god hand on pcsx2 and i will drown my sorrows as well god bless you and everyone on this thread
  i felt that purple had the depth of nature

why the fuck does namco give this game no love ms pacman was also made by firthy gaijin but it got featured in a ton of namco museums jr got jack shit but its a fun game with cute cutscenes maybe not as good as ms but still pretty cool
because the pinball table is difficult to emulate how the fuck are they supposed to remake it
  youre thinking of baby pacman  jr is the one with the big mazes
  apparently they intended to twice  once in a japaneseonly pc compilation and again in a pluginplay where there were still some leftover assets  my guess is behindthescenes legal bullshit that they cared enough to sort out for ms pacman since its much more popular but not this game  im still just as upset as you are
i liked panzer general a lot so i wonder if these games are any good what do you think about them
the only ones that interest me are the moe moe niji series
which version is better the n64 or the xbox version do you also think the game is worth the 100 asking price on n64  i ask this because this is a game i have wanted to try for a while and since im a physical fag i dont wanna emulate it not like it runs well anyway so i would be buying it and dont wanna pop 100 on a game i think would just be eh i know the xbox version has censorship but does it have any other problems i assume it runs better
  n64 is way better and still looks and runs great  just pretend is a 60 modern day game with a 40 dlc only it will actually keeps its value and not be replaced by a new version in a few months
n64 has much better mp mode and varaity    also its not as censored as the xbox
  just buy a flash cart if youre going to spend that much
    i could have sworn the xbox version had more modes  anyway n64 it is
n64 version runs at single digit framerates has awkward controls and tedious game play the xbox version does a lot to fix this up with the only downside being songs about poopy are censored the humor in bad fur day definitely didnt last well into adulthood and the xbox version just basically just a better game
  n64 version runs at single digit framerates
played both i liked the xbox version more for controller alone
  op you can find a copy for 4555 on ebay just look around i got a n64 with 9 games including conker for 110 on ebay just 2 months ago
  rare replay has the n64 version physically for cheap but i heavily doubt you have an xbone or would want one
  not like it runs well anyway  the legit version also runs like shit anyway the n64 couldnt handle it
  thats an indoor scene  i know moving goalposts but a single room has less to render than an outdoor area
xbox version runs better controls better looks great and tries to iron out some of the issues the original had gameplay in conker is generally lackluster though at least when it comes to single player
xbox version is way better unless youre an autist who insists on older  better every fucking time
  n64 version has better art style it also has better animation the xbox version regressed the lip sync it also has the full game while the xbox version removed some minor parts of it and also censored stuff the xbox version also added stupid time wasting enemies to a few parts which add no value negative value really to the game    also the xbox version has trash multiplayer for local play at least while n64 local multi is goat
  its hardly a rock solid 30 fps but singledigit please
  t bought the n64 version for 100
  whatever is readily available to you the xbox version is fine but inferior to the n64 version a number of ways strangely even though the xbox was the big boy console and the n64 was the kiddie console the n64 version is more naughty where the xbox version goes as far as bleeping out curse words that were fully voice acted on the n64 secondly its kind of great to see this game run on an actual n64 just to admire the technical aspects of it some moments will surprise you that a nonexpansion pak game can look that good although the game suffers from the slowdown that plagued most n64 games    however if you are going as far as to drop 100 bones on this game you might as well get a everdrive64 and be done with it the price you would pay is similar to conkers bfd and you get the added bonus of being able to play every other n64 game including games from outside your region trust me the earlier you get over the must own the real copy feeling the more games youll experience and enjoy  the feeling of playing a great game is infinitely better than the feeling of owning a legitimate copy of a hidden gem
  dude just emulate lmao  fuck off youre not welcome on this board
  the electrons that travel through the authentic cart travel in the exact same was as the ones from a flashdrive so who are you to say its not an authentic experience when its indistinguishable from the original  im a proponent of playing on original hardware and if you knew anything about the n64 you would know that all the processing is done by the console itself the cartridges have no special chips and dont do anything but feed the console the game data
  thats a flash cart not an emulator you fucking retard its played on the authentic hardware
  flash cart  authentic hardware  
  if you knew anything about the n64 you would know that all the processing is done by the console itself the cartridges have no special chips and dont do anything but feed the console the game data  the interesting thing is that supposedly the n64s microcode setup was designed to be a softwarebased replacement for the sness enhancement chips    so instead of actual chips boosting the hardware the microcode system allows the gpu to get a boost in power through updating its lowlevel software almost like a driver update this is why nintendo was gatekeeping the microcode shit so much because they did the same with snes enhancement chips to keep third parties under their thumb    but the based thing of course is that because its just software it makes things super easy for flash cartridges just load in the game rom and the n64s gpu automatically gets its update
  lol i trole u
  its not a big problem to just buy the games you want to play on the n64 theres only like 5 of them anyway
  so it wasnt a problem with my old pc that couldnt handle emulation though i could emulate sm64 both zeldas and banjokazooie just fine
  thats not an emulator also fuck you emulate whatever you want you elitist dick
  flash carts are not emulators retard
  thats bullshit the microcode is just code for programming the rsp it has nothing to do with enhancement chips and is not like them any more than ram is like them
  the microcode is just code for programming the rsp it has nothing to do with enhancement chips  yes its just software but the whole idea of it was so that system performance could be increased over time through lowlevel optimization it was designed to work as a cheaper alternative to the enhancement chips    nintendo didnt withhold microcode documentation from developers just because they were being assholes for no reason they were deliberately trying to be gatekeepers of enhanced n64 performance
til bad fur day is on xbox ᕕ  ᗜ  ᕗ
  ok but its like you cant download a graphics card you can get low level optimization anyway and put enhancement chips on top of that so i am not sure why it should be one or the other do you have any good source stating it worked as a software alternative to enhancement chips
  you can get low level optimization anyway  no you dont for example the ps1s equivalent to rsp the geometry transformation engine gte cant be lowlevel optimized because all of its functions are already baked into the hardware    do you have any good source stating it worked as a software alternative to enhancement chips  obviously nintendo never said it outright but its pretty clear if you read between the lines of what n64 developers said in interviews
  actually scratch that i do actually remember nintendo saying outright somewhere that microcode system was there to deliver upgraded performance over the systems life but i cant remember where some old magazine
  op you can find a copy for 4555 on ebay just look around  hello time traveller are you sure those arent repros
    yeah i think you have very little understanding or knowledge about what youre saying and you are wrong and spreading misinformation obviously the microcode is there to deliver upgraded performance that doesnt make it like drivers or enhancement chips etc
  runs great  sub 10fps is not great in fact the original game runs like total ass garbage
  obviously the microcode is there to deliver upgraded performance that doesnt make it like drivers  then what is it like you fucking moron    you know programming microcode isnt like equivalent to just clever use of gte on ps1 right its actually lowerlevel than that and most definitely comparable to drivers although different because drivers are there for interfacing between devices and operating system
  conker actually runs at 1 fps heeheheheheheheheheh     its fun to just make stuff up xd
  xbox has one mode they cut out all the fun stuff from n64 for a team fortress clone
  fucking idiot
  you can emulate the n64 version i did a complete playthough years ago  both versions of cbfd are on xbone now so its easy to get these titles and no longer rare    n64  better multiplayer  less censored  better text boxes    xbox  better singleplayer campaign due to tweaks  better/different graphics
  absolutely just go look here nov 21 30    
  neither version is worth playing unless you are/have the sense of humor of a 9 year old
  that doesnt make it like drivers or enhancement chips  microcode is literally used exactly for the purpose of letting a part change its operation to function as another part its bad enough youre too lazy and retarded to just read a bit of a wikipedia page but do you really need to shitpost here bragging about your ignorance
  see  
if there was a patch to remove the god damn censors for the xbox version that one would be better
sometimes i totally forget that it had a remake probably because it only happened one console generation removed from the original i remember hearing good things at the time and i like the art style even though i only had n64 mplayer isnt really a factor anymore unless you seriously have some real life friends that are into it at this point
  he thinks the writing is the only reason anyone would play it  go home zoomie
the remake might have better controls and some tweaks to the main game but it doesnt have the same charm of bfd at all  while the graphics are amazing the main deal of conker was to look like a cutesy 3d platformer so the characters doing raunchy shit was more shocking and lr looks too gritty and realistic to keep that intention some of the new jokes dont even work like the one at the beginning where the gargoyle doesnt fall and the bleeps which the conker team added because they thought it would make the jokes funnier dont work  also mp in lr is great but the one in bfd is more varied and is way more fun to play with people
  n64 but neither are worth buying  rather than buy this for 100 get an everdrive 64 and download the rom
  its hardly a rock solid 30 fps  rock solid 30 fps  nigger64 owners defending this dogshit as usual    this but unironically
  youre in luck then because there is
  note to brown people dont take a picture of your hand if youre trying to sell a video game
  do you have a link anon i couldnt find it on google
  hardware implies the actual game system and its controllers the game cart is considered software so saying that you are playing on authentic hardware is 100 true saying you are playing on 100 authentic hardware and software is not
  the data saved on the game cart is software the game cart itself is hardware
  100 is cheap ive seen if cor 250 up here i think just the cart is less but i dont buy games in bad condition they have to include the case or box lucky i bought back in 2006 for 20 at zellers
  nintendo never published the everdrive retard
  or is there
  does xbox mp even work anymore now that xbl was shut down
  this is the reason ive heavily considered getting the n64 everdrive there arent many games worth playing on n64 but for the games that are they arent very cheap    dd support is cool as well i suppose

quick  favorite setting/chapter  favorite protagonist  favorite odio  also which chapter has the best ending and why is it akiras
  favorite setting/chapter  akira also the chapter with the best music  favorite protagonist  akira  favorite odio  oboros ode iou    i really loved the tense atmosphere in cubes chapter but akiras was a lot more rpgheavy so it takes the cake for me not counting the final chapter of course
  the premise of the game seems bretty good but just how grindy is the gameplay i just finished the first saga game on gameboy and honestly the grind in that game was enough for the next decade
  it has no grinding  out of the 7 main chapters i think you can only grind in 2 but you dont even need to do that unless you want to fight some secret bosses
  excellent looks like i found my next vidya
ive had the rom for awhile but never got around to playing itit was actually mentioned along with a bunch of other games in an article about fan translations in like a gamepro or some other magazine
  the grind in that game was enough for the next decade  thats weird did you run a party of humans only or something
  the one that requires grinding is the damn ninja chapter if you want to fight the bonuses bosses the ninja chapter is easily the most frustrating section to get through without a guide
  pogo  pogo  dinosaur odio  
  yeah ninja chapter is easy to get lost in i came very close to beating the ninja chapter with no kills my first playthrough with no guide then i spent hours trying to figure out how to finish it without killing the final guards turns out i broke the roboninja and you need it to get past them so id say people should play through it normally on their first time especially if theyre not using a guide it can still be a bit confusing but they wont end up wandering for hours like me my second favorite chapter though overall i love all the secrets
  yeah i ran a party of only humans since i did a couple of runs and honestly didnt lack the other races lack of inventory space  on the bright side the grind does pay off and i was a demigod in the end killing the big boss
  didnt like

  been years since i played this  favorite setting/chapter  definitely ninja super satisfying getting through it with no kills  favorite protagonist  sundown kid that entire chapter is also very unique  favorite odio  probably od10
tfw space chapter actually spooked the fuck out of me
favorite setting/chapter  sundown the whole thing felt like one really smooth elegant experience  favorite protagonist  xin shan quan master had the most interesting personal arc  favorite odio  0d10 was coolest and really gave off the incarnation of hatred vibe a lot better than the other ones
  favorite setting/chapter  on my playthrough i liked the modern day fighting chapter as it was fun figuring out each boss but i imagine the feudal japan chapter has the most replayability i did also like the final chapter it was cool how it felt like you were playing a clusterfuck of a game with all the inconsistent enimies  favorite protagonist  cube his design is cute and lin shes the best party member overall  favorite odio  orested of course the last battle was pretty cool    live a live is a pretty interesting concept but it is a idea that really does not work well when considering replayability chapters like the science fiction one and the wild west one are amusing the first time but once you know what to expect it just doesnt feel much fun to play through
  games only flaw is literally that its too easy were you playing a messed up rom or something
    some of squares best sprite work
  i remember one of the bosses taking like 10 minutes to chip away at their health in the ninja chapter only to level up immediately afterward and learn a skill that would have completely trivialized it one of my biggest problems with the game is how wonky the damage progression is
  i must have been because in that ninja scenario there was a battle where you fight a boss and about half a dozen or so of his minions every minion could one shot me alone not including the actual boss himself i gave up on the game
  one of my biggest problems with the game is how wonky the damage progression is  yeah its really poorly designed
  there are two scenarios that will completely fuck you over if youre too lowlevel the ninja and kung fu chapter unfortunately they happen to the first two scenarios on the list the rest of the game is comparatively very easy although the street fighter chapter can be a pain if youre trying to learn all the moves
  youre supposed to have to use the robot to beat the fish anon theres an order in which you can beat the bosses to level up more in the ninja chapter and finding out how to do the puzzle and have the most strength for the final chapter is the point of it this is like how you can spend the whole cowboy chapter drinking with the bartender and getting backstory and fight all the guys alone for more exp
  he really did nothing wrong  fuck straybow
i played through livealive just using a guide all the way and had a blast    so thats a viable option
  i dont know cubes has this really great survival horror setting layered on top of a real tragic story pogos is just fun all around and gives me saturday morning cartoon vibes kungfu masters is a little mediocre but the whiplash halfway through really makes you want to see it all the way through and of course oersteds chapter just gave me one of the most empty feelings ive ever gotten from a games ending and i loved how well the sprite work looked for the setting fuck straybow    i loved them all the psychics was a little mediocre compared to the rest despite the fun gimmick though and the wrestling guys chapter i can barely remember theyre definitely not bad but if you play them after a particularly good chapter then they really feel like step downs
favs robot for atmosphere and ninja for gameplay
accidentally killed myself on the space chapter  holy fuck i spooked myself
  the exact thing he did wrong was mistreating violence as though it were a virtue or something to take pride in he should have used his strength to protect people and thats it which means he should have never taken part in the contest if he knew he would win he should have helped whoever won it instead as an ally he wanted to be better than other people and be a hero so he would be loved by them this is fundamentally a path that always leads toward destruction because it displaces and manipulates others driving them off their own path and leaving them with resentment instead he should have been trying to find a way to express his own love for other people without forcing or coercing them through the circumstances    pride is a sin because you should never feel good because of how you compare to anyone else you should instead be working to make your happiness coincide with that of others if your life doesnt coincide with the lives of those around you then you will always be fighting until you are destroyed by them    straybow is a monster but oersted created that monster he was happy that he was better than everybody else and in so doing he was gaining pleasure from others suffering    violence only begat more and more violence until it escalated to the point of destruction it was never going to do anything but escalate because that is the only thing that can happen when violence is met with violence the only way such a cycle ends is with extinction and thats exactly what happens in the game once oersted is deprived of all love he only kills until he is killed and if he isnt killed then he simply kills everything and everyone that lives    sjws only incite more crimes democrats and republicans only drive each other towards more heinous and unfair tactics as they spout vitriol at eachother feminists and misogynists only dig the gulf between sexes deeper and invite crimes against their own kind in response to their demonizing the other side
i liked how in the final chapter some characters would be easier or harder to get depending on whos leading the party for example if you have the cowboy or the robot as the leader masaru will sorta recognize what they are and join them promptly however if you go with anyone else he must be fought first pogo only joins promptly if you bring lei and so on    same thing when you recruit cube you need to get an item to reactivate cube depending on the leader the character will describe the items as best as they can pogo is  sundown/oboro/lei recognize it as iron box akira knows its a battery and masaru just says mehcanical parts
explain that scene where the old man goes off screen with a little girl in the kungfu chapter what the fuck is going on there and why is it in the game
  iirc its a teenage girl and shes showing him her succulent peach
  a succulent chinese peach
  le epic enlightened centrist
  i wasnt talking about the fish i was talking about the weird cat demon thing
didnt straybow just get influenced by the demon statue or whatever the game implies that from his monologue near the end or maybe im just misunderstanding    oersted even says that as long as theres hate in the world the demon king will return which supports that straybow was like a protoodio 
this game has serious balance issues as some have already pointed out  if youre just a level or 2 below the recommended window you will get wiped out in one hit even at full health and yet if youre just a couple of levels higher than that the battles become trivial  the maps are also really tiny and have you just backtracking backwards and forwards across them repeatedly doing slightly different tasks  the concept of this game is fantastic but its execution is full of problems
  nah straybow was fully conscious of his decision as he had planned it out and in the final chapter if you find his ghost you can talk to it and hell say he regrets his actions
  just spam statdropping attacks if youre at a level disadvantage theyre all overpowered and every character has at least one
what i like the most about this game is how the boss theme fits perfectly for all of them even though theyre completely different
    so just was odio the manifest of oersteds pain
i want to buy this game mostly for battletoads how is the input lag
i dont know but based on the quality and amount of time it looks like went into the game i would take the gamble you screen will probably be more of a factor for lag
i have this its fine and the plus side is youll 29 games that are a fuckton better than battletoads
  somebodys mad about the speeder bikes
  its not worth buying but it is worth playing  keep one friend around who was stupid enough to buy an xbox 1 and this game and just hang out with him when you want to play battletoads    the rewind feature is better than save states but still shit whats tragic is this is somehow one of the best games on the bone and all it is is old rare games
its times like these that make me want to move out of my parents house and have some money to spare
  you think you have it rough heres some deals near me why must i be broke
i feel like when youre paying hundreds of dollars for something you can emulate just fine its part peacocking anyway guess what you cant peacock when youre broke have a little sense
  i can emulate police trainer but it isnt the same as using an actual lightgun and you really cant emulate silent scope properly since being able to look down the scope while keeping your other eye on the area is part of the game
  how does this work if you move out you gonna have to pay for rent and food etc you gonna have even less money to spend on toys
  get some of the arcade1up cabinets in stores now instead theyre relatively compact lightweight  inexpensive
  do they have any major downside except for how short they are
you guys need to visit /biz/
  i cant find any with reasonable pricing available in europe and none of the us sellers ship to my country
  well the sound is set to stereo on super street fighter ii and ssffii turbo despite it having mono output so sounds coming from the left are sometimes absent champion edition is fine though the rampage ones have board replacements due to a glitch in gauntlet the dial on tempest is a bit stiff without putting in an extra washer and the paint on the control decks can rub off with too much use if you dont send away for the free overlays but theyre easy to gut and put a raspberry pi into so they can play any game you want    yes we havent gotten the galaga one here in canada
  this is how peasants stay peasants    a prince inherits the crown a peasant gets kicked out of the nest to be independent imagine if a princess got told to learn how to make your own kingdom
  the feeling will pass as soon as you have to pay for anything the first time ever in your life
i find it hard to imagine how youd be struggling financially if you worked and lived with anyone who was helping you family or otherwise      stop buying bullshit and save your money or find a job      350 euro
  dude that roadblasters thats a damn good deal sucks for you anon
where would you start to untangle this
first post
just start with any plug and trace it back from there once i have that device separated out id move onto another far too many times ive been the one to untangle the controllers of others
  this i just gently tug cords until shit comes undone that pile would take me like 3 minutes tops
id start with any controllers
  is that an n64dd
  oh false alarm its gay as hell 3do
  unplug everything from the power source and consoles pull it all out into the middle of the floor seperate the chunks that you can without untangling and then find the end of any cord and begin to untangle
  same start with controllers then get whichever thing looks easiest
also take the wires with the smallest ends first eg the tips of controllers and pull them through all the wires until they become completely free     the ancient manly art of untangling wires
  post the rest of the room
  yeah that looks pretty complicated get whoever ties your shoes for you to help
you want to work from the outsidein so find the stuff where you can easily track most of the cord and go from there
  first step is to unplug everything from the consoles next is pull one one thing until it stops see where the knot is untangle it and continue
  the ancient manly art of untangling wires      the ancient and manly way to untangle wires is a little different than that  
  fpbp
oh thats easy id get out the old dremel and start cutting away until every controller is free
i used to be this kind of person but you wouldnt know it based on how organized i am now     to start i would just pull the whole wad out and start pulling it apart little by little look for distinctly colored wires and snake them out first which should get you off to a good start     i use a very similar system to pic related but i use a mail organizer and stack them vertically for wires that are too thicc to fit i bought a spool of twisty wire and bind each one in a big loop and store them in a plastic drawer    the key isnt to get organized in the first place its to stay organized by creating a work flow i keep an inbox in my workshop where i throw stuff im too busy to take care of right now and then sort it at the end of the month or week
ruins your cord  nothin personnel child
  right above the nes there thats what my instincts tell me
  somewhere in the world an extraordinarily rich person is paying top dollar for someone to untangle pic related
  somewhere in the world your wife is having sex and its not with you
  what kind of sadistic fuck wraps their controllers this tight and neatly
  this is some sm type shit
  is that controller here to fulfill my deep dark fantasies
  what is the best way to wrap the controller cord
  tie the cord up like pic related but use a velcro band
how are wild arms 1  2 i played them both for a few hours when i was a kid but something about them turned me off and made me never want to continue i think it was the transition from 2d sprites to hideous 3d models in battle anyway im running out of old jrpgs to play and im willing to give them a shot
theyre really not that good pretty unremarkable except in its setting which still isnt enough to warrant playing them    im sure youre not running out of jrpgs though what are some of your favorites maybe the boyz of /vr/ can hook you up
  i loved the 3d models in battle as for the game its ok a bit bland wild arms 1 came out at a time when suikoden was the only real rpg on the playstation with any kind of fame just before the ffvii explosion happened this and suikoden were really the only way for a lot of ps players to get their rpg fix for a while
  theyre really not that good pretty unremarkable  thats what i assumed all these years i was looking for something to keep me busy while i wait for the grandia remasters and it was either these or koudelka i also want to start the phantasy star games at some point but i dont have the motivation right now there arent too many old jrpg games i can think of that i havent already played but i played through all the saga games a couple years ago and since then its been hard to find games that arent a disappointment compared to them    i remember the first time i played it was right after watching my friend play ffvii at his house my mom couldnt afford to get me a new game so i had to settle for renting wild arms it was a huge disappointment
  wa1 is best described as slow and cute with a weird amount of story similiarities to ff7 i probably wouldnt recommend it to someone     wa2 is one of the unsung greats though fresh tropes unique character mechanics multiple environment interaction mechanics per character both secret characters and mechanics to unlock for a fantastic amount of sidecontent lavosbucket type superbosses     the games have no relation either so you can jump into wa2 right away
i completed the first game recently i thought it was bogstandard but it actually ended up charming me by the end i couldnt tell you why tho     i tried wa2 recently but i got discouraged after reading that the translation was worse than the first game
under its average appearance wa1 is fucking great there are lots of surprises upsets mistakes characters have flaws but they grow stronger relations are well done without relying on some tired clichés not too much at least npcs are likable and you might become attached to some despite some rough beginings there are a metric ton of optional quests that reward smart play  oh and yeah intros yes there are 2 intros and soundtrack are fucking fantastic even more if you have the western spaghetti vibe
  i like wild arms it just feels like a classic jrpg in all the right ways  i also smoked a lot of weed while playing it and gave all the spells names that made me giggle    never really gave 2 much of a chance though
theyre fine but honestly the nonretro entries of 3 and 5 are better
  haha i really need to dive into post snes saga myself but i could see how this would cause you to be let down by jrpgs since then id recommend playing some wrpg or older pc rpgs if you wanna change it up in a genre you seem pretty tired/tapped out of
1 is great the games get progressively worse they never got the message that what made wa great was the sparse use of arms and western stuff
  wa1 is best described as slow and cute with a weird amount of story similiarities to ff7  explain    also wa1 is great how dare you
  also cecilia is a great female mc if a little mary sueish
  3 is my favorite precisely because its the most western setting and everyone uses a gun
  she makes crucial mistakes so i cant put her in the mary sue case  the hair event and her dialog at that time really made me awe at how such small and simple things could do for a character
  3 sucks its basically anime cod
  that is a terribly inaccurate comparison
op here ive decided to go ahead and play them this is now a wild arms thread
what is this thread wild arms 1 is great fuck you all
  watch the 2nd intro it has a lot if crucial info
that fucking intro is great  
id consider wild arms to be as good as earthbound if only because theres pretty much no other jrpg like it
  i guess the main sticking point i remember is her convincing the giant robot to help them that seemed somewhat unrelated to her character but she was given that role    but it once again reinforces the idea that she is undoubtedly the main character of wa1
  pretty sure 2/3 of the thread is praising wild arms bruv
  horrid translations
  it should be 3/3 fuck you all
  cant argue that the inbattle graphics are pretty shit
  mc discovers hes labmade and completely shuts down forcing the female mc to enter his psyche and pull him out     badguy is obsessed with alien creature he calls mother ends up fusing together with her to form the final boss     also natures selfdefense weapons are roaming the worldmap as optional bosses and at some point you go into space both games also mixes swords guns and magic into one setting     and wa1 was released the month before ff7 btw
i wish acf wasnt such a lame remake of 1
michiko naruke is my favorite video game composer ever shes got such a grandiose sweeping style whenever a new smash game is announced these days i get more hyped to see which tracks she contributes than the actual game she almost singlehandedly carries the wild arms series thorough the music
  how is it great though
  this picture is the only thing i even remember about wild arms
  still one of my favourite video game intros of all time  
  i wonder how many tracks she did for pic related
i still dont know how youre supposed to pronounce elw
  thanks for the spoiler asshole now i dont feel like playing wa1 and ff7 anymore
wild arms 2 had everything that was good in lufia 2 and took all of it farther  the puzzles and dungeons arent just link to the past ripoffs each level has a unique look to them the tools in the game are all utilized creatively for solutions  each character has a unique way of using attacks and growing stronger as well as a ff6 summoning equipment feature and a skill point tree on top of that its a lot of different features to take in on top of the battle system but the game compensates for that with some really forgiving grinding  it lets you jump right into the game and brute force it if you have to but then it rewards you for picking up on the different game mechanics     camera work is probably my favorite it uses a rotating camera like in grandia but it takes a page from isometric rpgs where theres a lot more to climb around and explore the game also limits the camera angles to 8 directions and keeps everything more grid based and blocky so you cant get as lost as easily as you would in grandia    the only thing it really suffers from is its translation which gives it a few castlevania ii moments where you cant find the next objective without a walkthrough theres a lot of missable stuff anyway so a spoiler free walkthrough is recommended
  can you get the general jist or is it beyond fucked   i dont know if i should leave it for later when i get the motivation back to pick up my jap studies again   i cant learn japanese
  thanks this actually makes it sound pretty nice im pretty eager to play it now
zed   or  liz  ard    which one    
  liz  ard no contest
  i beat the game quite recently and theres nothing wrong with the translation or any particular confusion with directives this isnt bof     worldmap locations arent really visible though so if youre not thorough youll have trouble
  play as kid  game has credits like 20 into the story  well that was a short game  turn off before credits end  play again as an adult  80 of the game was left after those oddly placed credits
  lol hadnt you ever watched a movie before    i feel like youre just making a joke on purpose here
reminder every wild arms starts with tony and ends with ragu o ragula
  no that really happened i was just retarded
  meant for  
  /this was a wild arms thread      is the translation really just flat out terrible i can slog a lot of mechanics for rewarding/missable content but if the story is flat iyt bad and unreadable itll be a massive waste of time i feel
    the translation is fine for its era theres one or two typos in the directions    locations on the world map have to be found through dowsing and there are one or two times where they game will tell you to search east instead of west
you can name your spells penis  thats all i remember
  there are one or two times where they game will tell you to search east instead of west  first rule of exploration club is to go where youre told to last of all so unless youre given directions to backtrack it shouldnt cause any problem
  its weird really theres some parts of the translation that got through unscathed but other parts are total messes i figure the interactions with liz and ard was some sort of japanese word game that just couldnt really be translated into english well
  mexican anime
  that doesnt work with the dowsing mechanic dowsing was a neat idea the game had to make secret locations a little more difficult to fine but it absolutely didnt turn out well since the landmark doesnt show up on the world map until you dowse for it youre never sure if youre looking in the wrong place or if you just barely missed the location when you were dowsing
other than the translation feeling dry as a bone hows the remake of wa1
  i liked it for what it was
  it doesnt really improve on anything that was already there and basically goes too far on a bunch of other stuff and hams it right up
  i still cant believe how a ps1 game got a lot of songs in it
booted up wa2 because of this thread try to document any thoughts if i go further but i do really enjoy environmental dungeon design i missed that after playing wa1 so many years ago i also enjoy the easy to understand mana/arm system
  about ten hours into it its actually a pretty nice little rpg it reminds me a lot of golden sun i really like the spell system especially
why wont sony rerelease alter code f anywhere im fucking livid that game is expensive as fuck
finished all prologue sections lillia was fun  mostly because encounters were nonentities but my main gripe could be this font all game
    the translation is largely fine but they pretty much had no editor so its a mess and yeah liz and ard have similar nonsensical lines in japanese because theyre aliens
  its your emulators fault use an accurate one like xebra instead
the worst part of wa1 is how long it takes to save the game because the save menu is so slow
    yeah im pretty sure that font is supposed to have a drop shadow
  liz makes perfect sense hes just speaking in traditional japanese poetry forms and hes pretty much direct translated which works because theres really no play on words or anything there
      a good place to start in case anyone actually cares about  what did liz mean by this  and isnt just looking to turn their brain off in the face of cognitive dissonance and meme their way out of everything
  played them as a kid and they were okay never felt the desire to play them again as a manchild   the ost is pretty nice though have a listen    
  i played both a year ago wild arms is definitely in my top 5 ps1 games it just oozes charm for me suikoden i consider a slow mess that has some interesting ideas need to play 2 for both series didnt help i played suikoden right after wild arms it felt so slow to control after sprinting everyplace in wa
  this is my favorite track  
   didnt figure out how to run in suikoden
  it still is much worse to control since you can only move in 4 directions almost on a grid in comparison to diagonal movement in wa
    this my fav
  lol i spent some time getting used to xebra and even got the img mounted and playing with great sound quality and it did fix the text but the sprite of ashley itself now carries garbage graphics around displacing him in any 3d environment and from what i understand the point of xebra is no video plugins    caught the cat but bad recommendation friend
  doesnt psxfin work fine with wa2
  son the game of finding an emulator and configuration/troubleshooting is the biggest motivation killer to starting a new game anyway ignoring my post whining like a fag i finally got it working and xebra seems like a really nice emulator to use from now on will continue on
  you should play them for the translations alone is what i could say but these games are worth more than that    wa games in general are respectful of the players time battle speeds are more than decent puzzles range from laughably simple to acceptable mindbenders the osts are hot and not particularly handholdy like things you read on bookshelves or here from npcs are often pretty darn relevant be it immediately or for things coming later on like these games have the worst world map ever first of all you have to find/buy one secondly its not an onscreen minimap but press select to view and thirdly it shows only places youve been to already youre expected to find new towns/areas on your own via dialogue general direction finding especially in wa2 where places literally arent displayed on the overworld until youve discovered them    wa1 is short the most basic of them all but never not a good starting point its also where a ton of repeat terms/things that come in later games start from    wa2 is just bananas storywise the puzzles ramp up and battle system gets more fleshed out unlike the first game this one has more than a couple of standout unforgettable moments too its good stuff
  posts like this do make me wanna explore the jrpg wasteland i like that he fav plays every time i load the game lol
  psxfin is the ease of use emulator  epsxe is the the two dozen games it actually can run i get to upscale emulator  mednafen is the i dont need an interface and im just gonna play single disc games emulator
  single disc fucking disgusting for psone never even heard of psxfin im an oldfag so ive just used epsxe pretty consistently to run resident evils and standard fair jrpg the upscaling is nice though be honest sound is garbo    xebra seems like it does it shit well being a moonrune emulator is quaint too which games does epsxe really struggle with beside fine details like that font issue
  i remember 15 years ago using epsxe to play almost everything from persona to gallop racer to monster rancher and they all worked perfect did anything change since then
for all people who liked wa1 what do you think about alter code f
  its terrible
  worse than the original
    care to elaborate why im honestly asking i havent played it
  seconding this reading this thread made me want to replay wa1 but having calamity jane in the party sounds interesting
    its basically got a bunch of really cheesy low budget anime type scenes that recreate moments from the original game while explicitly spelling out everything thats happening just in case anyone couldnt follow along in the first game or couldnt figure out exactly explicitly whats up with rudy    you get jane and emma and zed in your party but it turns out theyre all sort of a chore to have around and switch in and out of your party and were generally much more enjoyable as characters who were off doing their own thing and occasionally helping the main trio out as a sort of temporary not going to fight with you buddy    it also adds a bunch of scenes and moments that werent in the first game and frankly didnt need to be mostly having to do with how incredibly tragic everyones life was just hammed right up there when in the original game they sort of just got over it or toughed it out instead with their lingering complex sort of echoing in the background and being dealt with when it was actually appropriate    like theres actually a part where you have to go back to that first farming village with rudy because apparently hes all sad about it this time even though it was ostensibly just a single stop on his journeys in the first game and a moment that becomes irrelevant in the face of bigger issues but not in acf in acf everyone needs closure and validation on every single thing    some say that less is more and acf proves that sometimes just adding more is just awful
  mednafen can run multidisc games theres just no gui for it read the docs and use f6/f8
    eeelew        thisthey should have kept it about a semi medieval world that was the remains of a techno paradise
wild arms is a fun simple rpg with a great soundtrack i love the first two and they will always have a special place in my collection
  lol im not gonna use your shitty emulator i already said i got xebra working and thats probably more accurate then whatever youre peddling
this always seemed a bit harsh for a chill dude like ken
chill  hes a fucking savage
the man beats up people in the street for a living i would hardly call him chill
  remember when he muttered ill kill him quick to himself during the dan cutscene in svc chaos what the fuck is kens problem
  thats horrible
  i think i recognize the artist  it ends in guro right
  ken is the most alpha street fighter with the most chad victory poses
  virgin ryu/chad ken
    indeed
  ryu spends a his time practicing his shotokan style ken already mastered it added fire to his moves cause its sick and goes home every night to fuck his wife
  thats not even harsh and comes off as a defensive statement more than anything    if you want to talk harsh look at zangief threatening to break your arms or dhalsim saying he will destroy you unprovoked
  get a load of this fucking misogynist pig
    free abortion man ken knows a baby would ruin her young life
  tangle with me and you got problems dude im fast i got a fireball and my dragon punches take off loads of energy my fierce dragon punch has an awesome reach my jab dragon punch gets me out of tough upclose situations  jump at me man heh youll be hurt for sure plus i got a hurricane kick that puts me right where i want to be close enough to do some major damage hell offense or defense im gonna be in your face
  one for the fap folder
  ryu serious but respectful  ken flamboyant and flashy a bit arrogant but otherwise nice guy  guile nothing personal just business apologizes if he broke anything  chunli doesnt want to hurt you but you cant get in her way  blanka savage and feral  e honda selfimportant but honors the traditions of his craft  dhalsim sage and wise wants to offer the opponent another way out  zangief patriotic and prideful in his strength  balrog dumb and aggressive punch first and dont ask questions  vega vain and sadistic looks for any excuse to draw blood  sagat cold but fair  bison megalomaniacal you are just an ant that needs to be squashed  cammy stern and dutybound chunli but without sympathy  dee jay funloving and smooth  t hawk stoic with a good heart  fei long quiet fury difficult to anger but always tense  akuma utmost devotion to training you arent worth his time unless he deems it so
  my dick sauce    sorry i dont like kebab go settle somewhere else
why the fuck do you have to kill him so many times in this fucking game i dont get it
the only time you actually fight sephiroth is at the end every other instance was jenova controlled by sephiroth from the lifestream
  you only fight him once any other time it was jenova looking like him even the famous sephiroth killing aeris it was jenova that did it
it started as one of the writers diary he would always get bullied by this one kid in his schoolhe was a teacher assistant so he wrote out these different ways he planned to kill him and bring him back to life to do it again elements of that made it ibto the game like he would kill tge kids girlfriend in front of him he also liked blade runner a lot so he made some crappy doodles and gave it to the art team look it up if you dont believe me
  but then if it was sepiroth controlling jenova like   said then no it actually was sephiroth that did it
    how was he controlling her i thought she was all powerful alien who could destroy the planet
  sephiroth doesnt control anything hes dead and bathing in the lifestream for 99 of the game he cant get reabsorbed into it because he has too much alien dna jenova revives him with her dying lifeforce
  i thought she was all powerful alien  just a mind control parasite
is there a bigger loser in gaming than sephiroth    born from rape  raised to be a mindless soldier faggot  dyslexic  goes mad because he cant fucking read  gets chopped by a failed grunt  spends whole game sitting around while mommy does everything for him  given ultimate power but jobs again
  you can tell so much about the parents and how this child is going to look when its older just from looking at its disgusting little pig face
  lets name our kid after a character that dies before hes two years old
tfw ive gotten to the end of both this and ff6 and never finished either
  then you didnt really get to the end did you
alright everyone we need an original villain for our game dont just go and copy the bad guy from dragon quest
      you know at least theyre still better than all the gamer couples who decide to become childfreecels and collect plastic star wars toys instead of having kids
  cool guys with long swords and long hair were just in in the early 90s  look at zero from megaman x
because its (((deep)))
  such a generic design for that era too dq by no means was new or unique in having a long haired manlet with a sword
  this final battle is in clouds mind   come the fuck on guys    it really is since the 30yearolds who played this as teenagers cant understand the final fight
  depend what is the end  the fight in the op isnt neither sephiroth is a fight inside cloud head  ffvii is basically aerith and jenova playing chess
  you arent fighting sephiroth youre fighting clouds demons
  funko pops are my children
that last little battle is just so you can see omnislash and have the ultimate shounen moment the game was always building up to sure you can get omnislash early if you do an absurd amount of a fickle minigame but your first time around youre supposed to wonder where clouds little sidequest is for his limit give up and go beat the game only to have it foisted upon you for the finale
  im not sure i ever finished the game desu i think i got to final battle very underlevelled died reloaded and proceeded to level the shit out of everything 99 for all characters max materia levels master materia for all characters best weapons armor killed ruby weapon and emerald weapon and then i think i stopped playing so i never finished the game but still saw nearly everything it had to offer except the ending lol     i even discovered the dupe glitch on my own
  damn this game did a terrible job expressing its plot nuances to a western audiences 20 years later and im still not sure what the fuck happened i understood the individual plot points but not sephiroths plan and motivation
  thats mostly the fault of the translation it was a lot clearer what happened in japanese its fine i didnt even know if cloud was the real cloud or a clone with zacks memories the first time i played because it wasnt clear in the english version
  jenova is not sentient and sephiroth is also not in control of his own actions he only thinks he is he just rationalizes himself toward the goal that jenova gives him jenova is a parasite that eats planets and it only borrows the sentience of its living hosts manipulating them to strive to achieve its goals by their own made up justifications    the only character who ever figures out what is actually going on is aeris
listen this is what actually happens per the ultimania omega guide    right up until this moment here sephiroth is more or less on the same level as cloud obviously there is a level difference but the only rift between them is experience and talent not anything supernatural at this point sephiroth having been infused with jenova cells the same as hojos other test subjects is drawn to the nibelheim reactor where the whole of jenova is kept    then cloud tosses him into a sea of mako as you can see during disc 2 this nearly destroys cloud but sephiroth manages to survive and feed off it because muh willpower like thats literally the official reason at this point his power becomes so great that he achieves complete control over jenova if theres a sizable hunk of jenova sitting around somewhere he can manipulate it and turn it into the monsters you fight on the boat at the forgotten city and in the crater if theres a few stray jenova cells lying around in someones body you can imagine those to be puppeteers strings  an imperfect sort of control    sephiroth is the one in control completely  now you may be thinking but it makes for a much better and more logical story if its actually jenova whos the bad guy and    and youd be right but thats not the way they went
  sephiroth is the one in control completely  now you may be thinking but it makes for a much better and more logical story if its actually jenova whos the bad guy and  and youd be right but thats not the way they went  its ru all over again
  time to play a good rpg op pic related  give up that bloated turn based cinematic experience shit
they should have made it a real fight leading up to omnislash  impossible to lose victory laps are garbage give me a true final boss like trance kuja followed immediately by necron
  this
  aw man washington really ugh
  absolutely sick game
  how can he control jenova just because of the lifestream jenova isnt connectedto the planet and lifestream
  its retarded that this shit is going to be confirmed as the canon in the remake for the sake of making sephiroth clouds rival
  dd mystara is nuts the combat and monsters are really well done you can get some sick combos going and each hit lands with a really satisfying thud/wack/bam     its also hard as fuck trying to clear it on one continue even on the default setting is a challengebut its fun to learn and doesnt feel unfair or clunky modern games need to learn from it i think dragons crown is okay but it couldve been so much better if it sacrificed some rpgelements in favor of actionelements
brainlets are pretending sephiroth being in control is a retcon but it is not the story is in fact very clear    jenova lands leading to a plot that is basically the thing  jenova is rediscovered and used for experiments resulting in creatures containing its genes  jenova reactivates and moves seemingly controlling all those containing its genes  however the tables have turned one experiment has grown so powerful that he instead controls jenova    to discredit sephiroth is stupid this guy literally willed himself back to life after falling into the lifestream something even his most successful clone could not do by himself
   sephiroth is in control but his goal just happens to be the exact same as jenova  im sure thats what sephiroth is telling himself
          did you guys not play the game sephiroth hijacks all control from jenova and simply uses its hivemind ability to have the clones do everything for him     jenova still has a little bit of consciousness left as evidenced by the dialogue during the fights but sephiroth is largely running the show
  so this kid is 13 now hes finally at the right age to play final fantasy 7 and also the right age to start questioning his parents decision making skills
id be willing to watch a youtube video that properly explains the minutia ive done 100 on ff7 this year and there was plenty that wasnt explained clearly enough
  after falling into the lifestream    excuse me after being thrown into the lifestream by the loser who couldnt even get into soldier and who was therefore not yet infused with mako that he just ran through with his sword sephiroth died five years before the start of the game
  minutia the game is just obtuse it was the 90s and neon genesis was big everything was obtuse and open to interpretation
  no cleric  credit feeders spotted
    nah this is nowhere as convoluted as evangelion and even eva makes sense im aware the translation was pretty bad not only with typos but it made everything more convoluted
  its really interesting how his reasoning aligns with this for an independent reason then he comes to understand he was never a cetra but he still continues on doing the same thing anyway but just switches his justification for it it comes off as textbook mindcontrol
        as much as i hate to admit it this is one of the reasons why abortions should stay legal and at some point become state mandated for certain type of people
    absolutely not ethnic cleansing eugenics and undoing all the subversion should be legal not abortion
  not letting retards and thots eradicate themselves and their spawns through abortion so you can focus your time and efforts on undoing the subversion    top kek
    that takes too long and also the lives of good people in the process
  is this stuff written down somewhere for absolute brainlets
    but not sephiroths plan and motivation    this legitimately is inconsistent and makes no sense he supposedly goes insane once he reads a heap of shit about the cetra/ancients believing he is one and that modern humans and the decedents of those who destroyed his race so he spazzes out and kills people ultimately wanting to restore his race to its former glory but the thing is this was never the truth he was never a cetra rather hes a lifeform merged with jenovas cells and on top of this jenova was the one mainly responsible for wiping out most of the cetra i dont think the game ever goes into how or if he deals with this but he carries on the same but wanting to become a godlike being with his mother who has obviously been influencing his will this whole time given shes a mind raping alien master of deception but what do i know
  sephiroths entire rampage is based around his shit ability to research he could basically be in an image macro that says when you 20 minutes deep in a conflagration and you realize you misunderstood something
  his goal is to become a god by merging with the lifestream where exactly is it stated that this is jenovas goal or right it isnt
  he fell into the lifestream and did sum learnin
  just because the parents are bad doesnt mean the children are bad
    thats a pointless rhetoric that has led the world into the state its in right now right along with human rights and not all of x race is bad so lets have them run amok and destroy civilization
  maybe the lifestream is organic but magical maybe jenova is organic but magical maybe crystals are condensations of knowledge and wisdom thats left behind when something joins or is consumed by one or the other force capable of manipulating that magic that runs through the ff multiverse    maybe jenova cells are actually what create all the horrific monsters and mutants and undead demons and shit in all the ff games and are the living embodiment of evil and hatred jenova just wants to infect the lifestream and grow and incubate within it like a disease until it can kill and consume the planet itself and move on to another until everything is dead    i kind of wish theyd just flat out say this is whats happening because it fits surprisingly well with the series as a whole
  criminals are individuals anon you have to punish each one accordingly and the children themselves cant be punished until they commit that crime themselves
    talk about a stretch and that would just give more fuel to the vii is best ff meme which it isnt
    good goy
  the jewish religion is itself not criminal or evil but any individual who still tried to practice human trafficking would be a criminal deserving judgement otherwise just dont get tricked the jews cant do anything to you unless you sign the contract willingly and misuse your money like a fool    the actual religion thats definitively criminal is islam
    i wont go down this rabbit hole on /vr/ especially with a jew
  i think hes a freemason actually
  the actual religion thats definitively criminal is islam  /
  its just typical jrpg final boss nonsense its partially responsible for the this isnt even my final form meme along with anime like dbz    if you just fight bizzaro sephiroth and then the game ended what kind of an ending is that its more fun that he essentially reveals a more powerful form gets his shit kicked in even harder and then is finaly killed in his original true form    and thats just if you dont buy into the idea that the last little duel is just in clouds head    in that version you basically just assume that little exchange as cloud not only defeating his nemesis physically but internally as well killing the sephiroth that lives in his head rent free and becomming able to move on with his life  an idea that advent children totally misses but thats neither here nor there
  if you killed him he wouldnt be coming back for another fight idiot
  its partially responsible for the this isnt even my final form meme  this trope is older than dirt even in the same series kefka does it to such even more ludicrous extent that itd come across as parody nowadays
  jenova is a mind control parasite sephiroth isnt controlling anything hes being manipulated by his jenova cells same as all those black robed reunion fags the only major difference is that sephiroth was cloned from jenova while the rest are just jobbers that got experimented on
i feel the biggest reason to believe that sephiroth is in control at least by the end of the game is that sephiroth is the final boss and jenova is his last line of defense if i was a big evil parasite thing id be making the almost godlike pawn defend me not me defend it
  wise choice shills infested the blue boards after 2016 like a fucking plague
why the fuck does this have so few players probably the best basic deathmatch game out there
no steam release honestly
    makes sense i wonder why they dont have a steam page
  because its a movie licensed game and to get an official release would require the agreement of mgm nintendo rare not to mention the game uses the likeness of the actors from the movie so overall its a licensing clusterfuck that none of these parties would ever agree to especially as a free release
    o right
  just rename it something dumb like gilded iris or something
    good idea of course everything else would have to be renamed as well
  you can still sue and win if you can prove similarities in look sound feel config etc would never work    sad
  i play it  i also live in argentina so sorry pal
    me too but there are never more than like 20 people on 2 servers
why the fuck does everyone only play arsenal
  best deathmatch    nintoddlers actually believe this
    t someone who has never played goldeneye source
  please tell me which console has goldeneye source on it  dumb faggot
its ruined by adding jumping and freeaim
  fuck anyone who plays as strangeoccupation
  had a good laugh last time i played this a bunch of zoomers were accusing me of aimbotting because i was dropping them without slowing down/targeting cmon kiddies goldeneye didnt have a standard reticle you gotta line up your screen
i forgot all about this mod how many people actually play it now    way back in 2006 or 07 we would play the fuck out of this after cs practice/matches 10mans were dead for a couple of months because were just jamming the beta version for the nostalgia kick
  what is apple vs microsoft
  fun game  i like almost all quake3 engine or unreal 1 engine based shooter deathmatch games more but its a great game desu
  are there any other source mods still active
  they ruined it in recent updates by making it so your shots will arbitrarily not do damage if you shoot too fast instead of fixing the fire rate
unreal/unreal tournament general    share some of your stories from singleplayer/multiplayer show off some new maps mods mutators etc and just have fun    check out the pastebin      thread music 
ut4 is dead  ut99 lives    this timeline aint so bad
  what happened to ut4 my last ut was 2004 but ut3 wasnt so bad after launch
  fortnite happened epic moved the team over to fortnites development team to focus on it they said they got some guys working on the coding but nothing major so its on a hiatus until fortnite stops being popular in the next 2 years
  whats the difference between unreal multiplayer and unreal tournament
  was ut4 that abysmal
  nah just a lil bit
  thread music  embed  why would anyone do this the genesis sound chip is abysmal
  ut4  it was being worked by two guys that shitted all over the collaboration between gamers and developers also its similar to ut99 when we already saw what happened with ut3
  its great when you know how to program fm patches  
  nothing for it well just return to ye olde mods
  so its on a hiatus until fortnite stops being popular in the next 2 years    even if they get back to ut4 its already too late
not playing the best map that requires skill  
  this mod kind of looks like shit m8
  not really the devs had a bit of trouble with balancing the weapons and changing them to worse versions of themselves but they eventually fixed them
i miss playing ctf and assault on stock maps with full servers
    double enforcers best weapon short of redeemer    prove me wrong you cant
  de is the pro weapon new players run around with the flak cannon or rocket launcher pros teleport around like ninjas and waste people with the des or telefrags at least that was my experience back when ut was still alive
  they are insanely broken they deal more damage compared to a miniguns alt fire they deal a flat 15 damage so 30 damage in total you can fuck up just about anyone
    shock rifle is kinda better because you can attack around corners too and then theres the obvious sniper rifle
  de is the pro weapon  when sheep in wolfs clothing open their mouths
  teleports into you  psshh nothing personal kid
  translocates away
  but anon pic related
  god mode on  loaded
  sadly there were only about 5 composers worth shit who had the technical knowledge to do this
  5 composers is an understatement but most of the good ones were either japanese or european since they had more experience with the hardware
  theyre good but they can get outclassed by the other hitscan weapons like the sniper
  guns slightly rebalanced prettier maps no flashlight deathmath
  there were a lot more than 5 you just seek out bad games
  just needs a new compatibility patch for ut99
  gun jesus with de   
  no real m16 with a long barrel and scope
  i hate the aesthetics its kinda like 2k4 but worse
  the one thing thats broken in 99 is the head hitbox size
  the head hitbox is the upper 20 of an actors cylinder if i remember well
  anon please dont hurt my heart like that
  the closest youll get to a ut99 sniper rifle
i bought the unreal anthology in middle school probably around 2006 primarily for unreal i never made it past a few hours in because i get bored everytime i try but i got addicted to bot matches in 99 and 2k4 would play it on my school laptop in highschool in the middle of class and whisper yell fuck when some fucker killed my streak unfortunately i was too late for good online play that wasnt assault or heavily modded so bots were the only way to go pretty much from 2006 to now unless i wanted to play 3 once in a while but now thats all shitty sniper matches       i had so many hopes for ut4 but it felt like they just gave up on adding news maps and i feel like mutators werent really a hing in it of which they should have been the 3 maps they have get stale fast and the connection is always choppy as a stick of celery wherever i play it
      
  ut4 is still getting some updates from the community someone was able dig up the robot necris with hoodie and possibly a thundercrash character from the files and uploaded some of them
any good as maps to recommend
does the ut community tolerate newbies    ive often been tempted start playing some ut99/04 but if every server is filled to capacity with high skill high autism players i dont know if ill be able to stick around for long im getting incredibly sick of quake champions so id love to try something new
  you would need to find people playing ut99 on anything other than ctf_facingworlds first the only players ive ever seen are playing on that map 24/7 with sniper rifles not even a full server game is dead anon
  disregard     you can find people in the siege servers the ctf servers dawns deathmatch palace full metal jacket and monster hunter servers just pick which ever server that wets your whistle
  the community is old enough that dont give a fuck about if youre good or not no visual skill level to have spergs go crazy about just play to have fun
  im   if what you say is true im going to reinstall last time i had ut99 installed that was the state of the online play if i can finally play stock ctf again ill be very happy
  theres a server that hosts both regular ctf and instagib
  yeah theyll even take the time to show you the ropes most of the time i know i do when someone asks
  i always figured ut99 would have a very small stream of new players because of how popular it was on high school computers even when i was in high school 7 years ago everyone played it
  some people in the ut4 forums actually suggested that in order to make it popular epic should just add battle royale mode
  sad
  any more war machine art
  what are good mods for ye olde unreal you can play through the main campaign with
  in order to make it popular they need to make a new singleplayer unreal game first thats how old arena shooters gained popularity    release good sp game  people want to play it in mp  make special mp version with bells and whistles  people play it    onlineonly works for flavour of the month genres and games in established sp franchises  even battlefield and cod still lure people in with solid sp experience first then ride on it into mp but it was 2 whole decades after the last good sp unreal experience most people that play fortnite and overwatch these days werent even born back then
  cont  im pretty sure that ut wouldve spiked in popularity if epic made a return with sp unreal title same way id did with doom
      what unreal single player was good i first played ut99 multiplayer after playing ut2003 multiplayer i was hooked on quake/hl/cs for fps and ignore ut99 at the time the only unreal single player game i played was unreal 2 awakening and it was pretty forgettable
  the one from 98 before ut99  unreal 2 was made by legend not epic    first unreal is an atmospheric journey through the beautiful but hostile world it starts running out of steam in the last quarter 25 levels in  but before that its gorgeous and you definitely should play it
  damn what a blind spot thanks for the tip
  a server with fucking people just reinstalled and the online scene is just as fucking dead as it was back when i first deleted it out of the 9 servers that have more than 5 fucking people only 3 have more than 10 one of those is fucking facingworlds the other two are running a shitton of custom skins and maps while being hosted on a 56k im not desperate enough for a game of ut99 to bother with these empty servers why did you lie anon
  those names
  lame 2002 teens are offtopic in /vr/ right
  nothing beats orgazmo
  there was an era where such cringe names where acceptable  i dont know how to feel    who dat
just got unreal gold anything i should know before i start any mods needed to get it to work properly
  he will never be part of the 1337//4x0rz coolkidz
  
  just update the game with the latest patch
  skaarj and prisoner adventure when
  a guy from a strangelove clan i thought the name and playing as a skaarj was a hilarious combination  
  dont forget the godlike music that fits with the atmosphere
    the stacy prisoner  the virgin skaarj
        shy skaarj getting humand by dominant feminine prisoner 849 when
  when japan takes notice of the franchise
  funny enough i remember watching a video of japanese players fucking around in ut99 mp they also had their own selection of weirdass skins and custom sounds
  do you think you could find that video again
  
  thank you they arent half bad i wonder what mods theyre using the one for damage feedback seems useful
  from best to worst how would you rate the officially released versions of ut99 overall
  from a security point of view the latest version of 451 ut99 is the best
  watch some of their duel videos they are pretty good ive been to their server before and they have a loque bot set to the highest difficulty and equipped with the sniper
hear this when you play the unreal remake    made by the man himself too
  how about the console versions dreamcast or ps2 which is better
  ps2 version is the best it has better audio quality more characters to play and i think it has some of the pc maps including its own maps
  ps2 all the way
how can i fix this it doesnt seem to happen with the other weapon models
  seems to be an fov problem which d3d10 fixes but the d3d10 renderer doesnt seem to work well with fast sync
  chile
  share some of your stories  when you get your first translocator frag
  not simultaneously fapping to hunter from q3 and female commando
  i think it was the female commando that got me into girls with leotards
  beats playing online games on steam and seeing firstlastname96
  hunter  not crash and her death grunts especially
  not wanting a chocolate amazon to ride you  you disappoint me
  chocolate is always better
  
real talk how would gina realistically wear the suspenders over the tank top on the side of the boobs or pressed over them
  theres a remake
  talking shit about hunter  
  there was i dont know if they are still working on it
  pressed over her breasts would make sense and hot
  link to it anon
  indeed
  its on the ut4 forums
  no it was a good game that was shaping up to be great had it established a playerbase sadly epic would cave in and make a battle royale shooter
  this is or some generic name with no care or thought into that back then usernames had meaning
why are you posting neofag screencaps anon
  hes totally right quake 3 is an experience tailored and focused on muh skills and ut is a sprinkled game made for fun both are fine at least theyre not identical
  epic decided to absolutely rape the game and wreck the balance as well as take the game in a direction added uc2style grenade launcher to phase out biorifle removed grenades from rocket launcher removed impact hammer from a lot of the game that the community did not want after doing that they decided to abandon it for what has been well over a year now and focus entirely on fortnite
    in addition to that the game has a better engine slightly better mod support and a shit ton more content
  lol thats one thing i liked about unreal and ut99 the rifles being the most basic weapons are antiquated pieces of equipment in comparison to everything else in ut99 it was simply an ar pattern rifle with a scope attached
  you should check out the site old unreal they have made their own graphics and sound patches for the game as well as new textures and hd skins which require said patch because they have to be enabled as a mutator to work
is the unreal packs on steam or gog worth full price
  i found that ut actually requires more skill than quake quakes bunny hopping and more basic weapons make the game more predictable whereas uts movement largely thanks to dodging tends to be less predictable and the the weapons arent so simple in quake each weapon has a dedicated purpose and you only use them outside of said purpose if you really have to in ut each weapon has situations where theyre best in but due to the effectiveness of each one combined with slower switch speeds you as a player will have to play favorites a lot of the time and a fire fight is always determined by who knows their gun better
  they went where the players were deathmatch is basically dead people arent interested
  this    the sad reality is that nobody under 25 wants to play these kinds of games any more    ut4 is dead quake champions is just barely alive even with all the korean mmostyle incentivisation for players to log in and play daily    these games just do not build or maintain player bases beyond a few hundred oldschool diehards i wish it werent the case but it so obviously is the case teens today arent interested in this gameplay    i dont know why they prefer the casual garbage that they do but they do
  post the full pic
  back then usernames had meaning    hah no
  is that why q3 is a worse in terms of balance than ut not that ut is in any way perfect
  back then usernames had meaning    have to come up with a new name before i play online  i want to play now  implying im about to sit here for 45 minutes trying to decide on a name    my handles on the internet have largely always been my nickname  my favorite numbers its been this way since i was 12
  its not only young people theyre just the most obviously not interested us slightly older 30year old boomers are mostly over deathmatchstyle games too and for good reason  1 fps reflexes get worse with age less practice  body slowing i cant aim for shit these days as a teen i was pretty good  2 shallow gameplay  yeah it was fun but it was all we had modern diverse gameplays now distract us from the boring old dm there is just so much more to play  3 deathmatch is a simple game style based on kills so your k/d ratio is all important as a yardstick for being good and having fun this makes it particularly easy for people to try a game suck then quit with fewer noobs others k/d suffers and the entire pyramid scheme of killing collapses with only a small inaccessible community of hardcore pros left ive experienced this in multiple fps games over the last decade so its not only old games that suffer this by contrast battle royale makes almost everyone in the match a loser and downplays k/d so people might suck but they find their own expressive form of play style and they come back for more
  to elaborate on 3 because i think this is the primary reason dm died cod and other more casual fpss manage to not bleed players because nobody can really get that good its a high skill ceiling that inherently allows players to dominate and make others leave to go find a game they dont suck at this sounds stupidly obvious but im convinced a large number of veteran /vr/ shooter people dont realize this
  youre a fool its hard to imagine how you could reach that age and yet be so ignorant about a hobby you clearly have some interest in     first things first you are not a boomer if youre in your 30s youre a boomer if youre in like your 60s thats the meme so you fail automatically by falling for a zoomer meme that you dont even understand as to your points     1 people dont stop playing because their reflexes get worse thats not how it goes people play for fun i bet you could never aim for shit as a teen either at a certain point they wont be competitive at the worlds elite but neither are golf and tennis players yet old people play them all the time   2 you are pretty much the only person in the entire history of gaming that has ever suggested that old fps games have shallow gameplay that is insane and not even worthy of a discussion modern shooters are point and click affairs older fps games demand much more even casual shooter champions admit this   3 i dont even know what the fuck are you on about here no k/d ratio does not determine fun i suggest you get your brain together or kys you might also find use of the phrase better to remain silent and appear a fool rather than speak and remove all doubt
  if you are talking about the holy trinity of quake 3 then it is literally better than ut because shock combos single handedly ruin ut for me even though the rest of the game is stellar that shit is a commonly found portable nuke that sips on ammo with pin point hitscan accuracy and blast radius and splash damage all combined into one it enrages me to even type that out because it never occurred to me that the shock rifle is literally every mechanic and trope rolled up into one gun
  usernames then were either cool hilarious or made to be selfdepricating
  truly the worst timeline friends there is an earth where unreal tournament is played in droves in such a way as fortnite is
  1 i dont have a scientific study but in my experience people get worse as they get older anecdotally look at professional fps players theyre mostly 1625 partly due to burnout but partly due to aging body  2 i wasnt saying modern shooters have more depth but that games in general offer much more diverse gameplays now just like when wow and mmorpgs came out and stole a bunch of players from all our fps games there are more genres gameplays and games than ever vying for our attention  3 i would refer you to theories of fun such as flow where skill grows with challenge if someone is consistently owned by better players such that they have say a 1 to 3 k/d they are not very skilled and thus not as invested in the game do you really think its a coincidence or just stupidity that modern fps designs level the playing field by introducing far lower skill ceilings and more random elements    if you still disagree with my view why not offer another reason as to why fps games have changed and deathmatch is out is it pure fashion
  meant to write 1 to 3 k/d
  look at this fucking noob
is there a list of maps for ut99 that are actually good/not gimmicky preferably keeping with the same design and aesthetics as the original maps
why isnt x popular anymore  back in the early 90s prior to the release of myst just about every single person i knew who owned a computer had at least one graphical adventure game now they are confined to the realm of indies during the 8 and 16 bit era platformers dominated console gaming now they are just indies and remakes and rehashes arcades used to be big here in the us good luck finding one with quality games now that isnt a dave and busters real time strategy games were popular since cc and warcraft 2 made them big and now they struggle to sell now everyone is going back to fps games but a randomized scavenger hunt style of gameplay instead of the arena deathmatch style that was king during the quake/unreal/doom/duke3d era    gaming tends to follow trends fans of a game will stick with it after the trend has passed but a lot of gamers just tend to hop on whatever is the hot new thing at the moment then you get a selffulfilling loop game has large playerbase new player figures he can find a game easily game playerbase grows if they would just play what they find fun instead of following the trend you would probably see more games with a few thousand players instead of 23 games with millions and every other game with less than 300
gonna cheat and throw in a gimmick map      here are the actual good maps          
  theres only 3 forgot to mention im only interested in deathmatch
  well theres a lot more i was just picking out some of them             
that one guy in ctf that takes all of the ammo in the base and rushes the enemy base leaving nothing for everyone else
part of the problem with reviving deathmatch is how tied it is with esports arena games have become closely associated with duels and heavily controlled games this is the total opposite of how it was played back then ffa and ctf were the big game modes and people just played whatever they want for every duel there are 50 ffas with people spamming rockets grenades willy nilly and 20 ctf games with people grappling around like idiots all of these on maps that werent league friendly if you were to let people actually play arena shooters like they actually were played back then instead of trying to heavily nudge them towards dueling because its what the pros do youd probably get more people playing them    theres also cultural shifts quake 1 and its successors such as quake 2 ut99 and halflife 1 was developed and became popular in a time when its players shared the hackers creed of being able to crack open a game and do whatever you want with it or host whatever instance of it because why not now gamers want games where theres a heavy moderator presence ques so you can instantly hop into the action rankings to show off your epeen buying skins to let the world see how cool you look and all content coming from and being controlled by the developers all of this is antithetical to how arena shooters were developed played and grew    arena shooters were created in and for a specific cultural moment and groups that have been lost to time you cant truly revive arena shooters unless you manage to delink dueling from being the core of arena shooters and manage to somehow brainwash every gamer into thinking like mid to late 90s computer nerds that all believed in the hackers creed in some way
  lolno
  the steam keys for it are cheap as hell
  matchmaking is what killed having communities in games instead of choosing a server that you like because of the players instead most games require that you push a button to instantly que with a group of strangers that may or may not ruin your game i dont know if its some lazy way to implement a multiplayer environment or what
  esports xxx420mlgsmokeweederryday420xxx is as big of a cancer to gaming as casual shit i agree its just another way for developers to cash in on trends
  wait for christmas deals they are usually priced at 10 or less
  i hate matchmaking too but i dont think it killed gaming communities they were already dying and people were asking for matchmaking before they became ubiquitous    my local gaming communities/server hubs died when internet speeds increased enough that people could play acceptably on distant servers also servers being owned/run by the publisher rather than individuals or isps made them impersonal
  ive never heard people asking for matchmaking it just seems like an option made for consoles that made its way to pc because it was the easiest way to implement multiplayer
  meme  were so use to 151719 inch monitors that are crt trust me try a old 17 or 15inch monitor and play cs/quake your aim will be superior the 24 inch monitors at 234 and because mouse fix is disabled now days a lot of peoples aim are done through raw input and theres no mouse filter so a lot of the cpi/dpis are just estimates remember faster is not better 400dpi was a baseline but because monitors grew so did the image/hitboxes
  gimmicky maps are not necessarily bad  i dont think such a list exists
  i believe dm has fallen out of fashion because it is extremely unforgiving and video games nowadays are seen as something you do to escape your life have fun during commute and kill time most players think this way and are not prepared to either be humiliated repeatedly or train for days to reach a minimum skill level in order to hold their own in the online battle  also dm includes a lot of things people no longer want to do timing weapons searching for the enemy listening carefuly and learning how the map is laid out is a chore for people who are used to rush a marker showing the objective through the walls on their hud and find everyone there with weapons they didnt have to hunt and time because they just selected a nice loadout at spawn  just my personal theory
  call of duty 4 truly was the beginning of the end
which mod had the xenas throwing ring blade that was the most fun weapon i had ever played with it was like the ripper on steroids
  there is 4 player local split screen for all unrealengine games on pc just found out about it    
this is going to sound dumb but what made me interested in ut is the fact that its a competitive/sports setting having objectives beside killing all the other players adds so much to me and even if in practice teamwork doesnt exist team games still feel like there is teamwork going on plus my mom always disliked these kinds of violent games so if she found me playing ut i can make the excuse that it isnt all about violence
  i think the whole futuristic gladiator concept is kinda neat
  yes and video games could do much more with that
  working as a team is something i adore as well assault mode especially at the height of 2k4 is the perfect blend of competitive and objective team based gameplay i really wish more games would adopt this mode and use it creatively because i miss playing it with people 
  the running man film is the closest to ut99 we will ever get to
return to nepal is very good look at those graphics omg
  exquisite graphics
  esports fps is disgusting because everyone aimhacks its a sad spectacle i want to see actual skill not you pressing a button to know this dude is hiding in this room and then charging him
  why does this keep getting posted is it funny
  hes very proud of his oc i think
  ive seen studies reflexes get worse as you age but only barely until you hit like sixty and then they drop noticeably but still not unplayable  but definitely competition loss worthy since you need to remain fairly high in every aspect of play to do well     im closer to forty and i still stomp 1625 year olds like no ones business in fact i arguably do so better than i did when i was 1625 because if my reflexes have slowed it hasnt outpaced my accuracy and improvement in muscle memory so while i could respond and aim okay when i was 1625 but now my aim is improved for things like cs i play similar in headshots and style as scream but without the cheats my map control and shit like that has also improved       your point about the k/d ratio is accute but also just say 1/30 kd not 01/3 i used to play q3 with friends and it was worse than that since id play against two or three friends against me with just me with teams and id still go 200/0 against them a full day could net up to 0/1000k/d for any one of them individually theyve never had more than a cumulative of five kills in over five years when they were active with me they got tired of it after a while some friends refused to play at all some were willing but changed their tune in some games like when id run around bh/rj around dm maps in q1 backwards picking up items pregame warmup and noped out most of them weaned off into other games since fps was the genre i dominated whereas that didnt apply to other genre or in some cases even becoming mediocre/worst player in other genres    though i dont play online fps anymore because theyre designed like trash and full of cheaters anyway no point i prefer singleplayer now or coop like warframe even coop can be problematic though if you dominate that as well
    okinu best ghost girl
reminder ctfface is the greatest fps map ever
  ahem
theres not enough art of prisoner 849 this must be fixed
  just found this whats the point of ut2k4 mechanics in ut99
  shouldve had the gore setting to none easiest way back then to convince any parent to buy mrated games
      my mom and aunt laughed at the bots screaming holy shit and you whore ordinarily they wouldve said something or made me turn off that kinda stuff in the game but they died laughing at it in ut
  add vehicles  make it onslaught 20
specks unreal returning from a hiatus organizing the group information a little more neatly and fixing up some things on the servers     adding to the faq/help sections getting rid of the old forums except for the informational threads/download links   those same links/files will also be on discord channels as well for newcomers to more easily see and know what files are needed   help section more easilly accessible for those having display or game issues   installed newnet and utcomp a while back as well added some more content to the jedi knight server   organized all the essential patches/bonuses for the games into one rar file for each bonus downloads like maps and skins also      i got a new job with regular hours and weekends off too so expect more regular hosting as long as i get off my lazy ass    might readd the few missing bonus maps for jedi knight and ut2004    i may add a couple more channels to the discord if anyone has some good ideas for one that may be useful after i add the guides/secrets/help channels ideas always welcome yall
  because why not
looking for some good ut2004 maps / mods sell me your favorites      also trying deperately to find the mutator that removes the red and blue teamskins from team gameplay i think its called  no team skins mut but i cant find a filemirror
  /vr/aaaaappp
  its 404d    
  link to deescord
  
          currently hosting ut2004 at 74647344
am i the only one who gets turned on by the sexy announcer in ut2k4
        why dont epic just let the fans create mods for it
  they are it just that any major update like replacing the weapons weapon balances etc is up to epic the fans so far released 3 new models maps are being made and assault is semifinishedi think
what are you guys doing for halloween
  try d3d9  its less buggy i think
  rlcoop but its hard asf without saves    graphics mods are hd skins begonenot mutator and probably some reshade effects pic related is me trying some
  rlcoop if you like to get kicked in the balls by the enemies and want more difficulty and stealth to your playthrough
  the rifle in the og unreal is a piece of skaarj technology look at the points at the end of the rifle
here is my 3dfxpowered w98se rig i built specifically for cs 16 and ut99 it has the 98 service pack 3 and will connect to the internet and i can even browse older websites on opera and ie5 it downloaded almost all of its own drivers with only the dazzle cf and i had the driver disc for it    i plan on adding a tape drive an internal zip and eventually watercooling it    gigabyte pga370 board  piii 1ghz coppermine  512mb pc133  3dfx voodoo 3 2000  intel 10/100 nic  creative labs vibra16 isa  20gb boot ide 5x 36gb scsi stack  adaptec 2940u scsi card    the only issue im having is trying to join steam servers with it on 98se
    the other issue im having is i cant connect to any online ut server and i have the 436 update what am i missing it will download all the server files and as soon as it connects i get kicked and says connection failed
  the ut99 movement and weapons mutator for ut2k4 is really good for example ut3 weapons and vehicles mut is pretty good too actually
  i believe steam servers wont accept 98se operating systems to connect as for ut99 you have to configure a new master server because gamespys master server has been down for years    
  have you checked the logs what server did you join
      im a dumb ass i did the 451 update it works now    as for nonsteam 16 where do i find the installer to let me join nonsteam 16 servers i really dont want to do an xp dual boot just for two games
  i think some servers are hosted as nonsteam servers the server names should have be named so
peeps in the ut2004 server if anyone wants to join     ut2004 8514410199 eu west
  ut99 hardly lives and theres nothing good about ut4 death because it was basically faster 99 with better weapon balance
  better weapon balance  you mean how they kept fucking around with the rocket launcher flak cannon and making the link gun a cooldown based weapon
  yes the game had better balance than 99 at said and not said moment even when link gun was dragging people on alt fire it was nowhere as broken as 99 shock rifle
  that was one of the reasons i left ut4 desu i wasnt keen on the movement i didnt like how everything looked like it was made of plastic but the cherry on top was they kept fucking with the guns and health and wahtnot
ive been meaning to get back to ut99 lately but im having trouble finding the server files i dont have and downloading from the ut client is kind of a no go  back then there was a pack some server owner had put together but i cant find itso some help  is there some way to find the needed files just from the ip or something like that
  what do you mean like downloading the files from the server it shouldnt be a problem acquiring the files with the server if it has the redirect which all servers have configured
  not anymore there is this  
  wait did they seriously cancel the project
  i dunno the link is just dead
  did you also install 451b that version fixes some other stuff including unrealed crashing
      krull0r is doing fine he even streams ocassionally on youtube
  i was talking about the ue4 remake being potentially dead
  great
im starting to feel guilty for not playing for a while
  hit those servers anon and frag em
when you dominate with just the impact hammer  filthy normies using bullets to kill
playing unreal gold every time i go through the passage to outpost 3j it gets stuck trying to connect or something i can go there with console commands but lose my weapons and shit wat do
  suicide
  just use console commands to get your stuff back but individually tough shit but you can do it
  yeah i had to resort to this luckily i havent had any more trouble with levels loading
  were talking about the actual ue4 remake that some people in the ut4 forums were working on i just remember that the person who started the project got banned after starting some shit with epic devs
how much longer until fortnite stops being popular and epic can return to unreal
  am i the only one that sincerely thinks ut4 will get out of hiatus once fortnite leaves early access and its not tht far  i really cant blame epic for thinking it needs all hands on deck at least for now
  i really hope so
  i prefer to use killall actor in the console thanks
  youre not the only one i really hope epic gets back to finishing ut4 it just may beat quake champions in its finished stage
this guy is coming after you which weapon do you use to defend yourself
  asmd shock rifle
  antiautism spray
  sooooo bio rifle
  wrong choice
  shockcombo his anal cavity
to those of you who get upsetti when you see no one online for ut99    most servers have certain times a day in which they are populated even filled you just have to learn what times you can play on certain servers and identify the few servers that display a fake number of players plenty of servers are packed on weekends late in the evening est there are bubbles of life left in the game and there are active discords that are used to arrange games its nothing like it used to be it never will be but not everyone is gone good games are still had and are worth the time
i played ut99 with bots most of the time  i tried going online but not dead servers were always some ctfface instagib only or sniper rifle only shitfest with crazy ping     shit i still boot it up sometimes music is the best i have the entire umx folder on my playlist
  its hard to find people that still play assault the best as servers are all empty and hardly anyone wants to play
  redeemer
  lets see him fight against the rl
jesus christ you guys this thread was started nearly 2 months ago
  opened on 4chanorg  alpha  closed on 4channelorg  omega  based
  slow board
    this is frightening
      two of the former champions before xan and malcom
  our previews threads have gone for longer i think that in a whole year we have had like 3 threads
  hard to believe ut99 was capable of facial animation 4 years before hl2s release
  im trying to find the picture of the same guy who made the asmd rifle but i only find that rl pic of him
  thats not really ut99 though its a wip version of the 20 engine its a missing link between ut99 and u2
  this thread is sill alive  is this good thing or not
  good

what are some good ut2k4 servers to play besides dmrankin servers
  freezetag servers are a thing and rpg mh are still around i believe
be 2005  big ass ut2004 lan party get together with friends  for weeks they all smack talked my slower athlon xp rig while they gamed on their fx51 setups  i brought the server to host all the games on  face3 ctf im literally killing the whole house with zoom instagib shock rifles from the top of my tower before they can get across the map to steal my flag  they never stole my flag not once  after 300 kills they unplugged the server  mfw made an entire fucking lan party ragequit    man i miss those days i would get steamrolled today if i tried to play ut2004 online
  just thinking that i never saw this game in its prime makes my heart hurt
  be 2001  start ut1999  pick multiplayer  500 servers 75 are full  every gamemode every official map lots of fanmade maps too  wide range of skill levels on every server  you had people running around acting like idiots skilled players and ninjas teleporting around and telefragging people while blasting them with double enforcers  nonstop high adrenaline rush action arena fps at its best  wasnt too often a videogame could make me sweat but ut1999 in its prime could with how intense multiplayer could be
when you beat the first map on godlike  i felt like a god beating the shit out of blake
  and its upsetting how games are just shitty cash grabs with no soul
has anyone modded onslaught into ut99 already
  
  functional vehicles
  is it functional and not buggy
those guys at the ut99 forums are making some crazy good looking maps
  those guys  a few of them most are making barely average maps
well holy fuck someone managed to recover most of the content from the canceled psx unreal game  
  so this is a mod that runs the psx exclusive stuff on pc  mental  we need a full writeup on this
  pretty much and adding more stuff to it i feel like devs should release more stuff that never made it to the games just to see what the community will make out of them
  hmm is the psx version available anywhere id like to play it because psxs unfiltered textures and janky polygons charm me so much
  it never got released it was canceled during development as far as i know the person making the mod is one of the devs
  played through it the other day pretty good up until the part where you go into the ai fuck that shit
  so this is the only way to experience the psx game oh well
  pretty much i mean youll be able to play something that has the rarity of being canceled and later getting revived
  is it a bullshit part of the mod
  i guess you go into a cyberworld and you have to kill like 9 or so i think translucent gasbags that fire basically invisible projectiles and the stage is really narrow its a fucking pain afterwards you hop through portals to different levels with some cut content and stuff and it takes a while  i didnt know about the ai stuff in advance at first either and really it just turned me off since up to that point had been nice outdoor levels and interesting parts in vortex rikers
happy birthday ut99
utzone is 404ing  gguys
  same models  lazy bastards    playable  oh neat i checked for this like a year ago
  a girl
  bio launcher was active in the last 1v1 tournament i did on it didnt work out so good for balance    it is but to be honest its pretty good for a genesis cover by some random dude i think the genesis can do some amazing music sometimes such as contra hardcorps and thunderforce iv but lol
  in ut99 its the sniper rifle  but i do love de and shock rifles of course    this but unironically
  works on my machine  
  epic is too busy swimming in fortnite bucks
  works fine for me check again
  15 damage each pistol  broken as fuck
  even a single enforcer is enough to take down a shielded player if they dont take him down
  not a do you even liftjump joke
so i just installed ut after 8 years or so with the utglr renderer i dont have fog for example in dmfetid can anyone tell me if this is normal
xan confirmed
  wasnt there a fan game with that idea already on the works
  and then she gets raped where the fuck is the next part of that picture
  do you mean qc doom edition
which one is better and why
64 because of tighter controls and more fun tracks  super circuit is pretty much smk but better
  smk is really basic and ive always found the track designs mostly unexciting like other anon said super circuit does the style of super mario kart but much better if you dont mind not retro
the original is the king b/c the music on snes rules and n64 controller sucks
mk64 is at least playable
  smk is the worst mario kart 64 may not be the best but at least its not a mess like smk
  64  full screen
are you kidding mode 7 snes racing games were all trash especially mario kart
  smk    more tracks narrower tracks better tracks more racing finesse plus you can actually drive off the edge on rainbow road unlike in the n64 babby mode rainbow road    however the n64 version has a 4 player mode which smk doesnt have
smk is a better game for competitive play and mk64 is a better party game
  64 for having more diverse track themes the tracks are very repetitive in smk and it doesnt help that theyre all really short and 5 laps
smks battle mode is much better
  but where is regular mario kart
  i hope this is a joke
mario kart is the only nintendo franchise that actually gets better with every entry theres really no reason to play smk arguing smk is better than 64 is like arguing star fox is better than sf64
  its still fun despite being worse than mk64
which one is better
  64 is the best in the whole series and its not even close  double dash is just ugh  i like super also but its hard to get an actual human being to play due to the higher learning curve of it
mk64 by a long way smk was fun but it doesnt feel full 3d
  smk by a mile 64 was a huge let down
    now these are some hot takes
  meant for  and 
  left souless  right soul
mk64s rubberband npc speed makes the game enjoyable for me
retro answer crash team racing  nonretro answer sonic allstars racing    why does this soul/soulless meme feel like it can from some shithole like reddit
64 because this is a genre that is done better with actual 3d and they did a great job with everything
  mario kart 64 was great but i honestly think the wii version was the best most racing games screw you over with oneway rubberband ai but mario kart for the wii had it twoway even when you were losing badly there was a chance for a sweet comeback that made the races really chaotic and exciting i guess you could say it was about luck as much as skill but it was fun for casual play and i think that was the goal of mario kart
  question about what mario kart game between super or mk64 is better  hurr durr ctr  ctrfags always with this shit no matter what
  question about kart racing racing series for babies  post superior kart racing games that require some amount of skill  waaaaah ctr
  your post doesnt had anything to do with the question like all ctrfags you just came here to shitpost about your superior game without any reason to  i dont care if you need to fartcancel the whole track in ctr to win or get a decent time op was just asking which mario kart game was the best one between super or 64
super circuit is the normie filter of the mario kart games    its the only one that takes any actual skill to play
  smk  skill  mk64  luck
  man piss off you retard if this thread doesnt interest you then go fuck off elsewhere calling mk series for babies how much of a troll are you just fuck off and eat shit  its completely reasonable  you are not interested then you dont post in the thread slugbrain
  i appreciate smk both for having a lot of little charming bits with the characters like how they all make their own particular engine sound etc also interestingly it still feels the most realistic with how you pretty much have to drift to make sharp turns properly instead of just being used for mini boosts like in 64 onwards though what i just described is mostly why i think 64 is the better game it doesnt recycle content like smk has better more diverse items and stages and the easilyexploitable drift miniboosts add a certain highlevel meta to the game that other mario karts just dont have its like the melee of mario kart games
  64  blue shell    welcome to mario kart
    getting this fucking triggered over some banter about maryo kart  is the mk subreddit down
  eh well the 64 version of mk has the most fair blue shell mechanics to be fair
  as someone that can hit near world record on snes 64 is objectively better more nuanced
  its like the melee of mario kart games  exactly this guy gets it
  left woohoo buy our product look at all the cool characters you wanna play kid woohoo  right well youve been playing this game for what seems like a very long time now although those good times are only memories well be racing forever and those good times will never have to end as the golden days of the sun settle off into the distance i hope these memories will never have to disappear even though this moment is only temporary let us enjoy it for all eternity my friend
  until the arthritis kicks in anyway
  dunno i dont go there
  64 both have iconic tracks and songs but 64s multiplayer is what made it one of the kings of the n64
  one of my favorite things from 64 is the physics when you got hit say bowser has a star and he rams toad at full speed that motherfucker went flying i miss shit like that
64s rr  smcs rr
  64 because the multiplayer modes and tracks were better ghost data was cool too
  why does this soul/soulless meme feel like it can from some shithole like reddit  because its a meme from /v/
  love smk its a classic for nostalgia nerds like myself who grew up with this as their first mk    however it doesnt come close to mk64
  blatantly false
  i used to prefer 64 but i now think that smk has the best controls for any kartracing game ive ever played also the coin mechanic is neat smk is my favorite now
late 1995 fps  full 3d environments and level design  hub system  all directional mouselook by default  3d models enemies  some enemies have localized damage you can destroy parts of them  3d model props you can interact with use for jumping destroy  objectives story  driveable vehicules car and plane    why was this game so misunderstood and underrated at release and why is it still now  even quake and dn3d didnt have it by default and even then had up/down mouselook because of this game    looks like all the reviews of the time complained about were stupid things like the lack of multiplayer and no highres which the sequel added or not being able to a mouse control scheme which later on became the norm that and oh gameplay isnt like doom and was more survival oriented so apparently thats not okay
because its boring as shit
  youre just a depressed low testosterone cocksucker that cant appreciate games that dont have cutesy anime eyes
  quake doesnt play great either and if you check review conclusions all they care about and all the marketing is all about is the 3d engine with 3d levels this game did it before and no review conclusion from the time even mention it
dddduke nukem
  lol ugly as fuck nice draw distance
  ive honestly never heard of this game desu anyone got a dl link id like to check it out i love the terminator theme/style so it be neat to play an old school shooter with that design
i own a physical copy of this  i never understood as a kid why no one i met ever played it i enjoyed it
  needs a sourceport
  quake doesnt play great either
  only ever played skynet version and i loved it really amazing for its time
  ive honestly never heard of this game desu anyone got a dl link id like to check it out i love the terminator theme/style so it be neat to play an old school shooter with that design    i had this and terminator skynet when i was 12 or so back in the day the game was actually quite innovative for its day even though it still had some flaws future shock has fairly open ended map design and you could enter into any building with a textured door which would lead to some fairly big interiors future shock is almost a completely polygonal fps and yes it does have mouse look aiming which makes it one of the first of its kind the game uses bethesda softworkss old xngine engine the same engine that was later used in the elder scrolls ii daggerfall  the sequel terminator skynet was also todd howards first game as leader designer he also worked on future shock as well too        op  ive honestly never heard of this game desu anyone got a dl link id like to check it out i love the terminator theme/style so it be neat to play an old school shooter with that design      it will probably never end up on gog due to licensing but this and skynet wouldnt be too hard to find
  lmao no
  i played this some as a kid but i just barely remember it  i was a dumb shit as a kid who only played with cheats and couldnt progress much so obviously i wasnt able to appreciate the game very much back in the day    really wish there was a sourceport or port i remember trying to make it run in dosbox like a decade ago and it just refused to work
undeniably incredible on the technical level but its supposed to present a postapocalyptic world and rather than feeling desolate and abandoned the areas have kind of a sterile playgroundlike quality to them this kind of takes away from the immersion also no multiplayer of any kind is really a downside the biggest offense by far though no gun sway when walking
  what did he mean by this
i had this game still have the booklet for it somewhere i remember purchasing it at a local computer shop in some mall i really dug it it was fun but it was slow as were the enemies it had good ideas but like a few others said the execution was lacking
  but its supposed to present a postapocalyptic world and rather than feeling desolate and abandoned the areas have kind of a sterile playgroundlike quality to them this kind of takes away from the immersion    i dunno i thought it did a good job representing the future war from the movies probably one of the best representations of it in a game from 1995 though i guess that isnt saying much given that the majority of the terminator games were 2d side scrollers the weapon bob was kinda weird but the guns were 2d sprites in some weird ways it was like a smaller scale fallout 3     
cant believe bethesda game studio made this game with ancient game engine xngine
  cant believe bethesda game studio made this game with ancient game engine xngine    in all fairness xngine was new in 1995 and future shock was the first game to use it
  just downloaded it myself out of curiosity looks like theres a version 130 patch to download in addition to the game im going with the 25 meg rip over the iso    
  after playing quake about half a dozen times and playing many other old shooters id agree with him although i can still appreciate the game to some degree
  have you played the expansions to quake theyre pretty good bar one or two real cruel traps
  just downloaded it myself out of curiosity looks like theres a version 130 patch to download in addition to the game im going with the 25 meg rip over the iso        futureshock is pretty easy to get running in dosbox an if you want mouse wheel support look here         also the sequel skynet actually comes with future shock as well the boxed copy came with both games skynet was a slightly better game too as it does fix some of the issues with the first game it also has cheesy live action fmv cutscenes
maybe the only good bethesda games
  the boxed copy came with both games  untrue    however if you have future shock installed during the installation of skynet you can let it know where fshock is located which will allow you to play fshock inside skynet with its new 640x480 resolution sadly they share the limited save slots this way
  it was really hard and only ran at a good framerate at the lowest res which looks like shit its fun for a little while but starts to get old real quick its still probably the best terminator game though but it could really use a sourceport
i just beat the game and the addon    the 3d engine and models are amazing gameplay is fun due to that exploration blowing up enemies but some parts can get really annoying i had to resort to a faq twice and two more times i got stuck due a glitch that prevented me from beating the level the end of the game had a lot of in your face enemy spawns which wasnt fun at all    half of the weapons being upgrades to others it feels like half of them become useless once you have the upgrade    the addon has much better balance youre not swimming in ammo anymore for instance better level design and objectives and more varied locations as well its too bad its much shorter      if you get a crash in skynet at map transitions google and youll find an exe that fix that its due to dosbox cpu being set too fast so you can also reduce it      sourceport    why mouselook is perfect by default better than the majority of fps games from the time and the game looks and run greats in 640480
    question is would bethesda make a new game they still have the rights
demo discs promotional videos commercials flyers gaming advertising used to be so fucking cool pic related was my introduction to final fantasy 7 my mother picked this gem up at a stop and shop before we even had a playstation care to guess what i asked for christmas that year what are your favorite demo discs do you know of any cool uncommon promo videos    pic related had a full walkthrough for final fantasy 7 which even included a guide on how to get a golden chocobo and knights of the round it somehow covered the whole game in 1520 minutes and was essentially spoiler free by the time i finally got the game i had watched the walkthrough a million times and rarely every got stuck
no reading required  wat
  check out this loser dont you realize reading is soooo uncool
  lol it was a video i remember renting this way back when thought it was the coolest thing ever
  fuck yeah my brotha so did i when i got it the only experience i had was with snes there will never be such a jump as there was from 8 bit to 32 bit consoles
ok i built an emulation machine from some spare parts and i got an xbox one controller to use as the inputthe thing was 10 at a local sale and it was a blind buy    the dpad sucks ass its fine with ps1 n64 gc and ps2 emulation ie systems that use the stick but for games that use the dpadits ass    is a 360 controller still the gold standard for controllers i havent tried an 8bitdo controller i do have a wifi/bluetooth card installed    what is a good option for this
  jesus this post is fucking cancer the x1 is the definitive direction pad controller nothing has come close until ps5 copies it this thread is just a disguise to bitch about autistic dislike for the x1 the 360 was never a standard for dpad games it is literally a fucking joystick disc instead of buttons kill yourself
  ive never used an x1 controller so im not as passionate as  but i do own several dozen controllers in the quest for good emulation devices    good options in no particular order   ps3 with whatever rawmode bluetooth hack your os supports wireless or a long usbmini cable wired   ps4 with the official usb adaptor wireless or a long usbmicro cable wired   logitech f310 wired or f710 wireless   buffalo snes wired   original snes or ps2 or ps1 with a usb adaptor obv wired    i own an 8bitdo nes30 and sfc30 they are good wired but i find the bluetooth hid to be unreliable and laggy with two devices i wouldnt recommend them or any bt device for wireless play    you can often find older logitech controllers for cheap on ebay they are usually pretty good too i have a random selection of these which i got for between 5 and 10
the absolute best is the official sls saturn usb pad
  the 360 pad shitducks shot what are you on i wouldnt say the ps3 or ps4 are amazing but they are serviceable
personally i really like the xbones dpad but if thats no good for you then you could try the hori fighting commander the xbox one not ps4
  xbone dpad isnt meant for games just menus due to the way it clicks  the xbox 360 dpad is even worse for some reason its movement is restricted by the raised ring of plastic around it ive done a few mods and none of them really fix it  your best bet is roll with a ps3/ps4 controller or possibly just get an adapter of your favorite controller  i use ps2 pads for everything
  so is the neogeo controllor not meant for games because it clicks    the x1 game pad is the best modern dpad for 2d games
  lol try doing a shoryuken on it or just any motions in general
  op here and yea no i played some zelda 1 earlier with the dpad on the x1 controller and a shit ton of errant diagonals weird seeing link go diagonally across the screen
  thats what you get an arcade stick for friendo
  neogeo has mostly fighting games are you saying the control they put out for the console is no good for fighting game motions      ive never had any errant input with any x1 gamepads stop lying
anything 8bitdo is worth it if you dont mind spending a bit of cash    if you want a cheaper alternative then the buffalo snes controllers are really decent for the price
  its not possible to have errant diagonals on a microswitch dpad you goof
  well i went diagonal
  maybe treat your parkinsons instead of playing games
  is a 360 controller still the gold standard for controllers  calling 360 controllers the gold standard with their aluminum dpads  wew
the xbone controller that had plastic around the xbox logo is the best one the new one has a faulty dpad
  ah mine is newer
  x1 is shit its controller is shit  ill repeat these simple facts until you faggots stop shilling your subpar controller here  youre right about the xbox 360 controller though but at least is cheap unlike your clicky excuse for a dpad
wii u pro is probably the best controller but too much hassle to make it work for emulation
i just use my wired ps3 controller with the motioninjoy drivers to fake xinput for pretty much anything i play on pc
i got some usb sneslooking controller except it has megaman on it seems to work okay
  zelda 1  diagonal  guess how i can tell your post is bullshit
  i built shit and it was shit  shocker 8bitdo sounds like a good fit for you      in my whole summer of gaming experience something is not possible  lol
  motioninjoy    look up scp drivers for ps3 controllers waaaay less sketchy than motioninjoy and just cleaner overall
      x1  is this what they call the xbone in serbia
  no japanese 8bit pc its dpad is identical to the famicom due to that sharp had a deal with nintendo around this time    said controllers were also used on the x68000  msx line as well due to their pin out
  ah i see the sharp ekkusuwan thanks anon
  youre welcome
  i cant believe you youd me for this shit
i have a mad catz mojo basically out dated android tv console any suggestions in wireless controllers for emulators play mostly snes and nes but want to play more psx library i currently have an i buffalo controller but the cord length is just too short for my living room
  well done anon
  nice looking case what frontend/gui are you using
  ps2 controller with usb adaptor or ps3/ps4 controller with long usb cable you might have to try a couple of different ones to find which works well with android or use a key remapping app
what are some retro games that were unforgettable
tmnt 2 my brothers and me used to rent it every weekend awesome especially for an nes
    these are both on my list but swapping hm btn for hm 64 i never got to play the 64 version and i desperately want to  id add banjo kazooie
  hm64 plays wayyy different than btn i love both of them but if i had to choose hm64 is the better one i know people get annoyed with the soul/soulless meme but hm64 really has a lot of soul hmbtn also has soul but hm64 has such a specific feeling to the game that ive never experienced it from any other game
  i really dont get it the n64 version has those ugly black borders simply chopping the world in blocks they always bother me when i try it should i just keep pushing it and see if ill get used to it eventually
still play it my son loves it too
  hm64 has such a specific feeling to the game that ive never experienced it from any other game  i find that interesting because thats how i feel about btn i know btn and 64 are different games with similar characters in different roles and it has always intrigued me like theyre parallel universes or something btn is easily in my top 3 favorite games of all time and i really hope to play 64 some day   ever play m/fomt
  i would keep trying it i noticed that as pretty distracting playing it again all these years later basically use your imagination to fill in the black spaces and remember they did the best they could with the hardware given to them if i remember correctly hm64 used the memory on the cartridge to its absolute limit to the point the english translation had to cut a small amount of content just a television channel to allow it to fit      btn also has such a specific feeling for me btn felt very refreshing constantly hard to describe but a very clean feeling to the whole game n64 has this magical/mysterious quality to it i never played fomt but i wish i had is it similar to btn
if ffvii is supposedly widely considered the best then why do all game journalist sites rank ffvi the best on their top ten lists
  contrarian shills
  dont try to understand the cuckold lifestyle or you will end up living it anon
  a bangin set of tits really goes a long way in triggering consumers of soi
  (((journalist)))
  heres your problem  game journalists
because games journalists are experts in their field who have devoted their lives to understanding what makes games good and the masses are mindless sheep driven solely by what they are told to like
  vi is good but it kind of lost itself in its own story they were too ambitious in some parts and too generic in others theres no real depth in it nor in the characters they struggle and develop yes but its all too simple thus making it look fake     vii on the other hand makes almost everything right its only mistake is the battle system which makes every character somewhat equal but aside from that it has a deep story excellent character development excellent bosses and soundtrack only ix is on par with vii
  so youre telling me that 6 is the onions ff
  because some people have different opinions believe it or not
i honestly dont believe that anybody has the super famicom period final fantasy games as their favorites theres nothing to those games at all they dont have interesting stories or characters even though some very weird people pretend they do as an rpg they had a larger emphasis on scripted sequences but that doesnt equate to having a good story in fact it is honestly annoying that final fantasy essentially pioneered cinematic games and most people dont acknowledge this whereas more traditional crpgs were still doing the worldbuilding/quests thing as for the gameplay and level design theres nothing special at all to it let alone worthy of being called the greatest of all time the animations and sprites are more flashier in presentation but theres hardly any nuance or skill in the battles and every dungeons or areas is extremely simple theres no complex mazes or anything special like what you would find in some other rpgs like wizardry if you look at the super famicom ff as a whole there is only one word that comes to mind generic this is the basic template for making a derivative and mindless jrpgs there were better games before and there were better games afterwards objectively theres not much that final fantasy ever did more than take the formula of ultima and decrease the gameplay elements while increasing the cinematic elements that being said i respect the ps1 games more because they realized the presentation and cinematic elements to a much greater degree      if only that were even slightly true
  dunno i think having every character be more or less equal in combat terms is a plus you can pretty much make any party with any character imagine if say cait sith was the only viable black mage but you wanted to carry someone else because you dont like him itd drive most players nuts
  help me please im too much of a ballsucking faggot to understand the appeal of the snes final fantasy games  sorry i really dont think i can help based on your post you lack a fundamental ability to reason about games rpgs in particular and what makes them appealing to various different types of players
  yeah i think the issue is they got stuck with a dilemma they wanted to do ff5style job system that allowed you to switch around your build on the fly but they also wanted an ff6style party system with individual characters
  based great post
  cause ff6 is the better game despite not being nearly as popular
  see   thats it literally it earlier ages of the internet before now was nothing but a final fantasy vii hate circlejerk and final fantasy vi being the closest game to it was automatically held to a higher standard as a result with that said both games are fantastic for their time and excel at certain categories while failing at others
  dunno i think having every character be more or less equal in combat terms is a plus  yeah because every single character is a blank slate with zero differences it works and makes sense in final fantasy vs case not in vii where the cast is suppose to be very diverse and unique
it helps that 6 was aesthetically cohesive and didnt look like it was made by several art teams who werent allowed to communicate
  i honestly dont believe that anybody has the super famicom period final fantasy games as their favorites  you have a very closeminded viewpoint also final fantasy vs job system is fantastic and was a huge deal for its time only tactics managed to surpass it
  vii  vi  anon learn your roman numerals it should be ix best 9 is the best
  because of a feud that is about 20 years old now which was predicated on the fact that ffvii marked the transition to 3d cinematic rpgs/games that resembled movies or animation instead of the old games which were forced to convey narrative segments through their own engine staging dialogue like a manga or comic    they would have been about 11 or 12 or 18 or whatever when ff6 came out so it was their game then when other kids were 11 or 12 or 18 they played ff7 and thought it was their game so the other guys got all salty about someone else having a good time when they were obviously totally wrong or whatever    i like most of the final fantasy games
  kill yourself
  9fags kill yourselvsz
  based
  9 is okay its kind of weird that quina is the only adult in the party everyone else just angsts out and goes through constant growing pains
  ffvii is supposedly widely considered the best  no its the most popular one that doesnt mean its the best the best is viii and tactics the rest of the retro ones are horseshit well maybe not horseshit but not even close to viii or tactics
  the best is viii and tactics  8 is widely considered a mixed bag to be the best  and tactics is a different genre altogether than mainline final fantasy      op dont trust game journos they are faggots who suck at games
  (((game journalist)))  what were you thinking
  that being said i respect the ps1 games more because they realized the nongame related elements to a much greater degree  people like you are why modern games are trash please go back to r e d d i t even /v/ couldnt handle your faggotry
  (((game journalist)))  problem
fuck off jannie
  so what the battle system is all about materia its up to the player to create materia combos that will determine the battle style of each character and certain characters will have materia combos designed to work off of what you have designed other characters to do trying to shoehorn some other artificial differences on top of that would just get in the way they have different limit breaks which are more meant to be a bonus to anything youre doing and compliment any sort of materia set up its one of the better systems ive played setting up your characters is almost like building a magic deck or something i just wish the game pushed you more outside of ruby and emerald to really test the limits of how youve designed your party
    jannie works for kotaku for free
  when i play an rpg i expect rpg elements instead of getting the right deck as you so bluntly put it
  customizing your character is not an rpg element  what by building a deck he was emphasizing customization and synergy a deck has to have parts that all work together
  and im saying i dont like the freeform style i find the idea of slowly building up a characters stats/levels and unlocking various feats and skills far more interesting than just slapping whatever the hell you need at that moment in time onto a character final fantasy v hit a good balance with this i feel but suffers from characters feeling very samey at the end but thats probably the point
  and im saying i dont like the freeform style  and a lot of us do so whats your point there are thousands of games with zero or limited customization for you to choose from ffvii gives something to those of us that like to employ strategies in our team building and create crazy combos and executes it very well
  i find the idea of slowly building up a characters stats/levels and unlocking various feats and skills far more interesting  thats far less interesting since it is automatic which means less thinking and strategy involved and it ruins replay value since you are stuck in linear paths while customization invites more replay more experimentation and more thought and that is more interesting
  i find the idea of slowly building up a characters stats/levels and unlocking various feats and skills far more interesting  to add this is also built into the materia system just having a materia on its own and equipping isnt enough to have a powerful party you have to level the materia up which then unlocks new abilities as they pertain to the materia all the way up to unlocking master materia
  now hold on friend are you talking about rpgs as simulations or rpgs as a form of narrative storytelling structure with a certain tradition of underlying mechanical elements because the two are not the same thing
    dont get where you guys are getting this idea that i dislike customization i dislike customization that has zero meaningful investment and fails to define a character compare it to final fantasy v where your characters become more defined in their roles the more jobs you invest in going from a blank slate to a powerful warrior or a magical spellcaster or perhaps a hybrid of the two ill admit ffvs job system is not perfect by any stretch like characters easily ending up similar but its fun seeing how your characters are built up from the beginning to the end final fantasy tactics is what i think improved on the formula to nearperfection you can mix and match skills however the fuck you want yet the investment you put in those various jobs manage to define the hell out of your characters its very hard to get a samey character unless you deliberately do so or youre super late in the game     true there is that going for it but it still doesnt really justify the amount of characters you get either    no reason there cant be elements of both
  so you like customization as long as its within a class system not customization where anyone can be anything
  it doesnt really have to be a class system but things like skills you invest in and things like that yeah final fantasy viis style of rpg is more equip everything you need before you head on rather than build your characters up to help them face the challenges ahead
whats funny is that nomura says that ffv and tactics are his favorite ffs because anyone can do anything
  i think anyone can do anything is just one part of it the freedom it gives you is what makes your character grow over time as well
  hes completely correct though hes not saying worse gameplay is acceptable as long as it has story but pointing out that despite the gameplay being weak either way the ps1 games much stronger artistic elements make them superior all other things taken into account the older games in the series were never better and their gameplay paled compared to dq
  ffvi is ranked higher because its the last of the traditional final fantasy games so people that have a strong nostalgia or attachment to the sprite artwork and story telling of the snes era will naturally gravitate towards it    personally i think ffvii has a stronger cast of characters but a worse overall plot while ffvi has a great plot but paperthin characters with a few exceptions plus i think ffvii is a lot more subversive considering what it does with an unreliable mc
6 is the most overrated final fantasy of all time and its not even a particularly good game
  because people who have never played final fantasy either gravitate towardsd 67 or 10 7 and 10 are too popular so 6 is the go to for people to sound like they know what they are talking about ive played 7 up to costa and 6 up to jidoor in my opinion i dont like the gameplay of final fantasy at all 6 has pretty sprites and that snes nostalgia while 7 has the atmosphere and characters i dont know why i keep retrying these games the only final fantasy i actually like is xi and thats because of nostalgia give it 5 years and soon every gaming journalist will be touting 5 9 or 12 as the greatest ff ever    final fantasy is a mediocre series and would be a lot more fun as an arpg
  thats a shame but i think you should play tactics if you want to see peak final fantas  final fantasy is a mediocre series and would be a lot more fun as an arpg  oh never mind
i never liked how much some ffvii and ffvi fans attack one another theyre almost equal games in my mind
  game journalists  experts
  100 agree  jrpgs are essentially movies that you play through
   its kind of weird that quina is the only adult in the party
  i wasnt talking about their ages
  mindless sheep driven solely by what they are told to like  by journalists
  ffs this is obvious sarcasm stop falling for it  videogame journalists are just people who got their degree and suck too much to get involved with actual news or whatever so since they played at least 2 games until they hit 20 and have a p2w game installed on their phone decide to be hip and enter the cool videogame news industry there are hardly any good review/news sites rpgfan is probably my favourite in terms of writing but the scores are inconsistent af among different reviewers
  because those journalists are voicing their opinion
  viis story is entirely forgettable besides aeriths death
  jrpgs are weighed down by the fact that they feel the need to have lots of combat i think partly out of obligation and a what they falsely assume is meeting the consumers demands in reality jrpgs were only ever good for the crazy ass convoluted stories you just dont see anywhere wise thats why ff7ff10 are so fucking good the combat however is pure shit outside of boss fights i say that as a guy who loves jrpgs random encounters are mindless trash and so are encounters where the enemies are on the map mook battles are just so fucking pointless and braindead      i would love to play a jrpg that was just story exploration puzzles and boss battles
  9 is literally the least angsty ff by a million miles    zidane is just a fucking playboy trying to get some princess pussy    garnet is a serious bitch on a fucking mission    steinert is an honorable goofball who bros out with vivi and comes to respect zidane    vivi is the closest to angsty but really its more existentialism curiosity and maybe some melancholy    the rest of the cast dont really matter like yuffie cait sith questis penelo and 75 of the cast in 6
at this point these threads are preaching to the choir everyone already agrees jrpgs are worthless trash that killed gaming with progress systems
  no its not 710 all have crazy unique stories that i can fully remember to this very day
  paled compared to dq  eh at least final fantasy gives you tents to heal your mp before bosses dragon quest has you killing everything with slow melee attacks to preserve magic for bosses
  6 is basically the precursor to 7 similar mechanics and tone 7 just happened to really catch on in the west i wouldnt really call either better than one another id say 6 looks a lot better aesthetically top tier 16 bit sprite art looks a hell of a lot better than early ps1 graphics if i were a younger critic looking at both id probably pick the game that has aged better so that might be the reason
i like 6 more than 7 because i played it first
  what are you talking about just because theres traditional 3d mixed with prerendered doesnt mean they arent cohesive i think they fit quite well together
  same
  i dont see it that way at all in the late 90s to early 00s there was a lot of like for ffvii i even remember gamefaqs doing a goat game battle on their polls long ago where it came down to ffvii vs oot and ffvii won things like this however could have been one of many examples of hatred starting to brew people would see something like this and of course haters would be very angry with it and then post about how overrated ffvii is on message boards another thing that i think took ffvii down some notches was the movie and that ps3 tech demo haters seeing these things only put more hate in their hearts for ffvii    i think it was probably some time in the early 2000s years but yes it obviously did happen where you saw a noticeable amount of hate for ffvii game journalists should never be taken seriously anyways they are only ranking ffvi higher for hipster credit with their viewers its very disingenuous especially since i like vi a lot although not as much as vii i am not going to get got by these faggots though i know exactly what it is they do    these same journalists gave das2 a higher metacritic than the other souls games even though all other souls games are better than this broken game was on launch nobody should be taking these idiots words for anything
  hes talking of half the cutscenes using chibi models and the other half using anatomically realistic ones you ignoramus
  everyone already agrees   false consensus    jrpgs are worthless trash that killed gaming with progress systems  oh its that guy from /vg/ posting his usual jarpigs are bad mkay and 1cc is where its at rants again what are you gonna do next call me retardo
  its not false you go to these threads and the popular opinion agrees jrpgs suck
  several different art teams would refer to separate stylistically not medium its all one art team split into departments
  i recall reading somewhere they ran into production problems and towards the end they had to hire an american team to help with the cgi of course all ingame models were already done by then and they dont have clashing styles
i love every game from 49 barring the guardian forces in viii they dont really put a foot wrong for me
  ff7 had a different theme a skin drapped over the ff formula a more modern taken on the idea no wandering around talking to kings and shit its a company that is the primary antagonist and there was a new class added soldier fuck being a warrior or a paladin
              why game journalists are trash     reliance on the industry they cover for their revenue creates a conflict of interest criticize an advertisers game and they stop buying adspace see kain  linch  the consumer culture is dominated by fanboy mentalities legitimate criticism of babys favorite toy results in hatemail and death threats so ips that are too popular are off limits  you can watch a movie and review it the same day many games are 40 hours for this reason most reviews are only based on the very beginning of a game   the scoop mentality created by the 15 second attention window of the average internet user   outrage culture makes it so contrarianism and insulting the target audience guarantees a lot of clicks  most employees are failed journalism majors not genuinely interested in the hobby with minimal knowledge of the subject and a low skill level
  why do all game journalist sites rank ffvi the best on their top ten lists  because its a super nintendo game and super nintendo is le ultimate epic bestest retro system of all time because muh 16bit pixels smash bros and ecelebs
  smash bros  hello zoomer
  viii  the best    its my personal favorite its way too broken to be the best junctioning gfs is just fucking broken especially when you get good at triple triad and win good cards
  recognizing that smash bros plays a part in affecting opinions of plebs makes me a zoomer  either you have poor reading comprehension or you just saw smash bros and got excited to bust out the latest buzzword you learned
  the snes was legendary long before anyone gave a damn about smash im not sure why you had to do your little  le ultimate epic bestest i am silly  reduction towards a piece of plastic and circuitry that btw is better than any other hunk of plastic from its era no question
  excellent summary anon
  game journalist rank ffiv the best dude
why was he filming mario and why was mario okay with it
  super mario bros 3 was a play mario 64 is a film
mario loves the spotlight duh
  mhmm
kidnapping peach is so banal in the mushroom kingdom that its become a low budget reality show
  its part of his community service for what he did to toad
  in other words ones goodand for patricians while the other one is shit for plebs
  hes the original irl streamer and the player is his sole viewer
hes filming for bbc watchdogs rogue traders    why was mario okay with it  notice marios always running away from the camera he doesnt want to end up being nobbled by matt allwright over his dodgy pipework
lets get this straight smb 2 was a dream 3 was a play allstars is most likely a play or a reunion too 64 is a reality show smw2 is a bedtime story sunshine is a parody galaxy is a religious manifesto about the creation of the universe so basically the canon is smb 1 smw and possibly odyssey are the only ones that are real
  newest lakitu sub here
  the coins that the player collects increase health  lakijew cuts the stream short if he doesnt get enough donations
the only retro mario game that ever happened was smb1 the other games were dreams and/or dramatic retelling of the story i mean mario literally saved the ruling monarchy from an evil dragon wizard that has to make you a really popular guy in the kingdom if some plumber saved the life of kim jongun thered be a ton of plays and movies in north korea celebrating his heroism
  but thats just a theory
  oh my gosh it all makes sense now so mario is basically just like zelda the same legend told again and again with little details added or subtracted over time as the story is passed down from the generations
  sunshine is a parody  noone argues  silence is consent  /vr/ really has good taste unironically
  its a first person rpg you play the role of lakitu    that said i think the point of cameraman lakitu was to familiarize new players with the idea of a separate control scheme for the player character and the camera itself before sm64 i dont think there were many examples of 3d action games with independent camera controls most people were either used to first person where the player is both the camera and protagonist or third person action games with automatically pathed camera angles crash
  well there was tomb raider jumping flash and bubsy 3d but otherwise youre right
  of those only tomb raider had a halfway decent camera the other two are prime examples of why a standard template for camera control was desperately needed in the late 90s which mario 64 provided
  its a first person rpg you play the role of lakitu  mind  blown    reminds me of super monkey ball where youre actually controlling the stage not the monkey
  mario suffered a severe head injury after donkey kong jr
  i thought that was jumpman marios dad
  ima mario mario and this isa jackass  luigi in the background oh hesa gonna do it  so long gay bowser
    in game because this is hot news on the tv and we as citizents of the mushroom kingdom care pray4princess    as per game mechanics it is easier to telegraph the camera movements it is also why i think the c buttons are yellow
  who was filming this
  another lakitu maybe
  its like those wilderness youtubers who set the camera up and then film themselves walking across a snowy landscape and then they have to walk back to get the camera again
  odyssey was clearly something akin to those yearlong event celebrations they do at disney world like mickey and minnies wedding thats why mario is constantly wearing different outfits and the final moon is a goddamn concert
what are some other games where you control two characters simultaneously
  by that point mario was a celebrity and you cant just go around throwing bobombs at the paparazzi
find a redeeming factor
dude from leviathan is on the cover
  the fucking awesome intro theme  
i played the hell outta the halfpipe mode no way dude
  no idea why they even bothered with the rest of the game story mode was crap
  its the sequel to skate or die 2
  splitting yourself in half on the little section in the middle of the half pipe
  good title theme stage 1 theme is pretty good
  the half pipe mode was fun
  fucking awesome  kek you must also produce chiptunes in the basement of your moms house
  if you were around at the time playing nes the track was mindblowing i remember my friend got this for his birthday and he put the cartridge in and all us kids at the party went nuts for the song    nongame original chiptune music is hot garbage its only good in the context of the time and the games
  the cover art appears to depict a boys death
    i like video game music eat me
  i like video game music  so do i i just dont like new chiptunes
  so youre both fags
  now dont be homophobic
  you wish princess
i would normally hit select at the start menu nothing else was worth it

  i believe deathless is worth a look havent played it yet myself though  
  metadoom may recieve an update on dooms anniversary or close  anyone who likes the mod may want to test the upcoming update to see if its good for an actual release
missed screenshot saturday but postan anyway i added a custom hud to this secret map    i also fixed a fuckton of bugs so a rc2 will be comin
white imp  white zombieman skelemancer
cacowards are in a week what 10 wads will win
is doomstyle labyrinthine keycardgated explorationfocused level design the only good type of singleplayer fps level design
  firstperson platforming can be alright when you are given good enough control of your character and puzzles
  no but its fully viable if you dont want to make anything particularly elaborate
how can i select a map in underwater jam for quake just using the console because it starts in bloodshot and when i finish that level it loads the start vanilla map
watching the last episode of composers play with bobby prince and doom  bobby feels bad that tom hall isnt in the credits
  labyrinthine explorationfocused level design is my favourite kind of level design in any singleplayer 3d game especially if the progression is nonlinear allowing more room for experimentation and replayability
  im sure romero feels bad too
  what is this
  here you go fren  
  jimmy will probably get one hes fucking nuts
would archies be any less a pain in the ass if they had chain guns instead of their explosion attack
  if i remember correctly the underwater jam didnt have a level hub so the only way you can play the levels is through the console a lot of map jams require you to use the console instead of hubs thats why a lot if the file names for a map are just the authors name type map filenameofmap in the console and your good to go
  thts what im doing it felt weird to me because the other jams i played had a hub
  you can come out of an archvile encounter unscathed less so if it has fucking hitscan
  thatd be worse dude
im kinda surprised it took until eternal for the arachnotrons to return because they seem to be simplier to replicate than the archvile or the pes  maybe they were too simple
  its like archies from hard doom
  i thought some variant in ch could burn you with the flames with dps
  yeah a lot of the map jams just dont have hubs probably because of deadlines and other stuff
i want to make a gameplay mod but i dont know where to start any tips
hi  im playing blood for the first time is it normal that i keep running out of health pickups and getting stuck on any room with a good amount cultists or do i need to just git gud  also how am i supposed to shoot downed cultists
  hi  hi
  you dont shoot downed cultist  downed cultist shoot you    on serious note crouch and jump are your friends be mobile  enemies in blood are programmed to aim worse at moving and crouching target  also i dont know what to say about last question maybe aim at them and press fire button idk
  are you sure theyre even shootable when theyre downed no matter where i shoot they never seem to take damage when theyre on the ground
  downed  downed

  id or john romero should release a 9 level wad for doom 1 as an official freebie to remind us they arent cash cows like bethesda is turning into
  some would argue that the only one that isnt the same person is doom3guy  i dont doom slayer seems off by comparison
  doomguy is revealed to be the next dlc fighter for smash hoyl shit you did it sakurai
  so he went from cool to kooky to tired of this shit but mcfuckinlovin it anyway
  then he takes off his mask and reveals himself to be commander keen
  hate to be that guy but god i fucking wish
  more doom eternal footage and maybe a release date  if they do the former i hope for a stream like in qcon where they show like three or so bits of footage
    not this shit again
  doom slayer seems off by comparison  you too would be after years and years of demon slaying
  any bit of new eternal footage would be appreciated i have a feeling the next thing were going to see is multiplayer
    all of them are alternative versions of the same guy  doom 1 2 and 64 share the same continuity  doom 3 was supposed to be a retelling of d1 events with a plot that didnt go well due to tonal shift towards horror not being well received by most of the fans it wouldve been followed by a cod doom that wouldve been a retelling of d2 but luckily it was scrapped  doom 16 is a complete reboot that leaves the possibility of slayer being doomguy from d1/2/64 continuity    so they are essentially versions of the same guy going through same motions with each reboot but with different flavours kinda like spiderman and other superhero reboots
  sorry m8
  thatd be boring      pff git gud every hitscanner but the spider is soft and squishy as hell and theyre liable to start infighting with anything make them your first target and use cover to break their line of sight    short of ambush traps where a bunch of shotgunners pop out and youre surrounded/locked in its never that hard to get away from hitscanners unscathed
whats your favorite doom console ost mine has to be the 3do version  
  i dont think thats what he meant
are the casali brothers underrated
  then what did he mean by saying you couldnt escape hitscanners unscathed
  pff git gud every hitscanner but the spider is soft and squishy as hell  youre assuming every single hitscan encounter is the same a lot of times people love to put traps where hitscanners pop out of nowhere like in plutonia map 01 where two chaingunners appear behind you in one corridor unless you know about it beforehand youre pretty much guaranteed to get hit    theres also snipers like the ones people put in building windows common in city maps    point is a longwinded attack like the archviles flame is easier to avoid than an instant hitscan attack provided theres cover    i never said you couldnt i said less so as in less likely especially since an archvile with a chaingun wouldnt go down in one hit
  psx any day      no
  i think he meant you have time to get out of archies los chaingunners attack is instant
  i think theyre properly rated plutonia was good and it influenced a lot of wads      he stops to face you for like 10 tics before opening fire thats not a huge amount of time but its enough to react to if you pay attention
would you live in a house with the same layout of e1m1 outdoor acid puddle is a pool btw
  with proper furniture it actually sounds pretty comfy
  are you me
  ten tics is 286ms  going by this site  median reaction time is 273ms  those arent great numbers
doom 1 2 64  originals  doom 3  deconstruction  doom 2016 eternal  resconstructions
  i dont get it whats your point  sure 1 commando in close quaters you can deal with just fine but theres never 1 is there
  maybe im just really used to the doom monsters      i always back off as soon as i get hitscanners in my face making sure as few of them have me in their sights as possible at any one time
  would it be though considering the timing of when the archie attacks in between reviving dead fuckers i feel like it could make him like even more of a mini boss
  that didnt go well  it was quite well received at the time
  i got my start with wildweasals gunlabs tutorials while they do seem a little outdated in some respects they still provide some great basic advice and introduced me to decorate which is the only coding language i can really understand
  i really like the archvile as a monster because of how differently he works from all of the others    you can choose to take cover from the ranged attacks of other enemies and that can be a viable strategy but with the archvile you have no choice you literally have to break line of sight and find cover otherwise he will automatically hit you and hit you very hard  optionally interrupt his attack by hurting him but that doesnt always pan out even a full salvo from the super shotgun can fail to stun him if youre unlucky    based on this unique attack behavior alone he makes himself quite distinct and makes himself a high priority target but that he also can resurrect dead enemies even strong ones like the baron of hell or mancubus enemies which take a lot of hurt to put back down again and which can seriously hurt you if you arent careful forcing you to contend not just with the archvile himself but one of the threats you previously eliminated  archie is no slouch himself he has some serious 800hp and hes very fast further other monsters are afraid of him and will not retaliate against him if accidentally hit by his attack    hes a mean and dangerous monster that forces you into unconventional strategies and i think thats excellent  on top of all that hes fucking spooky
        i think doomguy goes from doom doom 2 then either part of final doom and/or various pwads final doom and/or the pwads being possible branches which can occur after doom 2    i always felt doom 64 never much fit with the originals
   trucking spooky  fuck she is    the sound and attacks made them the most terrifying enemies in the game fucking map11 i think it was in plutonia with the fucking maze of them made my 23 year old ass yell fuck when they all teleported out of the starting area
  hunted is one of the greatest gimmick maps in all of the iwads goddamn its intense
for anyone interested in the samsara enemy mod someone was working on i tried contacting the dev and he brought up some difficulties he had while wanting to work on the mod
  tfw waiting for a dark engine equivalent to quakespasm
  iirc people were having mixed opinions on the horor aspect the discussions of it were allover the place but whatevere
  never ever because dark mod
  doom 64 is when doom guy/slayer gets locked into a sarcophagus
  what makes you think that dark mod is that big of an obstacle towards a fully functional darkspasm
  yeah i kind of figure that new doom fits the most with doom 64
god damn i love quake ost  even though i still havent played quake further than episode 1 a long time ago
      gotcha ill check those out      yeah im going through strange aeons right now and im loving it episode 1 was fucking perfect the fight against the high prest that shall not be named was pretty fun in episode 2 and siege of pnath was great and shadows of the nightmare realm was also one i found over the summer loved the music on it
  oh come on anon dont get my hopes up thatd be fucking awesome if they did that
  now you make me want to make a quake1 map of e1m1 turned into a house i cant into doom mapping but im a /radiant/ whore
  damn this looks so cool even still i wish q3 was still alive but its impossible to find games unless its some custom server shit
no new evolution of the wad or terms podcast episodes in forever  is anything similar being produced
  is wxr still around
replying to buzzword using newfags  do not
  whats the acid room with the zigzag bridge
  that spike in late 2014 was gamergate wasnt it
  11 copy from doom down to using real acid
  yep  and 2011 was the fappening iirc  i want off this ride
  how by telling to go back to boogeyman place twice as much that sure worked out all these years oh wait it didnt do shit yet people keep doing it anyway as if that did anything other than make people stay out of contempt
  gamergate and the fappening both happened during the same summer
  shit youre right it was operation payback that got us so many in 201011
  its interesting to see that the recorded reaction times have actually gotten slightly slower over the years which is almost certainly due to changes in input / display technology
    11/10 shadows  5/10 doom game
    this should be a jam
  not opposed to the idea i honestly hate quake 1 gameplay though ive bitched about it numerous times in these threads i just like brushbased mapping since ive been making q3 maps since forever
  yeah i like quake but i actually map for unreal
  the only thing i can really remember about 2010 was jesse slaughter and captcha becoming permanent i miss the 20102014 period of 4chan it was a nice silver age
  gaming populations are also older now i imagine when i was a kid adults didnt really play games now im older and still do might have skewed the percentages older people usually have slower reaction times    might be nothing just a thought
  it was a nice silver age  more like a bronze age at best
    and im switching to quake and doom because unreal is dead in the water
  one guy uses a meme you dont like hours ago  triggers you for the entire day
  gets angry over joke smash posts  unironically uses shitty /pol/ buzzwords  has the gall to call others mad
    i asked in func_msgboard lets see if someone answer me
  being this ass blasted that no one liked his stupid smash posts
  im not the guy who posted them try again
holy fuck shut up
so what are some christmas/winter themed wads pic unrelated
  the wing commander script was changed to 3dsmax use and they showed progress    really this shit opens many possibilities for sprinting
  another one with the prophecy piranha    the piranha is scaled to the wc1ks max sprite size
  the wing commander script was changed to 3dsmax  fuck  i cant use 3ds max for shit
  everything after 2014 feels like a bronze age if not a dark age
  it was already dark by the summer of 2011 when ironic memes began to spawn if you act like a retard youll attract retards who think theyre in good company its been getting worse and worse ever since the retardation becoming more concentrated in toxicity and bitterness like a man repeatedly drinking his own piss
  its dark age already just look at what happened when moot after the shitty scandals drove him out and normies met this website via gaming media /r/thedonald and gamergate shenanigans      fappening happened earlier gamergate happened very later 2014 at most
  i know the textures are shit but heres what ive done so far but thoughts obviously still a wip mostly just getting the initial brushwork dimensions by comparing it to e1m1 in slade once all thats done ill probably start to quakeify it
  whitemare  pic unrelated
  another pic from radiant forgot how fucky all of the sectors are in doom its slowing me down not that im very fast to begin with
  i can feel the static electricity charging
  what if someone remade the doom game with the die by the sword engine  
  2014  not 2004
    not to ask stupid questions but whats going on here some kind of script was written to photograph 3d models from all the necessary angles so they can be sprited
  he fell for the blender meme
im honestly pretty amazed at how nashgore ve just works for the lack of a better way for me to describe it bugs aside of course its a beta
    ill give it a shot im into the contemporary meme style
  yeah we already had several incidents
  look at the thread    originfx games like wc1 and 2 uses 32 sprites for movement up to 62 on the windows versions using the modern patch since the bottleneck was removed    the script automates that also it can be useful for doom or even build spriting in dooms case if someone really wants to go nuts and make a fully smooth monster spriting movement with all angles
  fappening was august 2014
  confusing shortcuts between 10 different editors  there should be an iso 9001 or something
  
  sorry i just hate blender
what are some christmas mods for doom
the way nash implement compatible blood color is fucking black magic to me it works with every mod i tried
  funny how a certain someone getting paid 512 a month cant implement that huh
     pic unrelated of course
  it doesnt work with the cacos/barons/knights in vanilla because they dont have their blood colors properly defined in base code most mods do define these colors properly though ans nashs mod takes advantage of that its apparently pretty simple
  it was a game in which a younger moses was trapped in a tomb of bugs and snakes and needed to find food to continue his journey to the lord
  go for it i havent made maps in forever so im super rusty
    fuck me i thought you said christian mod  
  it kinda works for me must be another mod that fixes it
  looks like a custom enemy set or randomizer that fixed the blood definitions
  meant for 
  ill admit i understand why
  yes been trying dusteds pandemonia is just randomizes the enemies a little but keep as normal as possible it also uses the eriguns sprites and i love them
  blender isnt bad its interface is a little fucky though  28 looks to be fixing that though
  unfunny
    doom rpg canon states that doom 3 is the prologue then the 1st rpg game and ultimate doom happens
  honestly i think doom 3 works better as its own canon its very clearly a reboot      i dont really care for how the mobile rpg games interpret the canon desu
  shaping up
  goddamn i love the gritty texture style of quake even just looking at some plain brick walls here
  how are you able to see so much of the gun model if there is one thing i dont like in quake is how you can only barely see the tip of some of the weapons
  r_viewmodel_quake 1
    has someone ever tried to add pom into q1  i was thinking her about the vanilla stuff but using parallax and pbr for some stuff but keeping the same aesthesics unlike darkplaces    speaking of that    texturescom released a fuckload of medieval textures for free if anyone wants to use it on maps and such    go nuts
  the cobblestone materials are making my dick go diamonds    mainly translated into low res
honestly i like brutal doom over nash gore because you can shoot bodies into gibs i always want that in gore mods but very few do it
  could use universal gibs have nashgore overwrite the gore effects and set universal gibs to doom blood
any new vanilla maps
  20042008 golden age before the rise of anonymous  20082012 silver age before social networks really really took off decline of /b/  20122016 bronze age fappening gamergate rise of /pol/  2016now dark age
  well for real i need to sleep
is oblige is legitimate way to make a good level with some modifying
  sledge or sludge i think does it do old school style
  space llama interment gazelle expert
  god its weird how that changes so fast
  there are a few things about nashgore that irk me the blood pool is one because it just kinda scales and is incompatible with infinitely tall actors and therefor vanilla gameplay  would be way nicer imo if it had an animation that played instead  that and the rest of the decals not matching the map pixels i think theyre all scaled to 09 which is the gzdoom default iirc  anyways just bitching about something that is largely great because if not on 4chan then where
why are sfx so quiet in crispy doom
  ill try that thanks anon
any mods/wads where the enemies are all hitscanners and melee
  wwnazis bestiary is mostly comprised of hitscanners give it a try if you havent
what the shit is up with the fucky freelook on build engine games its the worst fucking combination of smoothing and deadzones
alright time to test out the berserk throwing knife  i tried applying the ripper property flag
  holy dogshit
  well they all explode in a enormous spray of gore and viscera    all but one of them who can count his lucky stars
  i guess the knife was moving just way too fast to be reliable with the ripper property hence why it missed doing any damage to that one imp
  still no evil dead / aod mod for blood  i just wanna shoot deadites on the build engine is that too much to ask
  theres that ancient aod doom  its crude as all hell because decorate wasnt invented yet but some of the levels are actually pretty good
  this melts the 700 graphics card
  an aod tc but unpolished  damn itd be great if there was a fullyfleshed out recreation of the first three movies i should really learn modding and shit so i can make the change i want to see
  when the pizza rolls are still cold inside
  actually i dont experience any slowdown with that and i dont think i paid 700 for even this entire laptop its got 12gb memory though which is nice and comfortable      could be fun if youre interested in that subject i recommend just checking the old one out for the history of it i remember i thought oh gee this is so old and cheesy it wont capture the movie at all and it doesnt very much but i did end up spending the entire afternoon playing through it    i very much encourage a new aod doom tc though thatd be cool
  
  why 1 seems like itd be better to take advantage of 2s extra assets i like that romero made e1m4b and 8b in 1 but if youre doing a larger project it seems good to have the extra options
ok how do i use the ad textures in trenchbroom
  
  doom eternal mod tools showcase    12642016 is my headcanon
      great i want to replay пoдзeмeлья кpeмля and ликвидaтop now
  doom 64 has the same late 90s angst and edge of quake 3 where hes got ptsd i think thats mostly just a trend of the time as the early 90s were more lighthearted than the late 90s especially when it came to video game stories
  what caused the massive spike in the middle of 2014
  brilliant
  this is absolutely amazing
  my fucking sides teleported away
  oh no jerryyy
  doom 16 is a complete reboot that leaves the possibility of slayer being doomguy from d1/2/64 continuity  nah hes the same doomguy as in the originals just drug into a different universe by olivia pierce after being trapped in hell
  you see its like the mounties we always get our man  
  olivia had nothing to do with slayers circumstances just attempting to contain him after hayden retrieved him if we do stick to them being the same character that does mean doomguys original universe got consumed    after 45 hell invasions within one mans lifespan its kind of no wonder it did
  most likely gamergate
  nah it was the fappening gamergate got a lot of momentum from it though
  olivia had nothing to do with slayers circumstances just attempting to contain him after hayden retrieved him  i dont think i said anything that implied otherwise only that olivia wanted doomguys sarcophagus pulled from hell specifically so she could keep him from being awakened which obviously didnt work hayden complied because he knew he could use doomguy essentially as a plan b if things went to shit
sonic generations but with different doomguys when
jesus christ i just tried out some quake 2 on ps1 thanks to my ps3 and an old disc copy lying around the controls are whack the closest i can get to a modern setup is the right stick which puts my weapon switch on the r buttons and shoot/fire on the l buttons while i move and strafe with the dpad and aim with the right stick and the enemies are really cheap the grunts can opt to fire with faster animations at seemingly random and then fire again half a second later meaning a shotgunner can blow away your health and armor in seconds almost rapidfire    one of the machine gun grunts i killed fell to the ground in a im gonna shoot you animation a door closed infront of me a solid two seconds passed and when i opened the door again its then that he started firing they can wait to shoot at you the little bastards
editor shot of that 3dr quack engine game
whats your excuse for not having finished the marathon trilogy
doom 3 and 4 being anything other than fanfic  shiggydiggy
    is this indevelopment seems like all the fun wads always are
  aleph one is garbage and i hate it
  good fanfic is better than nothing
  but anon its old the middle aged man who live in my great aunts house played it on his mac and i was like 12 then    that was 20 years ago    its so fucking olddd    and i dont think it aged well i intend to actually finish darklands at some point for instance or do that and then get in there and mod the fuck out of the bastard/remake it if i have to for realism    this may take me the better part of a decade    i think i must hate myself
  winters fury ofc
  no soundtrack
  i dont know what im doing
  i dont know what youre doing either but it looks great
  use a bsptowad program to extract the textures such as the one from joshuas quake tools  then compile them into a wad with another program such as texmex  then open trenchbroom open the face panel show texture collections and add the wad
  thanks i have another question im this guy   how the fuck do i do a glass window
    i just checked and they did actually include the texture wads for ad_start and ad_fuma not the rest though
  meh i was working on it but really disliked the level in the first game with all the friendly troops
  its hideous destructor which is publicly available maps are diabolus ex and seinfeldwad
  
i started blood first time on well done and i feel like the biggest bitch im getting my shit pushed in really really hard    no other build engine game was this hard should i kick it down a notch for my first time
  yes play on lightly broiled first unlike in doom hard mode actually increases the damage done and health possessed by enemies
so the first episode of phobos is out whats the lowdown on it
      bit late but heres the one i have    mymixtapemoe/rvkjswzip
  make the window a brush entity like func_wall and give it an alpha key with your value
and id romero and the rest of the old and new crew are still silent about next weeks anniversary
  links or it didnt happen
    
  blood is quite intense its very fun and exciting but its also quite challenging   the enemies are real mean and bullets hurt a lot caleb is a glass cannon so tanking damage is ill advised though fragile he can put out a lot of hurt thats the cannon part and hes very agile and limber  his agility and mobility is key to staying alive you need to jump duck strafe pop in and out of cover run from cover to cover while shooting fall back from oncoming groups of enemies and then surprising them with heavy firepower  this webm is a good illustration notice that while hes beset with gunfire and bombs he kills them all with just barely a scratch 1pt of damage as said mobility is key and crouching repeatedly confuses the aim of cultists also dont be afraid of using dynamite theres plenty   you are the one man blitzkrieg and son of a bitch must pay    know that in the original exe if you load a game the damage scaling gets inverted for the rest of the level meaning on easy you get hardest damage scaling and on hard you get easiest damage scaling the oldschool way to get around this problem is to save at the end of every level and just try to take the levels on as a whole which does its own to add to challenge as blood likes nasty ambushes  bloodgdx solves this problem and lets you actually customize your difficulty level
  has anyone ported the original psx enemies to pc q2
    thanks anons have a cat
well now that tumblr is going to blanket ban porn maybe ill have more time over to work on my project    hahahahaha
  can i play this with bfg edition
    nope
  i want to fpet that cat
  jery get ipad
  huh hadnt heard of this wonder how the hospital scenery comes into play
  megawad megawad megawad
im checking out brutal wolfenstein and the texture for the cell bars is displaying as a solid black box like it cant handle transparency or something using latest version of gzdoom what might be causing this issue any help is appreciated thank you
i forgot how annoying redneck rampage enemies and weapons could be
  meanwhile duke nukem 3d fits ashes like a glove
    i keep seeing these and i still cant find what mod this is
  ashes 2063 it has a version that can be played with most mods while removing the rpg / strifestyle bits
  does it add duke/rr weapons and enemies
  no those are entirely separate mods    not sure if this redneck rampage mod is the right one off the top of my memory  
  thank you
what is happening with that booster mod terminusest was making  where is kustam up to right now in gmota  when is btsx ep2 going out of public beta  drla update when  intermission when
  i stumbled a little trying to get kustams bfg figured out but i think im back on track now  once i finish that ill need to add subweapons spell cube items a berserk ring effect and player sprites  i plan on doing some other extra things for this update but those shouldnt be as time consuming as the other things i listed hopefully   im sick of my job 
  but i have
  level design is shit  visual design is also shit with all the garish clashing colors its like they really liked fireblu and decided they need more of that in their game
paging mappers  all games    when youre making an area do you successfully map it out how you want it in one pass or do you make it then kind of refine it  take the image ive posted can it start off like on the left and then as you make it and test it you morph it into looking more like the rightmost image    i can very clearly see how i want a final area im making to look but when it comes to creating it i feel like it might work better to have a blocky/rough design first run around in that and then refine it further on but im open to better labour saving ideas if theyre out there    its just that the level would look quite strange if you ran it through that program that charts sectors in chronological order as the map isnt designed in chronological order in fact the very first part of the level im likely to make last
  what is happening with that booster mod terminusest was making  workin on graphics for it base functionality for almost everything is pretty much done at this point its graphics and prettying things up
  when youre making an area do you success  nope
  when making an area do you succ  yes
  when youre making an area do you  yes
  i draw a rough sketch of the whole layout on paper first which looks like the advanced stage then in the editor i build a chunk of that refine the shape  gameplay and move on to the next chunk until the whole map is complete and i can balance  detail it fully i never get to the expert stage due to the difficulty in doing so in a retro game engine
  he cute
  thats pepe my dude
what genuine innovations did blood introduce into the fps genre when i really think about it i cant name a single one maybe i am forgetting something
  altfires on guns
  blood wasnt exactly inventive given that it was basically a massively reworked duke nukem 3d what it did bring to the table outside of an effective yet tongueincheek atmosphere was level interactivity all over the place
  marathon second one has been on win95 too
  was level interactivity all over the place  half of the game is like hedge mazes icebergs temples forests temples and generally giant textured cubes interactivity doesnt exactly shine there there is that carnival fair level sure but not every other level in the game is like it
  i dont know if it brought a lot of new things but it did a lot of things really well
  fair enough like i said blood isnt really inventive but you honestly dont need to reinvent the wheel to be fun    or dickkickingly hard
  desu id love a new blood game with a more fleshed out story not to the point where its more story than gameplay ofc im not gonna be some kotaku jackoff about it just something with more lore/detail in the world or backstory blood 2 tried something like that and as much of a mess as it was it had some neat shit that couldve worked if it were more polished
  so
   nevermind
  alright neat good luck
which of these styles of geometry do you think looks better    the first is a use of slopes on terrain and the second is using terraces im open to using both types in the same level but im wondering if the styles clash
  brush that cat anon
  using just regular textures and building platforms like these id lean towards terraces
  i was about to post screenshots of that old as fuck doom mod that looked hot as hell  this is the mod  holly
  for natural terrain i recommend sloped surfaces when you can stepped surfaces like the one in the top picture work best used in more artificial settings like techbases or cities where you expect geometry to be less round  i would advise against alternating between sloped terrain and terraces in the same level switching between the two terrain types shows a lack of internal consistency which can lead to players thinking you are lazy
  slope physics are atrocious so id go with the first one on that point alone
  this picture triggers me      thats how they look in the original
      what gets me is the cliffside part of the sloped terraces  its ok to have slopes but when you have that big flat cliffsidewell what do you do about it
  stacked 3d slopes  external 3d models its easier to import models to doom than to quake
how to i tell quake injector to load maps with skill set to 2
i finished heretic a few days ago was pretty decent even though it kinda dragged by the end    i never knew i wanted more fantasy fps games now well i guess theres the rest of the series to play
  hexen is great when its good but keep in mind getting lost can be more than half of the playtime for a first run but hey amid evil looks like a good heretic type game
  thanks anon ill keep those things in mind
  i personally like contrast not gradients in everything landscape design included just you know gradient is a glorified prettified flatness whats the big deal about it    so its terraces for me personally
  how did you like the dsparil fight did you do it on the last difficulty wanna try wandstarting the dsparils level on the last difficulty
              i think slopes inside caves looks pretty good but terraces are better for changing the players elevation that techdemo map the island for those that remember had an excellent section of caves using this method    for the record its swampy part was also perfectsad about the rest
  it was fun enough i kinda chessed with that ring that made invulnerable i did play on the default setting however im actually not that good at retro fps games yet
  autoexeccfg  skill 2
is there a doom 3 mod that disables the view change when you get hit by enemies its annoying as fuck
  well basically at the last difficulty that fight becomes a sort of a puzzle thats pretty fun to solve in my personal opinion you just might wanna keep that in mind for later maybe youll replay ep3 one day and maybe youll wanna see how it plays on the last difficulty    also heretic in general is one of the fairest retro fps games there isnt a single ranged hitscan enemy that can damage you instantly from a distance that is in the game so it plays very well on the last difficulty which just makes all the projectiles and monsters faster there isnt respawn or anything  like in doom or duke it just makes the game faster and tenser
  dont get hit duh no seriously thats the only way to make this particular game  and its leveldesign  shine if you intend to tank it you might just as well not play it it will just be a monotonous and boring slog
  chainsawing it is fun too youll take some hits but youll get good at dodging eventually
  i feel like slopes would only look right if the entire thing was made up of slopes not just the very top of it
i always felt bad for tormentor667 as while he is an absolute machine when it comes to mapping i just never got into his maps    utnt was alright i guess but from a technical standpoint hes amazing but a gameplay standpoint not so much  im considering donating to realm667 though as its great for resources
  dude im not trying to tank it i just get hit every once and awhile like any normal player does and i dont see how trying a nodamage run on my first playthrough would make it more fun
is there a way to lock a selection in x or y while dragging in the 3d viewport of trenchbroom
  and i dont see how trying a nodamage run on my first playthrough would make it more fun  you see doom 3 is a peculiar game in that for the most part it has extremely little space to properly evade projectiles thrown at you so little you just cant strafe or backpedal into a random direction because youll just step into a wall  and subsequently catch the projectile you were trying to evade in the first place so in order to do nodamage you need to construct and constantly update a sort of a mental map of your most immediate surroundings so that to account for every bit of free space you have around you for your disposal so that to still have the opportunity to dodge blindly without looking  knowing that there is a bit of free space to the leftbehind of your current position/orientation if you consider taking damage acceptable and you dont try to come out of every situation unscratched this layer of gameplay where your every single step counts just completely falls through it just vanishes without a trace and its just the one single thing that makes doom 3 more or less unique and capable of standing on its own gameplaywise i know just a single another game that also heavily coerced the player to construct that sort of mental map of his immediate surrounding so that to have the ability to dodge blindly where there was almost no space to do that bungies pathways into darkness but thats another story    point is genuinely trying todamage doom 3 in particular is a very peculiar experience that i think is worth being experienced
doom 3    what bothered me most looking back was the wimpy weapon sounds i heard the machinegun best described at somebody holding a playing card into spinning spokes on a bike wheel
  the hard and very hard modes in blood are for coop    they dont just add more monsters they add more monsters and increase enemy hp accuracy and damage while decreasing reaction times cultists start throwing bundles of dynamite instead of sticks    play blood on normal if youve finished duke on hard or shadow warrior on anything above normal if you havent done that try one of the easy difficulties
are there many levels out there that are totally linear  like you never go back to the same spot twice
  not just porn it bans heretic mapping updates and doom eternal concept art
  carmarck will absolutely not bother doing anything he might tweet about it if somebody reminds him but he doesnt seem bothered about revisiting old projects    romero i could see doing something  maybe a promotion for blackroom if hes still working on it
  lock horizontal move axis tab cycles the move axis locking for x or y icon in the lower left corner highlights the locked axis  am i being memed here tab does what it is supposed to do changing focus in the interface
    furthermore when moving objects on the xy plane in the 3d viewport or on the view plane in the 2d viewports you can restrict the movement to one axis by holding shift  nevermind im a brainlet
  their dumbass algorithm is kind of spontaneously tagging as nsfw anything which could almost look like something vaguely lewd if you slathered vaseline over your eyes and squinted
  theyve used the same basic process for finding porn for the last thirty or so years looking for an abundance of peach/orange/pink tones in an image    theres probably more to it than that but this probably looks exactly like a dick to shit like that
is it me or have a lot of servers been dying recently i look at the multiplayer list and most have one player and its just a bot    games like shotgun frenzy and complex invasion used to be packed with people playing
  doom multiplayer will probably pick back up if zandybam gets a major update i wonder how much of a gamechanger zscript would be in regards to multiplayerspecific mods
  730 am est on a tuesday
  this is the first thing i have read that made me consider playing doom 3 nicely written maybe ill pick it up on a sale at some point    have you tried desync   linear game each level is a sequence of arena encounters will not scratch the exploration itch but the arenas tend to be interesting places to fight i found it to be mostly about movement and situational awareness and had a lot of fun with it  it sounds like desync is faster and a bit looser than doom 3 you want nodamage runs while keeping the pace up to get the highest score the arena itself is also a formidable enemy at times pic very much related i havent played it for a while except to take that screenshot but i still love the game for doing its thing    apologies for rambling on about a game that is definitely not old enough to be retro i may have gotten a little overexcited
underwater jam  pressing the 9 key will give me all weapons    what why    ishs map is a clusterfuck that starts out with the thunderbolt to which i lose access apparently despite having ammo for it
  don forget you can avoid some attacks by ducking i dont know if any other fps used this the same way
  looks like hammer  radiant
  why are you jews so awkward
  thank you both for your compliment and your recommendation it was an interesting writeup about the game i havent heard before ill make sure to take a look at it eventually  on a sidenote pathways into darkness is very much worth taking a look at as well despite being ancient it is a game that managed to age exceptionally well despite having been made by effectively three persons that having been said the emulation is sadly a fair bit of a bitch and other than possessing a fairly modern mac for which there is a sourceport for there is currently no way around it emulating pathways through basiliskii is more stable on the other hand emulating it through the sheepshaver will allow you to emulate 20 version of the game the only difference is in textured floors/ceilings which are not terribly impressive maybe even a bit of an opposite to that and more importantly demo 20 to the game which is pretty based in itself and serves like a really nice epilogue to the game actually by choosing the correct version of system7 you can set up the emulated system in such a way that youll be able to use the exact same hdd file with everything set up both in basiliskii and sheepshaver depending on what youll want to emulate  also2 when checking out doom3 be sure to pick up the original version of the game not the bfg remaster it has some well caveats
dont mind me just being the only good nonnintendo castlevania game
lament of innocence is legitimately my favorite castlevania you may now pepper me with your slurs about my shit taste
   rondo is bad now  ok
  rondo  sotn  bloodlines      i will unironicall defend the n64 and ps2 castlekino games and die on that hill
  what goes through the artists mind when she draws these pretty boys
  say what you will leon is the best dressed belmont
  i love you unironically
is chronicles the new meme game
  yes hipsters who are tired of hearing about how easy rondo is and were at first excited for its rereleases are now disgusted it got them at all and that normalfags know all about it so theyve since attached themselves to a laterelease ps1 remake of a x68000 game that normalfags wont possibly give a shit about for the next ten years at least in that time expect the meme to go strong
  i like both this and curse of darkness even if the latter felt emptier than the first one  the way i look at it is that loi and cod are stiffer dmc games set in the castlevania universe  also not retro
  x68k was my favorite before the remake was even revealed just because a game is good does not make it a meme
    sure it was
  bbut i liked it before it was cool im not a hipster
    go ahead make the assumption that people like games based off of some kneejerk reaction to whats popular at the time i wasnt excited about the remake because believe it or not ive already played these games years prior instead of hearing about them for the first time from a remake its sad that /vr/ has stooped so low that the idea of researching games independent of current trends to find something that you like must be impossible
  rondo and sotn exists you imbecile
  literally the only classicvania i never played
super castlevania had the second best soundtrack of the series with sotn being the first
  best vampire killer version
/vr/ has gotten so fucking contrarian that they choose the shittiest classic castlevania as their favorite  congratulations
  nobody calls the adventure their favorite
  your taste sucks bro
  this is such a nonsensical opinion this game sucks and this board only likes it to be contrarian
  go ahead make the assumption that people like games based off of some kneejerk reaction to whats popular at the time  i will because thats exactly whats happening in chronicles case
  its sad but its true ive noticed a sharp increase in conversation about the x68000 version recently its not even that fucking good
  gameboy games arent real games anon
while it is weird that its getting so much attention here lately ive always liked it a lot so im happy about it
  theres a dedicated shitposter here that hates iv and loves x68000 he has made countless threads about that game i guess he got bored of the recent rondo vs symphony shitposting and decided to go back his old ways
ywn have as good of taste in castlevania games as australiakun
  except for wario lands those have aged surprisingly well
  me too but alas now we are considered memers
  ill say this much im very happy that smash isnt going with this simon design
ivx68kbloodlinesdracula x snesrondo
  cv3 cv1 rondo iv dracula x x6800 bloodlines cv2
      
  holy run on sentence batman
  nintoddlers cant handle the bishy
  the bishi is the least of it outside of cv judgement thats simply the worst belmont design
  holy ad hominem noargumentman
  fuck outta here fujoshit
  i hate kojimas trevor design more than her simon though that is bad too
if you want to be contrarian at least say the best one is dracula x for the snes at least that game is good
  muh feminine dick
people on here complain about scv4 being too easy and champion this despite this also being piss easy
  dracula x for the snes at least that game is good  this guy gets it i think dracula x might be my favorite castlevania if it werent for how infuriating dracula can be like hes the final boss and should be harder than everything else in the game but goddamn someone got carried away ive been knocked off platforms by his second form so many times its not funny
wow this game have gone up in price i remember i bought this from a friend for 10 in 2010 or 2011
  trevor is alright not great but alright at least hes fully clothed though his netflix series design blows it out of the water
  not retro but i almost agree with you leon is definitely my favorite belmont and the lore/story of loi is my favorite in the series
  post your 6loop nocontinues clear
  uh smash is full of bishies starting with link  thank god they went for classic simon though based sakurai
  seems like a pretty rave review why only almost agree
    shut up nerds
  mfw i used to dress like an edgelord with a trenchcoat and had bishie hair in the early 00s  shit was rad back then and its actually so corny love it  simon is classic never gets old
  only because konami insisted to kojima that she stay with simons canon design and not try to embellish it
  lament of innocence is legitimately my favorite castlevania  nothing bad with that loi has great characters music and story combat isnt half bad either and i like all the little nostalgia touches here and there its my favorite 3dvania
   i would fuck this man
  yeah dracula is a good lay
  not worth that price either only reason it goes for so much is that it was released so late in ps1 life cycle and barely anyone bought it  my sister got me a copy as a birthday present when i was like 12 wish i still had it its a decent game but not worth rape prices
all the classicvanias are good in their own ways even 2     however 3 is still my personal favorite
  this passes for a non shitpost receiving unironic praise on /vr/ now  casual hour pathetic
  this is a lowquality post
  i did loops 2 and 3 on a single continue the only hard parts are the rising water in stage 2 which is piss easy with the stopwatch and that one jump in the last stage where you have to be right on the edge of the platform
  superficial elements can only carry a game so far
  duck and the knockback wont happen
  yeah but duck  whip  knockback in full fucking force  plus theres the jumping to another platform when he gets above you and adjusting yourself on the platform you land on just right so if you do happen to get knocked back you wont fall off so staying ducked at all times isnt viable at all times  then theres the damage his fireballs can do if you get out of rhythm with your axe throws  or the damage the lightning attack can do if you find yourself on the same elevation or higher than he is so if you do manage not to get knocked back he can still just straight up merc you  ive beaten the game like 5 times now but its a hard fight man  _ツ_/
  haunted castle  how is this game
  i think dracula x might be my favorite castlevania if it werent for how infuriating dracula can be  eh once you get the hang of it its one of the easiest dracula fights in the series
  the worst  makes the adventure looks like castlevania iii
  once you get the hang of it its one of the easiest dracula fights in the series  thats a lie i mean you can easily enough manage it with the axe once you learn it but cv1 scviv rondo and bloodlines all have easier dracula fights
have you heard of castlevania symphony of the night theres a version of it on the psx playstation 1 perhaps youd enjoy it its like castlevania but you get more weapons than just the whip and there are fun rpg elements added to it lots of exploration which really improves the fun in a castlevania
  heres the correct picture
like the arranged versions music and effects  hate simons gay sprite     reeee
  i think you can choose which soundtrack to use by holding l1 and r1 when starting the game something like that
  the platforms set up the perfect axe throwing distance for you height differences makes it way easier to duck/jump his projectiles 2nd phase you just have to dodge like 2 attacks and then hes dead shortest and easiest learn to not jump to your death
  but the other dracula fights are still easier  learn to not jump to your death  im literally not you faggot
  conan simon best simon
  avoid doing 1 big mistake vs avoiding a long series of tiny mistakes  _ツ_/
  i like armored simon best and feel christopher should be the barbarian one
  feels like a chinese knock off hardly fits in the cv brand at all
i picked this game up from electronic boutique back in the day i took the bus to the mall several towns over with 50 in my pocket and no idea what was available to purchase i stumbled across this and megaman x6 which were 20 each this was the year 2000 i believe i got a lot of enjoyment out of it it was a visual and audio upgrade compared to cv4 and yet a step down in the gameplay department anyone else have a normal fucking experience with this game that doesnt amount to shitting on it or calling those that like it hipsters i just wanted to play video games
  and yet later games reuse its music constantly
  the arrange version feels kind of cheap but the original is stellar
why do castlevania fans always have so many hot takes can we just enjoy the world without needing street cred
  the postchain was about haunted castle not chronicles
  just kill me now
  no one complained about the music  thats like saying ii isnt a bad game because it got bloody tears
  can i play the original version with barbarian simon in chronicles
  yes though itll still have the arrange versions viewwindow and hitboxes
  at least x68ks bosses arent all completely braindead like ivs and your whip isnt op as fuck either
shh john morris can hear you all talking we dont want to upset him with this heresy
  more like john boreis
  lament of innocence harmony of dissonance and bloodlines are the best castlevanias    also the first casltevania that one is really good
    the shewolf bro     medusa was no joke either
  harmony of dissonance  why do you think so
  fag
  at least x68ks bosses arent all completely braindead like ivs  to be quite honest most castlevania bosses are brain dead just look at cv1 cv games are about the level design not so much the bosses  still i love x68k but  hp refill herb  what the fuck
not better than this 
  as if metroidvanias werent enough we got gowvanias too
  the only one that requires effort to beat is the wolfwoman
  you mean the x68000 original right
  for chris i go by the comic which makeshim a bit more of a gentleman
  she
  i bought it off psn on ps3 for 510 i enjoyed it one of the only retro cv games i actually beat i felt like a fucking genius when i thought to myself if i kneel in front of this alter i bet itll give me health and i was right
for the next five years you only get to play games from the third fourth or fifth console generations  what do you choose  what games do you think youll be playing most  
  dont need 5th 3rd and 4th are all i play and all i anticipate playing for the foreseeable future  i only need genesis and nes games but tg16 are nice to have  give me all arcade ports a few good sports games that arent tied to a particular time or season and some puzzle games that dont have gimped translations and keep the jarpigs to yourself  yeah im good im good
  for the next five years you only get to play games from the third fourth or fifth console generations  so basically every worthwhile console game
im collecting a lot of fifth gen imports at the moment that would be my choice even though i would miss the sega mega drive deeply if we include pc into that mix it also incorporates some of the finest games from the mid90s to the early00s you really cant lose here
  the top three are the best systems of their respective generations and have more than enough to keep you occupied for 5 years
the worst console and games library on that image is the nintendo 64      debate me
  i wont ill say youre 100 right
  29 voters and no one has voted for 5th   give me ff46 and mmx along with sonic 23k all day
  suck to be you little bitch i have a whole room full of shit i can play whenever i want
  honestly i think the sheer number of games available is enough to tip the scales towards the latest of those generations      29 voters and no one has voted for 5th  noone has voted for third most people voted for fifth followed fairly closely by fourth
  howd i fuck that up
  for the next five years you only get to play games from the third fourth or fifth console generations    thats been my game plan going forward for the past 7
  sounds like heaven and i couldnt even possibly tell you what games i will be playing because i will die before i finish my backlog
  the newest game that i play was legacy of the duelist for pc besides that all i have done is playing retro games and maybe some not retro like castlevania or dragon quest i was thinking of getting a ps4 for dqxi but the switch version could be the definitive version so i am waiting for that one  i would pick the 5th gen for the saturn and playstation platformers and jrpgs on the ps and fighting games on the saturn name a better pick
  turbografx16 exists
  hating on the pcengine    fuck off fagwad
  ill finish all my favorite ones from the nes up to the 64
  5th  ill happily play ps1 games for 5 years
  not hating you sensitive fag just saying  n64 at least had some genuine great games that you wouldnt find anywhere else theres nothing that turbo had that snes or genesis either never got or never had an even better alternative
ps1  nes  genesis  snes  n64  saturn  tg16    i never played any master system games so i cant rank it
  patrician tastes  nes  genesis  tg16  snes  ps1  n64  saturn  sms  the sms wasnt a bad piece of hardware but its game library is mostly cancer
  i could easily play just genesis games for five years id be less happy about only playing psx games for five years though
  the one with the neo geo
this thread seems a good argument for adding 6th gen  overwhelming majority voted for 5th gen games and 3th got way less votes than 4th  is /vr/ ready to discuss ps2 and ngc
ive been playing a lot of 3rd generation games lately so id choose one of the others
  fifth gen hands easily there are so many games i havent played from that generation and it is the most varied when it comes to gameplay and themes
    it never will and zoomers like you will always be disliked fuck off this board forever
  no  i wish i was younger
  master system  turbografx
  ps1  or  saturn  genesis  snes  n64  tg16  nes    rationale behind this is that while the saturn is overall superior to ps1 the ps1 did have two revolutionary titles in tenchu and metal gear solid if not for those two id decisively give it to the saturn    genesis and snes is another close contest but i have to edge it out to the genesis for its superior action and shooting libraries n64 is meh tg16 has some diamonds in the rough and 8 bit videogames are barely videogames
  oh forgot the sms i would give it the edge over the nes only for phantasy star besides that its not a good console
  i am capping this comment for the inevitable 6th gen soon this board is stale and the amount of stuff to talk about has long been dead so dead that we invent new topics daily that are hardly /vr/
  did you even graduate bro saturn reeks
  no  i wish i was younger  not knowing how to green text  4chan is the last place you need to be let alone /vr/
  we talk about remakes and romhacks   because who doesnt like the steam versions of ff with mods
  oh no the sonic game sucks what a terrible console
  5 years is a long time but id go with the saturn there are so many saturn games i havent had the chance to play and lots of ps1 gems that i didnt have much time with lots of rpgs and tactics games and shmups on those systems too and n64 has some of my favorite replayable games so id be fine with that too shame dreamcast isnt an option     i do have a lot of nes and genesis and snes games to go through but ive been doing that most of the past year so id be fine taking a break from that and changing gears ive beaten every castlevania classic anyway and ninja gaiden and shinobi and contra games this year so thats been pretty fun for me i also finally played through shining force 2 and shining in the darkness i have to admit that 2 is better than shining force 1 lol but yeah id probably go with 5th gen just because so much of it is unexplored for me and because of the thousand games available on saturn and ps1 that i want to play and havent yet   lol nice cherrypicking
  yes but its still good  i havent actually played a sega master system though so of the other onesyeah
  rationale behind this is that while the saturn is overall superior to ps1 the ps1 did have two revolutionary titles in tenchu and metal gear solid if not for those two id decisively give it to the saturn  i like the saturn a lot and enjoy its library much more than the ps1 but this is just delusional bro  ps1  saturn  n64 and its not even really up for debate people can like different libraries more than others for me its saturn  ps1  n64 but as far as objectively things go the ps1 was the best there  also disagree with you on 8bit but i do think most zoomers would find 16bit more palatable tg16 actually had some great games if you include imports rondo of blood comes to mind
  what do you mean by objectively better this is all opinion the only thing you can say objectively is that the ps1 had more games from there everything is subjective    i find that between the jrpg srpg fighting and shooting genres the saturn is the clear winner over the playstation whereas the playstation wins in 3d action racing and miscellaneous titles that never made it to the saturn due to its early end in the west such as thps it also just so happens that the two most important 3d action games of that generation are playstation exclusive i dont think im being particularly unfair here the ps1 was seriously lacking in many genres in spite of having so many games released for it    also im no fucking zoomer lol its just that 8 bit console games are largely a miserable experience and the only reason anyone still cares about 95 of them is nostalgia an entire generation of severely cut down and/or totally botched ports from arcades and more powerful computers of the era unplayable abortions churned out to cash in on the craze and the odd exception to the rule that managed to get the most fundamental of things such as controls right 16 bit games were a huge leap forward both mechanically and aesthetically anyone who says otherwise is a delusional nostalgia fag who cant get over that videogames did not peak at smb3
  give over you cant have the audacity to say the saturn had the better jrpg lineup when the psx was jrpg the console
  where is the greentext in my post faggot  i dont see any meme arrow check your eyes  also you are ironically using it wrong  4chan is the last place you need to be let alone /vr/  what about you read rule 6 of this place  you are adding nothing except showing your stupidity
  quality over quantity i didnt care for a single ff on the console though ix was more up my alley than the others vagrant story and star ocean 2 were my favorite ps1 jrpgs but i cant say that either of them hold up to panzer dragoon saga thats not to mention the superior saturn versions of grandia suikoden smt etc    i use the same logic when weighting 3d action games between the two i like burning rangers for example but it isnt half the game that tenchu is
unused super metroid enemies
  those would make really cool puzzles if you could richochet off them with a diagonal shot
castlevania iv was a completely different game at one point    
i just replayed cbfd and its mediocre and gimmicky i really wish we got this instead
  really wish this were realized i love spooky shit especially when zelda did it
  the beta version  the beta  cringe but yeah that must have been pretty early
  this is still my /vr/ holy grail they showed off new footage of this game like a year or two ago for one of the rare replay videos so prototypes definitely still exist
how about interesting prototype versions which you can actually play this version of mickeys magical quest has different graphics unfinished placeholder levels musical differences and other things apparently it is or is very close to the version which capcom demonstrated on the show floor at summer ces 1992 around 6 months before it was released anywhere    
a prototype/sample version of rockman 7 which was dumped several years ago also unfinished different graphics incomplete levels    
two different prototypes of rockman x2 the earlier one has a number of differences from final like different graphics very unfinished xhunter stages one in particular has a rather detailed tile set which differs entirely in style from the finished game apparently placeholder enemies used instead of as of then unfinished enemies things that were still in the conversion process from x1 and some small animations which were removed from the final game it even has some graphics which got fucked up in the final game but were actually correct in the early version the later prototype version has sigma directly mention zero being dr wilys creation instead of the slightly more cryptic reference in final    
  this part didnt change much besides teh texture and the models from the graves and the poe    the terrain is pretty much the same
i think somebody on /v/ said their friend had a spaceworld demo of mario 64 but afraid to dump it or use it in case it gets erased  they are probbaly lying but its worth noting
  n64 prototype carts spontaneously erase themselves if you play them  i wish that meme would die for the good of everyone as best i can tell it originated from people reading about special rare the company development carts which had to be hooked up to a computer to send it rom data while the cart was running on an n64 and as such are rendered blank when the console is turned off or something to that effect your standard runofthemill n64 prototype carts can be played and dumped just like any other n64 cartridge    also that guys full of shit probably some 14 year old betakiddie
  since 1996 ive scoured the internet for some form of playable oot beta demo does such a thing even exist id literally pay money for it
  i have one right here just email me the funds and i will get it to you
  i do really hope that the crash bash demos in spyro 3 and the demo discs have way more beta / cut content inside than whats currently seen with the cheat menu let it be early menus models or even cut minigames
  mfw learning you could play crash bull full with a spyro 3 disc years later getting crash bash  oh well
action52 has a shit ton    
  id go so far as to say the whole cartridge is a beta that they sold anyway
  show me some better content besides posting the same oot crap
    the rumor is that it was around 80 done hopefully rare will release what was finished of it someday
  marios beta voice  what were they tinking
  is that a radar in the upperright weird they took that out
  whats fucking spooky about it the shitty graveyard or the even shittier poe
  that looks like the ff7 snowboarding mini game but shittier
whats the point of this thread when everyone involved knows about tcrf
  neat
  not him but the bigger more built poe gives him more of an intimidating presence and the empty early 3d setting especially with the fog makes it all the more ominous
  whats the point of this board when everyone involved knows about retro games
  whats the point of any thread when every image can be found on another site what a dumb question
  i dont get it they changed zeldas face
  this should be  thpsbetawebm
    neat
  i dont think it can be erased just some cartridges were like that    hes probably lying but i dont really understand all this ive got a beta bullshit    thats only cool when youre a kid
  me too    god that would be a dream come true    id like to play the multiple betas and stuff
  what is this mario 64footage ive not seen yet where got you it from
hopefully we get the spaceworld 1999 demo of earthbound 64 at some point ive scoured the internet for any information and screenshots and i think ive found just about all that there is to find recently i saw some video of a spaceworld 1999 attendee recording the earthbound 64 trailer that was playing on the tvs and while flint is riding the porkbean in the desert the pig turret makes a sound while firing its cannonball that ive never heard before apparently brownie brown had the demo cartridge to use during development of mother 3 so its probably still out there somewhere
  theyre placeholders from a warner bros library
  probbaly one of these        
looks like the 3 stones used to be metallic anyone have better quality
  this is giving me ninja golf flashbacks
    was this going to be a fatality for him or something
  through a room
  damn glad they changed that jump
i recommend looking up some of the cut content from halflife theres some interesting stuff cut from it
   i believe these were used in some sm hacks i saw them in the smredesign before the hack drove me insane
anyone have any beta footage of dorry or hazy maze cave    the official guide says she can eat you so it must have been changed real late if it was ever possible
  le scuttlebug xd
  and a stable
  you will never ever play a prerelease version of smb3  feels batman
  gotta agree that spinny jump would have gotten old perfect for those propellery dudes
  well get to play it once the gravy goblin hoarding it dies of a massive heart attack
    first party nintendo shit pretty much never leaks though it was a miracle when the pokemon gold/silver spaceworld demo leaked
  tfw there was a romhack that reimplimented all the cut graphics and obstacles  cannot fucking find it like it never even existed
  id be surprised if anyone has one outside of maybe a former nintendo employee and if anyone does theyre likely japanese and therefore even less likely to dump than any obese western collector    i was going to agree but it really isnt that unheard of there are a handful of different dr mario builds one of the original fds zelda one of mario paint one of yoshis cookie that sound fantasy game f1 race and a build of us smb2 there was also that early version of super mario kart but i do not think that has been dumped sim city nes was also found i definitely get the feeling those space world demos came from some more direct source than prototype carts for whatever thats worth
    some of those games had other companies working on them that could leak them
was this ever dumped or is it still in the greasy clutches of some fatty fat fuck    
  that thing reminds me of a necromorph
  a lot probably comes down to how aggressively the companies or in this case nintendo promoted the games to magazines and in what form they were presented from my understanding a lot of prototypes were likely things sent to stores or magazines for preview or review     and just finding prototype carts isnt always enough  i know a lot turn out to be final or very near final like not long ago a super mario land 2 legit prototype cart was found but the build was just the final game a cool collectible no doubt but just the final game before it made it to production i have a tennis gb prototype cart that was a similar deal  i dumped it and it was the final game
twisted metal black sequel never ever  pic related was the carnival before stripped down for tm lost
    pretty much all nintendo and rareware protos tend to be extremely close to final build
    this game seemed kinda overly ambitious i wonder if thats why they scraped it
  i dont know but its one of the games that will have the stupidest reason for not being dumped since its not even the full original build but something that was hacked in by the owner in order to even display characters or bars on the screen apparently it was saved on ram cartridges half of which died distributing it to the public will only bring forward restoration projects which the game deserves because its a fucking neat concept with lots of style
  maybe nintendo didnt send out too many early build carts to publications for preview instead only sending out promo screenshots and blurbs perhaps only distributing proto carts once the code had been finalized or 999 finalized and the retail carts just not yet manufactured either that or they were just very strict about having everything returned after use     i know theres one cartridge with a twinkle popo version of kirby out there that would be cool to play
  wait a minute that jump is what luigi has in 64 ds
    im pretty sure theres data in perfect dark for missions that got cut
  they also have a model of the cetan not sure if its in the game file or was ever meant to be
  in some other universe sakurai is still trying to live down his one shitty action figure fighting game
  mickey mouse  the magical quest  starriing mickey mouse  i wonder if you played as mickey mouse in this game
  well thats one of my better guesses one of my other theories is that it later became twisted metal headon since i noticed a few familiar vehicles shown pic  vid related    heres some spicy footage of a very early build of harbor city  
    the shower was supposed to have stop n swop functionality
  god damn it why do we miss out on all the cool shit if they had just used memory cards this stopnswop shit couldve still been done fuck
    they couldve made about 4 decent size levels out of that
  half life 2 beta looks better than the end product   half life 2 could have been a better game  half life 2 could have had more bosses and enemies and levels
  where the hell was this preview shown it looks like one of those nintendo power vhs featurettes
  what is that dog image in the bg of the title screen
  fatty fat fuck will never dump it and when he dies his mom will throw it out with the rest of his trash so she can finally have her sewing room back
  well it was talking about sales so probably a preview tape sent to retailers
  nights creator got stingy and sega japan killed the project
  holy fuck i want to play this
  sure and valve could make videogames
  that happened because he was showed an old demo which uses the nights engine this one was coded from scratch
id pay good money for the mario 64 beta
  i heard that the way these guys moved in the beta eventually became captain falcons moveset in the original smash
what do you think it did
  yellow blocks  my guess is since some stars are found in yellow blocks that maybe the idea was to have some yellow blocks that needed to be filled in by pressing the switch
  the fuck is tcrf
  the cutting room floor a wiki dedicated to analyzing hidden and other unusual content in retail games like regional differences and documenting prototype versions of games
the southern half of the map in plok is so empty because there were 3 cut levels just before the final world after rockyfella you can get to them with cheat codes but theyre just glitch cityesque garbage data     i might contact the devs about it see if theres a story attached to them their previous game equinox had a shitload of cut content turning what was intended to be an isometric zelda clone into a simple dungeon crawler
    i wonder if we will ever get a proto of goldeneye from when it was a rail shooter
what happend to all mother 3 64 assets they still exist or got lost a long time ago
    probably locked in the nintendo vaults with the mario 64 beta and ocarina of time beta first party nintendo shit pretty much never leaks
  yeah well since upper management problems pumping money on warhawk working on a psp game that was later canned could lead to its downfall shame because it looks fun
  nintendo power were so full of shit
  metallic    or perhaps just stonecolored
  why did they decide to make it edgy
    they thought it was too similar to the other games they had coming out at the time
  thought you could find some of the time with a standard cart and game genie    but they took forever making that engine and threw up all kinds of stages doubt there ever was a betacart
  yes he was supposed to lop your head off with that katana also goro was supposed to get one where he smashes your head between his hands this was later given to jax in mk ii    no idea why they got removed
  i would love any x1 beta leaking but i would absolutely lose my fucking mind if i could so much as just once play a build or builds with white city xs early armor design and rx and ry
  thinking thats what x would look like  what retards
  except thats apparently actual capcom art it was used by two different magazine gamepro as shown above and gamefan here     and capcom had a blow up armored x at the 94 winter ces that looks in between the art used in magazines and final see pic
  xseries prototypes are very rare i wouldnt hold my breath for anything as early as the build with the daylight city ever surfacing im aware of a few prototype carts of the original rockman x and two of mmx one of which was apparently final but im always on the lookout for more there was one which apparently turned out to be different from final which was sold on ebay a couple years back but the seller didnt seem to know much about it and was testing it on a pal console so it kept triggering lockout or something     had i known for certain that it had some differences i wouldve definitely purchased it and dumped it if i remember correctly theyd already updated the life bar to the x icon as opposed to the p so i doubt it contained anything too spectacular some rdditor bought it and i think said some music was missing and some bosses didnt appear probably lost to the ages
  youre an idiot    
  
  i mentioned prototypes of the first game in particular fyi every prototype rom of x2 and x3 on the internet were dumped by me
  im glad they did sure its cheesey and over the top but it is certainly memorable
  plebbitor  maybe he emailed capcom and returned it to them for a etank mug and a copy of mm11 and ebin upboats like that fucking idiot did with the starcraft source code he returned to blizzard    but anyway yeah youre right logically i know its fairly unlikely for such an early build of x1 to be found now but i cant help myself hoping for it anyway i love this series to death and x1 was the very first game i ever played the recent x2 and x3 dumps with so much neverbeforeseen stuff have only made me even more wishful for a white city build being found      i shouldnt take an anonymous posters word as truth but assuming it is then thank you so much
i got a west coast video earthbound cartridge as a kid that had a save file with an item in ness inventory after clearing onett that i can no longer remember i think it was supposed to be frankies ultimate weapon when checked i remember posting on starmennets forums about it back when the save was intact and getting called a liar i still have the cart and it was always the biggest mystery in vidya for me sorry for the tangent
    twelve tales wouldve been more fun to play
  it certainly isnt impossible im just not particularly counting on it i do think a build or two will find their way online eventually though my bet is that they will be further along in development than the presumably very early version shown in those screenshots would be neat to at least have a build with those cutbutstillinrom jellyfish enemies properly implemented the two x2 prototypes that were found recently are the only two online public sales of x2 prototype carts that im aware of and they showed up within just a few years of each other after 20 years of nothing being dumped so anything is possible and youre welcome im glad you enjoy playing them i know it was surreal as fuck for me playing some of those builds for the first time almost like playing the games again for the first time
    i always thought it was weird that we never got to see the cetan i always though the diving pod on the level image was meant to be it
in kirby 64 waddle dee adeleine and king dedede were meant to be playable characters in the main adventure in the final game after selecting a level kirby runs out automatically and ribbon flies out with him in the dd version after you pick the level you then select one of the four characters sitting at the picnic and ribbon flies out with them  waddle dee would be able to grab hold and throw enemies many if which had unique mechanics for holding/throwing them this ability was later given to kirby minus the more direct grab which was also given to kirby at some point in development and later cut  adeleine would presumably draw an enemy into thin air which becomes real and fights the other enemies its unclear  king dedede presumably would have the hammer attacks he retained in his segments in the final version of the game  weve seen very very little of what adeleine and king dedede would really be capable of but we get the gist of what waddle dee would do as most of it was given to kirby
early 3d polygon thread
  youre the best looking guy here
  obligatory ms triangle tits
how do you feel today
how early are we talking
  this is now an actual early polygons thread
alone in the dark 1992
stunt race fx
    is this something like a gunmans proof for n64 it gives me the were copying zelda vibe
  yeah an indiana jones game total knockoff of oot it was breaddy good though

    look guys i need to show off my obscure videogame knowledge
  stop seething its so obvious op asked for early 3d polygons and some anons rightfully posted them no big problem
  arcade games are obscure  zoomer trash hard drivin is another 3d arcade game from the 80s it was pretty common
  4
i miss this era of gaming   everything was so interesting and awesome time
  i robot is obscure as fuck even for arcade enthusiasts you fail it
  fuck you you aint the boss of me
  lunchtime in highschool was this and scorched earth on the lab 486
  3
  used to love this game when it was released
  youre wrong and im right  yikes
  i used to use their recording feature to almost exclusively capture their stupid fucking faces
  whatever
  op asks for early polygon graphics  people post early polygon graphics  i dont see what the problem is also stun runner isnt obscure it was fairly popular in arcades and its been on one of the midway arcade collections
  oh is that infernal machine heard about it but never played just the whole green blank button and items on c button gave a strong oot vibe
  i fapped back in the day no shame

  why are you even here
  looks like a cheap blowupdoll tbqhfam
  played it for the first time at some amateur radio/electronics/computer shows swap meet area in the late 90s only found out years later that it was a miracle the guy even had a working cab let alone that i got to see it in the wild
  i feel like people like this are paid actors who are mad when knowledge gets shared the cia wants people in a box consuming what they want you to consume    why else act like this to an on topic post
  some years ago someone got arrested in the uk for a lara croft doll
    i like that girl and her blunt bangs
    damn this game is quite impressive reminds me of skies of arcadias artstyle and graphics
  zoomer fag detected gtfo if your first game was on a ps2 or later
  that looks awesome i love the driver cam
  looks like that comment ruffled some feathers lmao
  my all time favourite everytime i play i have a laugh especially the scene where quistis tells squall she isnt going to be a teacher anymore and squall changes stance gets me everytime also fuck ff9
  i remember when this was such a big deal i felt so bad playing it but no one would bat an eye at it nowadays
  me and my crew
  this looks awesome
  game judging from the barren environment with square buildings im guessing its n64
  max payne looked fantastic for its time great texture work especially on the faces
  carmageddon pc
early 3d  most games posted were released postmodel 3 arcade board  fucking know your history /vr/ vf3 dropped in 1996 ffs and it looks dozens of times better than anything listed in this thread hell could probably say the same for model 2 based games
the npc face textures of random soldiers in goldeneye are burned into my memory
  thats wonderful anon but what was your point again
  his point was to shame people who experienced this kind of thing on consoles/pc for some reason by pointing out accurately and pointlessly that thousands of dollars of arcade board could do pretty good 3d when the ps1 was still putting out beep boop texture warping messes
  literally open world game where you can shoot steal vehicle drive them boat cars helicopter inventory talk to npc enter building etc all of that released in 1991 on a floppy disk
  so its a bad gta running at 6 framers per second
    look at my obscure sega arcade knowledge model 3 could do ps2 level graphics am i fitting in yet
  since gta cant even do proper inventory system and engaging mission i would say that gta is more of a failed carmageddon clone
  why are you here
  why im here is none of your business lets just say im here to prevent boomer cancer from spreading to other more important boards
fuck that noise post true polygon kino
    youre not the boss of me now  youre not the boss of me now  youre not the boss of me now and youre not so big  life is unfair
  werent they faces of the developers
  good show zoomers posting playstation games itt will never know what were talking about
  obscure knowledge  are you fucking in me    a arcades existed and were relevant outside of japan in the 90s  b that shit was all over the covers and articles of mags like egm and gameplayers fuck ugp for the record  c if chats/forum logs of shit like aols ant were still around youd see people back then talking about that rad as fuck arcade hardware with crazy poly pushing power  d theres a goddamn user review of vf2 saturn on gamefaqs from 99 where the dude mentions the games fps    gamers far and wide knew about this shit back when it was all coming out people jerking off to mario 64 or toshinden 1 back in the day are in the minority
  arcades are  abcdeirrelevant and a scam  now go back to grinding your highscore on some loli pantsu shmup nobody cares about reset reset reset gotta keep resetting for score
god forbid someone posts old games on the board for old games

  what game is this looks awesome
does anyone know if there was a technical reason for fuck huge uis like in this        ive always wondered if it was poor design sense or if there was some technical limitation that prompted devs to do this
  obviously it helps performance if you dont render polygons to the whole screen think of shrinking the window size in doom youve played doom right you millennial child
  lack of loicence
  shit thats pardilla what do alejo and gomez look like
  what the hell is this
we finally have the technology to make video games look like this  video games will never look like this  im sad
  ps2 games already looked like that and thank god theyre gone because anime faces are gay

  guys are packing heat
let me know if i should pray front mission 2
  not just pray you must worship to be even considered a follower of the fromt mission 2
  on one hand the battle system is great and the worldbuilding is awesome on the other hand the battles are slow as fuck even by srpg standards turn off the 3d simulations and theres only a partial translation so you have to refer to a textfile for every cutscene to be honest playing the game in the state it is now feels itself like a battle of attrition
  i play back mission with ops mom
  the battle system is great  really i thought it was kinda boring you dont have the stupid repair backbacks like later fm games but still you just crawl through the maps and heal when you take damage and youll never lose  by the way you need to get the ultimate hits version of the game since the original didnt let you skip battle animations
  wan pray gamu
how come theres no fan retranslations for all the snk fighting games i mean it probably wouldnt even be that hard since theres hardly any dialog and its already translated the characters have way more depth than any of that capcom shit
how come theres no fan retranslations for all the snk fighting games    because obviously the people who could translate it already speak japanese and can just read the games in japanese why would they need to translate it into english
  theyre fighting games
knowing the true vision of these games
  also having played through the jap version of world heroes 2 jet then comparing it to the english version i can tell you that no the dialogue isnt already translated the english translators completely made up their own dialogue
  you know something if i were to make a fighting game i will include the game with multilinguage option for text with 3 english sub sets    english a  normal dialogue    english b  americanized/localization/working designs 4kids sabanesque dialogue cause normies like that shire    english  badly translated from japanese or even better crabsticks and typos
  theres definitely a charm to bad fighting game translations thats the good thing about understanding japanese you get to enjoy both
全時代を支配する事こそ我が目的  私は神になるのだ    my goal is to conquer every time period  i will become a god
  and the translation they just didnt give a shit
  normies like that shire  what did he mean by this
  werent some of the snk neogeo games supposedly translated by whomever on the japanese development team could kinda cobble together an english sentence
  in which op fails to understand fighting games
  which is why i would like them to be retranslated
  why not do it yourself stop relying on other people to do things for you
  yeah some people really like the characters from those games yet fan translations have always been rare
  the characters in snk fighters are very interesting i love the special intros for characters with certain relationships like terry and blue mary in kof or mai and andy so much drama with so little
why would you care about fighting games at all
  why not fighting games are top shelf in my book
  thong mucacho
  best pixel art/animation of any genre besides weeb novel shit that has no gameplay
  i remember reading that ukyo talks like a poet in japanese but he was a pretty boy in the western releases of the early games
  i mean seeing the dialogue translated has no bearing on your enjoyment of the product and you dont need to read the dialogue to actually play it most people would just glance over it
  it was one of snks main focuses a lot of their characters were beating or going really close in popularity to capcoms characters in the mid 90s in japan at least according to the gamest magazine
  retranslations  of a fucking fighting game  this is peak weeb
  has no bearing on your enjoyment of the product  not really likeable personalities or just somewhat interesting writing can improve the experience people loved to make theories about the victory lines in sf2 so theres certainly people with some interest in the type of personalities the characters have beyond body language
  well some people may look past it but personally i always read it and think its important i like that kind of stuff
i find it really distracting i finished a hard game so at least give me the actual ending
  did someone say fantran
  most of the early ones yes theyre generally accurately translated theres just grammatical errors and weird phrasings up the ass the ones people generally post in threads like these were translated by native speakers that really liked yukking up the dialogue with their own brand of humor and didnt care all that much about accuracy
      no way we can have it all 3 ways
this is capcom not snk but it would have been nice if they had retranslated the winquotes for night warriors when they rereleased it as part of darkstalkers resurrection a few years ago it was one of those games where the english dialogue was basically just completely made up from scratch good translations of the original winquotes even already exist as part of an artbook translation udon did some years ago
  people loved to make theories about the victory lines in sf2  you mean people wondering who the hell sheng long was because they somehow mangled shoryuken into that
  how come theres no fan retranslations for all the snk fighting games  because thats part of the charm
  how is it charming kyo could be the main villain in kof and we would never know
  sf2 translations are pretty garbage for the most part  in the japanese version characters have multiple victory lines but the localization only gave them a couple at best most of the time missing the point of the line  then again some are ok like how guile is more of a sad soldier in japan instead of an american badass with his line being more about his opponent having people who care about him/her back home instead of telling them to be an average joe and quit martial arts    it is part of the charm but it becomes even better when you compare the translation with the original lines
almost 20 years later and im still not quite sure what the nests saga was about
  this also people into fighters dont care about story and characters nearly enough for anyone to bother
  an evil corporation held the touraments so they could collect fight data to improve their own created super fighters k whip kyo clones etc who would then be able to defeat the real kyo and friends so they could take over the world
  instead of a romhack why dont you create a wikia with screenshots of every win quote and ending and im sure someone will translate them for you
  there are already translations of the text out there for anyone interested
  so other people should not only translate these games for you but track down the screenshots as well
  k whip kyo clones etc    ugh and thus came to be many kofs about brooding emo clones brooding about being brooding clones  fucking japan and their love for emo boys being faggots
  iori benimaru are totally gay emo as fuck bro
  no they can go look at translations already if it interests them who needs screenshots      theres not a heck of a lot of brooding the clone stuff was mostly for gameplay reasons to give an excuse to have old versions of playable kyo and a new main who is sonewhat similar as with most fighters its just a weak idea to string things together for a bit of context it doesnt really matter the most popular kofs are the dream matches that dont have any story at all
  why would they need or want to
why well bad translations had some charm and now the only people who still play snk games are dirty latinos and they will threaten to murder you if you ever touch and change something from their shitty childhoods
  look at translations you mean i suppose theyre wanting to know about the plot and characters it is mildly interesting to get the context of why the tournaments are going on and who the boss bad dudes are i just dont think its worth the bother of editing the game or even images thats me though
  no i mean these people who you think should be retranslating games for you they can already read the games in japanese why would they care about english translations
  it took me a few years to realize k is not a kyo clone i thought he was kyo who just dyed his hair and got a tan or something
  ahh you misunderstand then i dont think anyone should be doing anything for me i was just stating that it had happened most of my time spent with kofs 20002002 was playing japanese disks and i never even bothered to read the translations i just know they were kicking around out there and that there are folks that come here who interested in the lore stuff
  thats bullshit a lot of latinos are huge weeabs so i bet they would cum if they read an actual accurate translation or something
how do you fuck up a translation this badly did proofreading not exist back then
oh please op that is small time play through the entirety of wild arms 2 then you can bitch about a crap translation
they had a tight deadline to meet
  play through the entirety of wild arms 2  every battle takes a year and makes me want to kill myself ff7 moves five times as fast as this kusoge despite coming out years earlier the first wa game is actually pretty decent but the company was never able to make a good game after their initial success fuck wild arms 2
  proofreading existed then but you never
  you never what
  you were born after 1997
  english translationspanish translation  i wish the translation into spanish would have been as good as english one
still dont know to this day why people get so triggered by typos guess it takes graduating 3rd grade to be able to make simple inferences about language
  like modern games are any better in fact theyre probably worse overall
  this i prefer with the typos feels more down to earth
    if youre not just trolling localization back then even on big games like ff7 was kinda poorly resourced ff7 specifically was essentially one guy with a spreadsheet he didnt even know what was happening in each scene necessarily
  its what you get when the japanese think they can do a better job at translating the game into english than woolsey
  what is actually being said here the best i could come up with is i dont mind a clumsy man like yourself
  on second thought 不器用な can also be tactless so it could be about his personality
  adjective men like you and i arent adjective
  how much of the storys nuance and original intent of its writing is lost due to poor translation thinking of replaying this for the first time in years is it worth playing with a re translation patch
  wouldnt be the first or last time most of a final fantasy games nuance and intent was lost on a shoddy translation
  you are incorrect however wa2s translation is incredibly dire any section with liz and ard becomes a fucking pile of random words and phrases and thats not even getting into them trying to translate jokes    playing beyond the first half hour is likely to present numerous egregious errors
  at least the ff8 translation was good  artemisia  lagunamov
  artemisia is correct though  t germanon
  i was always confused about ultimecia her name makes it seem like shes the last witch or something just a confusing name
  the re translation patches make it more clear about the clones and clouds connection  plus they remove a lot of the barret mr t dialog
  good lor i didnt know about any of that  good thing there is a spanish translation hopefully that will be better
  wow good insult kid
  the new threat mod changes that line to this guy am sick
  what wrong with this it speak well
typos are whatever they exist in pretty much any game or book or anything with a significant amount of text we chuckle at them and move on no harm done    shit like  is far more insidious because it fools you into thinking its a good translation by looking like decent english and let me tell you theres way more of this in professional translations than people realize persona 5s translation is unbelievably fucked up to name just one recent example
  aeris was just a retard
  why do you think it was an insult you seem pretty insecure how are things at school little guy
  working alone with no time and no budget i just played the retranslation thats supposedly faithful and accurate blah blah blah its actually not much different and even has stupid meme accents on the dialogue    incredible series
  forgot to say he also did a translation video on one of the new xeno games also which is worth watching
  ive watched it a few times all the way through and am eagerly awaiting the final part his humor knowledge and wit are a gift
  the english version pretty much butchered squalls entire character    
  atlus usa always had horrendous translations i suspect they avoided dual audio on purpose so people wouldnt notice so much of their translations were made up
  84 once slipped up about gunvolts initial translation with gender neutral xir pronouns i kid you not and gaymergate references in mighty no 09 the same year and basically said on twitter as much that they licensed the jap audio but cut it because it would clash with the cultural differences between the two languages
  double negatives
  good thing there is a spanish translation hopefully that will be better  its translated from the english version so itll be even more fucked up  the italian version of the first wa had some serious problems like showing  instead of è because it apparently some characters werent included in the code
  ような completely left out  不器用 doesnt mean unskilled  自分も translated wrong  double negatives ignored  the translator threw that shit in google and still had no idea what was being said the entire game was like that and thats before xseed decided that they needed to change every characters personalities on purpose just look at this shit
translators get the blame but most of the times the blame is also on the publisher    they get what they pay for and they can be cheap as fuck some examples  look for translator at the last minute tell them it pretty much had to be done before they even contacted him  just one translator for the destination language  translate sheets of text no context  may omit to mention character limit  doesnt pay for testing once the programmers put that into the game    squaresoft did learn from its mistakes for instance each translation of ffix had two translators one native speaker of the destination language and one jap who knows the destination language who also actually got to play the game during and after the translation
    eops work themselves into believing its a shoddy translation because of typos its really not its one overworked guy who was given shit for resources rushing it out in a very limited time the translation itself is solid and it reads well just needed more time in the oven and a proofread play final fantasy tactics for a lesson on what a true fuckup is        the retranslation is pretty damn bad guy behind it is a walking meme among ff7 fans theres a different patch out there and fixes typos and item/materia errors id just grab that one if you cant stand them
  and thats before xseed decided that they needed to change every characters personalities on purpose just look at this shit    now i cant read japanese but i understand that was to actually give the characters something to say rather than just agreeing with the mc so i honestly have to say thats more an issue with the original i know were supposed to worship the ground the japanese walk on but maybe we need to look at this a bit more contextually too
  theres a different patch out there and fixes typos and item/materia errors  if i ever replay that game i will look for that specific translation thanks for the tip anon
  after talking with people from around the world for a couple decades and growing up with a nes ive come to overlook extremely minor errors like this if i can determine the meaning behind whatever words are there im content
  
  if they want to write their own scripts they can make their own fucking game instead of shitting up somebody elses
   doesnt mean unskilled  yes it does
  its one overworked guy who was given shit for resources rushing it out in a very limited time the translation itself is solid and it reads well  bullshit ted woolsey said in an old interview that there were about five or six people working on the ff7 translation youre thinking of xenogears which richard honeywood handled solo after most of the localization team left over fear of religious references in the games story      you cant do a phrase to phrase comparison of liberal scripts like that they often take entire paragraphs and paraphrase them to flow better in english falcom are kind of infamous for shit like starting lines with laughs copious ellipses and lines consisting of nothing but names of particular characters a lot of their text reads pretty weird when translated directly
  不器用 is not a noun in that sentence so its objectively wrong    stop defending this shit
  you sound like the kind of snobby dick who complains about vagrant storys stylized english
  i havent play vagrant story but changing the characters personality to make her a cunt is not something thats acceptable
  estelle  cunt  what
  she is in the english version so is the masked commander
  theres a different patch out there and fixes typos and item/materia errors  is there a specific name for this patch
  its a naadjective but unskilled can also be used as an adjective can it not the problem with the translation is that its a misinterpretation of the sentence unskilled by itself can be used here
    i have quite a collection of japanese and english versions of games and this kind of crap is everywhere ffvii all dqs ocarina i could go on     my daughter has been playing smb rpg and she didnt think it was funny     i go to play it and she was right    having played the english version first i thought there would be mustache jokes galore in the jpn version nopers on that smh    just goes to show that it kinda goes both ways desu    i like to think original is always better but this is one of the few times that i honestly felt the english version was better
  old enough to have a daughter  uses words like desu and baka    goddamn
  this    t professional translator
  you do know that 4chan automatically filters some words into those right
  please stop furthering this incel fantasy that 84 has any power over half that shit theyre contractors
allévoy
    um     speak japanese 13 years of study  live off and on in japan  work at japanese company    life goals cracker jack         ah crap i did not know that this site did this   i sound like a kiddiertard baka  thanks for the sage will keep my eye ot for this going forward
  did proofreading not exist back then  theres an actual answer for that gleaned from various interviews with translators from nintendo of europe and the underpaid squaresoft translator for the english ff7    you know those weird monospaced english characters in japanese media sometimes theyre called full width latin characters     the mainstream japanese encoding back then was shiftjis that had retrocompatibility with 1byte ascii english characters used by yours truly right now called half width latin for convenience from now on and 2byte japanese characters that have nip moonrunes but also include full width latin and monospaced russian and greek  japanese developers in their internal tools ignore half width latin retrocompatibility out of convenience shiftjis doesnt have european characters either since they were extensions of the ascii specification technically it does as combination characters but that was almost never used in practice a big reason why being technical restrictions    squaresoft asked their translators to   write everything in full width latin in the text not spreadsheet documents they were to give back to square  what this meant the translators copy of ms word couldnt spell check the text at all because the full width latin didnt even register as english so there was zero spellchecking woosley may have made many very very questionable translation decisions but he gets credit for managing 500k characters in 30 days with relatively few typos     for accented characters they gave the translators a list of random kanji they were to memorize for each single euro character and copy from it whenever needed the translators would then have a scratchpad list of random kanji laying somewhere in the script they copy from whenever needed and in the french ff7 that scratchpad actually made it to the final product as a visible line of random accents for some shop/inn npc  want to type señor  s e 死 o r
  the western branches of squaresoft found a solution to this problem eventually for ff8 and when they had to dump the text on their own from the games binary by discovering the magic of searchandreplace scripts to parse their normal proofreadable english text and convert it to squaresoft jps preferred format
  its just a typo are you stupid or something  that translation is terrible is a myth the script is laughable but only because the original script is so awful
  that translation is terrible is a myth  there are major plot points dropped from the translation and 101 reading comprehension errors those are irrelevant to the quality of the original plot you scat localization apologist
  there are major plot points dropped from the translation and 101 reading comprehension errors  wrong
    there are major plot points dropped from the translation    name them theres nothing more than minor references dropped watch the youtube series linked earlier in the thread if you require reeducation on this
  which other ffs had that   the most extreme localisation change i remember is yuna saying i love you whereas in japanese she says thank you
  sometimes translators tend to be unruly cunts that wont accept improvement suggestions for their weird translations
  kotaku  kill yourself
  are there any fantrans that clean up the script this shit is so cringe at times
  yes
  
  tim rogers is actually really good literally the only good thing about that shit hole seriously pull your head out and give him a go
  nice try kotaku  shithole  the only reason why it and the gawker ecosystem continues to exist and cause harm to countless people firings dcmas layoffs character assassination hitpieces heavily edited interviews breaches of secrecy shilling for corrupt practices like peddling child gambling are clicks on their articles fuck yellow journalism
  th one good thing kotakus done    his sense of humor falls flat more often than not though
  do you actually care like deep down does this actually bother you or hinder the experience
  things have to be entirely good or entirely bad a negative entity cant have even one thing that is decent
  tim does good work which stands on its own
  hi underage
  gtfo kotaku
there have been interviews or books of great developers about a crappy game that they made but what about the always crappy ones the people and companies who only made terrible games during their entire existence
  i wonder if they ever interviewed titus or phoenix games
i just realized that the opera scene and the suicide scene mirror each other
why does everybody say to skip 13 i expected as much from reddit but ive seen people on here say the same
bump
crinfe
  why does everybody say to skip 13  because they take the dubious honor of most kick assest game that ever was for a sim  it has all the usual components speed  control lots of lethal jets and a bitch load of air to air missiles if you dont jerk you head around the first time you play this game you had you hadbetter check your pulse as far as originality and the latter you will be a little miss laid and the intro will only make you say yeah that is going to be the game on the ultra 64 but other than the oe the game on the ultra 64 but other than the obvious flaws in teh tiny texture mapped terrors of the sky the game really rocks th e sound track dont suck neither wow bonus shit or what i mean what the hell do those guys at namco smoke anyway wish i had some i think those little jap bastards love to freak no i take that back i know those little jap bastards love to freak on military sims and thats cooly this game you had better check your pulse
  people dislike 1 2 and the american/pal version of 3 because it lacks the melodramatic stories
  ive only seen people say to skip the american version of 3 and play the retranslation instead
  1 is basically tuned like an arcade game trying to eat your money 2s fun but has a remake in assault horizon legacy on 3ds which also better ties the game in better to the lore of future games the localized version of 3 was butchered so is only worth playing the japanese version    thats why
 enjoyed 13   plays assault horizon   goes the fuck back to 13
  because they lack the proper means to play 2 and 3
  play 13  play the worst game in the franchise that literally no one likes  aw man why did the series go to shit after the first 3
iirc 1 only has the arcade style controls but 2 and 3 are really fucking good 3 is even better now that we have the actual story translated
  the all control the same in fact 2 is the odd one out of the 3 and plays like dog shit with ultra sensitive planes and random to hit missiles
  1 is the most skippable and contributes almost nothing to the lore fun game but soundtrack and levels are repetitive worth playing if youre really in to ac though    2 is a massive improvement soundtrack is more varied and begins to resemble the soundtracks of the later games same with the overall aesthetics mission briefings are awful and sound like theyre being given by a texan robot even if you played ahl this is fun to play especially if youve played ace combat 4 as several of its levels bear a striking resemblance to ac4 levels still skippable if you only have a passing interest in the series but slightly less so than 1    the japanese version of ac3 with the english patch/mod is amazing it has a branching story and an incredible soundtrack if you like armored cores soundtrack you will fall in love with the ac3 soundtrack absolutely worth playing and anyone who tells you otherwise a nugget
its not out of hate or malice that people say to skip 13 the first game is super short and basically a glorified arcade game so you arent missing a whole lot by skipping it the second game as a remake on the 3ds that is routinely recommended as for the third game until recently there wasnt a translation of the original japanese version the english version was butchered lacking half the game and most people dont know 日本語 nor are willing to go through the effort to import the game so most end up skipping it now that you can play a translated version on emulator relatively easily you see the game getting recommended more
op here i appreciate all of the useful info
    ace combat 2 is great
because they started playing the series at 4 and think thats the best way to play it just because thats how they did it    the actual best way to play the series is in release order it will give you a better appreciation for how the series grew and evolved over the years if you start playing the series with the ps2 games youll have a hard time getting used to the way the ps1 games play due to the more simplified slight mechanics there is no reason not to start with the first game even if you dont have a system capable of playing ps1 games ps1 ps2 ps3 psp ps vita anything but ps4 really ps1 games are easy to emulate
  the 3ds game sucks it uses the shitty joint assault physics model and isnt any fun to play
    3 is ridiculous its a genuine epic i hope they try something of its scope again if 7 is successful
  it has all the usual components speed  control lots of lethal jets and a bitch load of air to air missiles if you dont jerk you head around the first time you play this game you had you hadbetter check your pulse as far as originality and the latter you will be a little miss laid and the intro will only make you say yeah that is going to be the game on the ultra 64 but other than the oe the game on the ultra 64 but other than the obvious flaws in teh tiny texture mapped terrors of the sky the game really rocks th e sound track dont suck neither wow bonus shit or what i mean what the hell do those guys at namco smoke anyway wish i had some i think those little jap bastards love to freak no i take that back i know those little jap bastards love to freak on military sims and thats cooly this game you had better check your pulse  amazing fucking post    the games kick ass theyre just less faggoty soapopera things so /v/ prefers 45 and 0 they have better presentation/production value
  based    anyway all the ps1 and ps2 ones are
3 is the best game in the entire series 2 is good but the controls are a bit premature 1 can be skipped
  joint assault physics model  really fuck that shit ja had terrible physics and thats before you fight sulejmani
ac3 has most dreamlike music in any game ever                          
  they didnt age wellthe controls are pretty stiff and there arent any cockpit views so who cares they have pretty good music though but there wasnt anything to keep me invested in 2 since it has no story and i dont care about 3 because none of the planes are real
  riiiidge racer
  playing ac in cockpit view
  cockpit view sucks on a flat screen vr mode in 7 might be decent but it only has 3 missions and ace combat stories are generally terrible anyway
  didnt age well  i disregarded your opinion right there
  honestly 2 and 3 fascinate me ive always wondered what the original vision for the ace combat world was  ace combat 4s jp strategy guide has a map on the cover that shows the usea continent of 2/3 added on to our earth continents with some minor modification which was seemingly the original idea the ace combat 3 press kit gives the characters real world nationalities i cant remember what they were off the top of my head although i forget if that was also true of the japanese press kit or if it was part of the localisation for the west     as games theyre also great atmospherically they dont quite have the soapopera element of the ps2 games but theyve still got a dramatic feel to them controls can be dubious and ace combat 3 at times feels more enjoyable in terms of atmosphere than in terms of gameplay almost like an actual military operation with comparatively few targets to destroy and limited rewards for doing so but its still a great game that does wonderful things with the playstation hardware     a final thought/question how come ace combat 3 could do water properly while in the ps2 games its always an ugly blue texture in the mission where you have to chase the f/a117 through the ravine canyon flight/ghosts of the past the water underneath you is a clear reflective blue that looks like clean water did the ps1 have some hardware reason it was easier to do an effect like that
  it was a fake reflection it just rendered everything upsidedown beneath the surface of the water some other ps1 games did this too like jet moto
    spotted the niggas who never flew a plane in real life
  acecombat aint a simulator though
  why was the first one renamed in usa/europe anyway
  2  especially 3 are beautiful they dont seem to get brought up much when people are talking about the best ps1 graphics maybe because aerial landscapes arent the most flashy stuff but theyre goddamn exquisite     is cool stage models extracted from 3
7 is being billed as a prequel to 3 so its worth playing if you care about the series
in my imo  5  4  0  3  2  6  1  honestly 2 is a good game and possibly better than 3 given that 3 is the most divisive entry anyway and you could justify ranking it anywhere but the lack of analogue controls really hurts the original ps1 version
    assault horizon legacy also does away with 2s music in favor of something more contemporary and completely different or worse if you dont feel like typing as many words how they expected to maintain the illusion that the remake is even at least as good as the original when the latter had fire youngman and the former does not i will never understand   
  uh what ac2 has analog control support it was one of the first games to use it
  oh i have the japanese version no analog support there didnt know it was different
  wat
  ive only ever played the first one so my opinion should be taken as such    it felt like a chore to play honestly it just wasnt fun and i may be alone here but i found the set up and presentation lacking    yes its m i re of a sim as opposed to an arcade blast fest but its an early ps1 game made by namco i expected more    i may or may not be an unwashed pleb when it comes to games like this but whatever  ill play a flight sim thats actually fun in some way and air combat ace combat just isnt to me
  no but i still find it more fun to have a cockpit view otherwise it just feels like im playing with one of those r/c planes which is hawxs off mode that i hate with a passion    ace combat is all about having the thrill of being a fighter pilot without having to deal with all the bullshit a simulator brings to the table and without a cockpit view youre not getting the full experience of that are you
  the japanese version still has analog
  i went back and tested it and it wouldnt work though the manual does mention analog support i guess it doesnt recognize dualshock2 or something
  something must be wrong with your controller because it works with a ds2 i have it too and it works fine
  i agree id like to see it set somewhere between the ac3 and modern times      if you like transparent blue eye of the storm montage and linkage you will love the armored core 2 and 3 and 1 to some extent soundtracks              
  you might need to press the analog button on the controller to enable it this was back in the days when analog wasnt turned on by default
no joke the scariest game ive ever played
tell us more
  but the 5200 version is the one with glitch hell
  only played the colecovision version you scare easy faggot  rescue on fractalus was way scarier than anything else 8bit fact

i had it for genesis as a kid liked it quite a lot just tried to emulate the amiga original on winuae but it doesnt load further than first two screens of the opening cutscene are there some tricks for amiga emulation how are the other versions of this game
try the dos version 
  actually made it work had to download a different rom and a plugin in the end it doesnt seem any different than the genesis version i played except for some reason you cant have both music and sound effects at the same time
  just stick with amiga emulation because amiga version is the best version of this game when you get uae to work youll have an access to tons of other good games you need bios image and youll need to setup the machine you are emulatin correctly there are instructions to that if you just bother to google a bit its not nuclear science dont be lazy millennial and expect people to spoonfeed you just do some work and enjoy the results hajime
this one didnt make it to a us release  too ahead of its time
  there is already a thread for this game good game but no need to spam the board
  who knows doing some quick research livealive came out the same year as ffvi maybe they just didnt have the manpower or maybe the the potential profit didnt justify the translation or they just didnt think itd be a hit in the west     its not like its just livealive that wasnt released in the west by squaresoft bahamut lagoon rudras treasure the romancing saga games seiken densetsu 3 front mission they could have just wanted to focus more on their flagship titles or the titles they were most confident about like chrono trigger    if they were worried enough to release something like mystic quest they might have been worried enough to invest in anything they didnt think would succeed especially for something as experimental as livealive
i heard arin on game grumps shitting on the retron 5 and i wasnt sure what he was talking about since i owned one and had no problems with it then i tried to turn it on so i could replay yoshis island partially because they were playing it and its one of my favorite games of all time its not turning on its just blinking the front lights every 2 seconds its not a problem with the hdmi cord and everyone online is saying its retron using shit parts and being chinese garbage so i guess i hate retron now
the retron 5 is an emulation machine that in an almost unuimaginably retarded twist you still need the original cartridges for that is insane  why not just get a retropie or hacked wii or modded xbox or cheap laptop then you have all the games in the roms for free use the best emulators and so on  the fact that this monstrosity exists at all is a shitstain on humanity
  input lag
  congratulations you now think what everybody else thinks
  yep it has all the downsides of emulation while still managing to have all the downsides of original hardware
  yes emulators have input lag and real hardware is superior but if youre going to emulate anyway you might as well skip having to own the games     real hardware with real games  flashcarts/burned discs  emulation  shit  the retron 5
  i own one i dont use it a lot but i still like it being able to play the original games with the original controllers is nice without having to have all the different systems hooked up to your tv at once
  retro 5  its garbage bought one and hated it almost immediately was going to chaulk it up as a bad buy and throw it out but it turns out my wifes son really loves it ended up giving it to him which got me a sticker on the good hubby chart only 3 stickers away from being able to a buy a new game for my switch 
  hi guys sorry to see you guys are so upset at what sounds like a defective unit my wife and i have a retron v and we think its just perfect we use it for hours each day and enjoy hdmi quality visuals with virtually no input lag i even have a couple extra kept in storage for later years    right now me and my wife are replaying all the home alone games on multiple systems    i really recommend the retron v
  idk man theyre just chull guys who i listen to play video games i grew up playing yoshis island on my ds lite and its one of my favorite and most nostalgic games gg just made me want to play it a little bit again    also imagine being so much of a faggot that you think its somehow a bad thing to want to play a game because a lets play peaked your interest
  oh yeah i definitely enjoyed using it while it worked it was really great for gb/gbc/gba games i just wish there was an alternative that was more reliable once i get a laptop and mod my psp with it itll probably just be a pirates life for me
  first time i see a pr reply in 4chan fuck this 4channel shit
  first time i see a pr reply in 4chan  anon you are the problem here please kill yourself
  
  pr  not sure if this is your first day on this board or trying to troll
      how did this maymay even start
  basedboys tend to like nintendo but people often forget nintendo is also the choice for chad
  forget nintendo is also the choice for chad  whatever helps you sleep at night brah
  id put emulation on top and real hardware/games closer to the bottom i grew up on intellivision and nes and fuck paying out the ass for all the old games i used to have both systems are emulated perfectly and have features the real hardware didnt unless the flashing power light horseshit from the nes days counts as a feature also the intellivision ii controllers was literally painful to use
  maybe i have a save on a fucking cartridge nigger
  /pol/ pls
  yeah but it always seems to be the retron 5 specifically the switch thing makes more sense    theres something to be said for the nononsense experience of plopping in front of the tv with the original hardware but i dont miss swapping out cartridges and dealing the blinking light garbage flashcarts really are the best of both worlds
zoomers even let ecelebs decide what they want to play hilarious
    children who grew up playing nintendo ended up being weak jawed myopic beta males while those who played sega or playstation were significantly more likely to be alpha    mario and wii gay sex vs halo and god of war    now it doesnt mean everyone who played ps/sega wasnt a betanot by a long shot but there is some definite correlation  i grew up playing gameboy and shit and ended up on this site  friends who played ps/sega grew thick facial hair stronger jaws sooner changed interests to sports cars fucking women and had 16 inch arms 12 bodyfat going to the gym once a week  i believe they were genetically inclined to play more violent mature games versus the submissive low prenatalt betas who played pokemon mario or wii
  based and redpilled sega does what nintendont
  top row second from the right is opening a ps4
  man thats too bad have you tried cleaning your snes cart sometimes those old things just dont want to work right     as for me my wife and i bought a retron 5 a few years ago and absolutely love it to pieces it saves so much space versus having tons of old consoles and wires creating a mess all around the family room plus we can even play our growing collection of cool original retro snes cartridges on it did someone say earthbound and donkey kong country 2 woop woop it also looks beautiful in full hd on our modern flatscreen tv via hdmi no bulky old tvs or strugling to figure out how to get a good picture with confusing yellow red and white cables here man i really cant wait for more fun retro gaming nights with my wife and our trusty retron 5 this holiday season 
    yoshis island great game me and my stepson play it every other friday its great being able to bond with your kids over some classic retrogames best of all with the retron 5 you can save your progress so we can always pick up right where we left off next time if it gets too late for the little guy  
sega fans are still upset they lost
  assuming youre talking about my wife and i love our retron v and not the wifes son shit one anon made a post that sounded suspiciously like a paid shill though he swore up and down that it wasnt intentional and even posted in other threads months down the line trying to insist it wasnt and people thought it was amusing so they copied it endlessly  my wifes son is just /pol/ shit referring to cuckoldry and men whose wives sleep around and get pregnant with other mens seed
  friends who played ps/sega grew thick facial hair stronger jaws sooner changed interests to sports cars fucking women and had 16 inch arms 12 bodyfat going to the gym once a week  the console choice of chad every gen is always the one with the best sport games
im currently in love with my gameboy color but i dont have many games for it right now     what should i look into getting
arthurs absolutely fun day
rtype dx
havent played a ton of the library but heres what i can recommend  mario golf  tetris dx   metroid 2  links awakening
  this plus  game  watch gallery 2  3  harry potter  pokemon red/blue/yellow  pokemon crystal  pokemon trading card game  pokemon pinball  survival kids  wario land  donkey kong 94  mega man 35 are best
cheating a bit since theyre og gameboy games but heres my list ignoring obvious things like pokemanz      metroid 2  nemesis  gradius the interstellar assault
  my nigga
  metal gear ghost babel  dragon warrior monsters
is tetris dx better than og tetris     ive been playing a lot of tetris on the computer but i want to be able to play on my gameboy color
  i prefer the original but you can only save on the dx version
  they are both good tetrix dx feels slightly faster when you clear a line
  can you slide blocks in dx  or are they still static like og
  its just like og
i just found out there is a lufia game for gbc so try that it might be garbage though try it anyway and let me know
  pokemon pinball  this game is so close to being amazing it just needs better ball physics anyone know of a rom hack along those lines
  its got pretty awesome combat but the dungeons are randomly generated instead of the puzzle oriented dungeons from lufia 2
best handheld breakout clone youll ever find
  dont you mean what am i in for
  im not much of a rpg/dungeon crawler fan    im more into platformers puzzles and arcade games with the exception of pokemon
  looks awesome     will definitely have to check it out
    pokemon gold/silver/crystal  pokemon pinball  pokemon tcg 1 and 2 2 is japan exclusive  monster rancher battle card  monster rancher explorer  harvest moon  bionic commando elite forces  mario golf  mario tennis  mario bros deluxe  street fighter alpha  donkey kong country  game and watch gallery 2 and 3 1 and 4 are great too  mega man xtreme  wacky races  battletanx  harry potter sorcerers stone and chamber of secrets  wario land 2 and 3  conker pocket tales
  game and watch gallery 2 and 3 1 and 4 are great too  i never got into these back in the day but coming back to them as an adult holy shit these games are genius in a lot all of them you can seriously get into a state of flow that is honestly on the same level as tetris
  gbc recommendation thread  ctrlf shantae  0 results    wow unusually high number of dumb pleb fuckers in /vr/ today play shantae op
    ive never played shantae because its so expensive i might have to go through it on emulator someday
  guys kinda related but should legend of zelda be be glitching when playing in a clone system    i just tried the pause glitch with the seashells  they dont seem to be showing up on the other screen    also for some odd reason link actually freaks out and his frames get glitchd if i push the directional buttons together
  its also on the 3ds eshop
  yeah mario golf is a pretty good idea its basically an rpg and theres not much mario actually
    mario tennis is great too i much prefer the gbc versions to the n64 versions
  get an everdrive for rom hacks mario land 2 dx is really fun
  warlocked hands down  great soundtrack digital audio a small  compact warcraft 2 clone for gbc

found this console in my brothers room and i havent found anything about it ive found info about the super com 72 but this seems to be a super com 60    i have no idea about consoles but i want to learn about this one because i literally cannot find anything in the internet so i thought you guys could help me
dont know anything specifically but it looks like a cool famiclone depending on its age it may be a discrete clone and be virtually identical to a real famicom/nes in terms of compatibility/accuracy the famicomworld forums are a great resource for asking a out clones and bootlegs if you dont find what youre looking for otherwise
  it looks like a famicom clone remodeled to look like super famicom
probably just some chink knock off does the cartridge slot actually work or is just an emulator box that looks like a super famicom
  its a famiclone plain and simple
  its a nes clone with 72pin connector and probably some preloaded multicartthat plays when theres nothing in the slot
so its a simple clone great does any of you know for how much i can sell this thing
  sácale primero los veinte años de mugre y mierda que tiene así ni con un palo la tocaba
  this is the first nintendo ds built  the last one sold in the internet for 9k shekels
  what are you a junkie you found this thing in your brothers room then you come here to see how much you can sell it for ask your fucking brother he can probably tell you what it is and how much its worth but you wont do that because he probably wont want you to sell it
  i told him he used it when he was a kid and doesnt care anymore doesnt know anything about it either
  about three fiddy
  ever met a ruskie that wasnt t a junkie
  chink clones arent worth much even obscure ones modeled after the super famicom because countless were pumped into the market by chinks its a nice 20 maybe even a 4050 if it emulates the hardware more accurately to that of a real nes
  20 to 50 bucks  that shit is worth less than 10 bucks mate
  no not 4050 its piece of junk
  you will immediately cease and not continue to access the site if you are under the age of 18  i have chink clones older than you and worth more than you ops turd is worthless a few bucks at best to a wannabe collector
  super com  i like these bootleg/clone system names

what are some underrated nintendo 64 games
shiren 2
  underrated nintendo 64 games  uhhh there was not enough games on the system for their to be legitimate hidden gems please stop
mario 65
none  dezaemon 3d is good but dezaemon 2 on saturn is better  uchhannanchan is good but irritating stick on ps1 is better  bangaioh is good but bangaioh on dreamcast is better    there is literally fucking nothing underrated on n64 everything thats necessary to play is already popular
  bangaioh is good but bangaioh on dreamcast is better  if you like bangaio you will want to play the original n64 game though especially if you can play on original hardware with a real n64 controller and can play with the original control scheme the devs intended the game to be played with dpad for movement and analog stick for shooting  its also more challenging than the dc version
  nothing in fact almost all of its games are massively overrated
  oh hey look guise he posted a reaction gif he must be making a good point hurr hurr funny picture
  what are some underrated nintendo 64 games  nba hangtime
  great counterpoint tell me how many hidden gems there are on the most popular console of all time with 200 or so gamesill wait
i wouldnt really consider anything on it underrated the library is small and fairly shallow so everyone knows what the options are honestly most of it is highly overrated if anything i guess doom 64 is underrated if people just think its a port instead of an entirely new game and the pod racing game is pretty good although the dreamcast version is better
  at this point none since people have talked every game on the console to fucking death to the point where now legit shit games like quest 64 are being memed as hidden gems
  people are even trying to meme the 32x into being some underrated misunderstood system
i like ridge racer 64
  micro machines 64 turbo doshin the giant and the list could go on and on 
sin and punishment   pokémon snap
goemon  not alot of westerners know about it
  al bundy reaction gifs are good though
fighters destiny 2
hybrid heaven niggas
  the n64 had 296 games not 200 or so the n64 is a quite popular console though its not the most popular console of all timethat is not the correct way to use sarcasm you dont just say something thats untrue there has to be a point to it however the n64s popularity compared to the ps1 has increased a lot over time due to the fact that it has much better games     to be honest this is below the level of intelligence im comfortable talking to at least without a handler being present
  what are some underrated nintendo 64 games    all of them that isnt mario zelda pokémon or made by rare
  most ps1 games held up better than most n64 games /
hercules  the legendary journeys
  lmao literally every single n64 thread on every single english forum and image board mentions goemon
  your autism is disgusting kek     the n64 had 296 games not 200 or so    yeah compared to the thousands other consoles just as popular as the ps1 have 200 or so is fine considering most of those games are pure trash i wasnt being sarcastic you fucking idiot yeah for normal fags the n64 is the best console because oot a handler wtf is that do you only know about them because you have one
  i own it and im this guy  
  the most popular console of all time    is this just extremely poorly executed sarcasm or 
star soldier vanishing earth is a damn fine shmup
  lmao that game is ass and a disgrace to the series
the legend of zelda ocarina of time
    never heard of this game is this like a metroidvania
  its an rpg
    oh cool more like final fanvania
i always enjoyed space station silicon valley which doesnt get that much attention
chefs luv shack
should i play this  also whats the best n64 emulator
  i mean this
countless hours playing this
  more like blandtendo sixtysnore
this one is actually not as bad as the first i sort of liked it
  i wish i couldve played rakuga kids when i was younger great style
  i mean thats literally considered one of the best wrestling games of all time
  based and redpilled
mischief makers is one of the best platformers of the entire console generation ill fall on my sword for this fact the soundtrack is awesome
  i dont think its underrated though its super popular probably treasures 2nd most popular game
  i hang out with mostly normies so my perception of the game might be coloured but considering the middling review scores and unpopularity at the time id say its underrated
  there arent anything that is remotely good is incredibly overrated because there were so few games on that shitpile of a console to begin with
bomberman 64 jp
  can you antinintendo 64 trolls please stop you dont like the n64 we get it     thats being said ive never been a believer in this hidden gems nonsense it probably is true that most good games of the n64 have been brought up at some point
  this game is pretty good too i rarely see it mentioned
is winback considered overrated at the time most people were playing mgs myself included but i really enjoyed winback
  meant underrated
  thats not true you dont lurk enough
    a lot of n64 games were pretty rough around the edges and werent really held in high regard because of this likewise some really had a lot of polish and attention to detail and are regarded as superior on n64 especially this is often backwards    take top gear rally vs world driver championship wdc has the superior graphics high resolution mode lighting effects more tracks realistic cornering etc but its frankly just not any fun to play i dont know why but its bland as shit and i put hundreds of hours into various gran turismos so its not as if im opposed to a more complex racer    top gear rally on the other hand has terrible graphics very few tracks limited options etc by the usual objective measures its the inferior game but its far more fun to play the arcade physics are an absolute joy and the sense of speed when you nail the turns means that the game is truly thrilling to play    anyhow a lot of n64 sort of follows this pattern  games that are really period pieces and would never be made today a shitty rally racer with 56 tracks total and terrible graphics for example placed next to games which are ostensibly more modern and polished but arent actually any fun especially when modern alternatives exist    a few examples    mediocrebutfun    top gear rally  top gear rally 2  quake 64  gauntlet legends    polishedbutboring    donkey kong 64  conkers bad fur day  perfect dark  beetle adventure racing    obviously there are polished and fun games which break thi s mold such as fzero x star fox 64 etc 
if youve ignored everyone telling you to play beetle adventure racing for the past billion years now is the time to actually fucking play it
wetrix is my favorite puzzle game for the system but its better on dreamcast and pc
i know goemon has diehard fans that always bring it up but its actually rather underrated or ignored by most people who only ever mention nintendo or rare games for the system  gga is also the best sidescroller of 5th gen in my opinion
  yeah i think so those are all good games too but gga is my favorite
  depends who you ask i think winback got the reception it deserved it was pretty boring
  tetrisphere
  perfect dark  beetle adventure racing    gonna have to disagree on both of these both of these are really solid
rakuga kids
star wars episode one racer
  fzero x because people hyped that turd gx on the gamecube up so much  otherwise the n64 is the overrated box
  mischief makers  underrated  if anything its overrated simply by virtue of being one of the few n64 games that is not ass
these 4 out of my collection are the must underrated ones i can recommend i have friends who never heard of jet force gemeni either so id vote for that too mission impossible is one of my favorite n64 games
  mission impossible  one of the first times i was burned by bullshots and downgrades
  it was unfortunately rendered obsolete by no mercy the road to wrestlemania single player mode was a massive slog that got boring real quick rendered unwinnable if you did not win the royal rumble still was fun playing as terri runnels with jaqulene as my partner and holding every single wwf title and being in every match at wrestlemania
    all the cars in beetle adventure racing terminally understeer the environments are nice and cool and the visuals are obviously great but the driving itself is very dull because of this
  wrestlemania 200 had some cool shit that wasnt in no mercy so id consider it still worth playing
  aero gauge is fuckin impossible without a good stick the ai is too fast unless you boost a lot it has nice graphics tho
  quest 64 is total shit
  road rash was a fantastic series
quake 2 is underrated it has an entirely new campaign and atmospheric music like doom 64     duke nukem zero hour is also pretty underrated i think if you can get past not being able to save mid level its actually a pretty good game
battletanx was dope
  perfect dark  beetle adventure racing  jesus fuck
  also  donkey kong 64  polished
  mission impossible is one of those absolute terrible games you play because of the soundtrack
  dk64 was a triplea title released with much acclaim we all agree its shit now but it was one of the largest n64 carts with some of the best graphics etc    also noted in this thread is road rash 64 which undoubtably is not a polished game but is fun as shit
  we all agree its shit now    it was always a love/hate game with most people loving it but still a significant fraction hating it thats how it was from the very beginning and has never changed stop smoking your own turd shit you mentally disabled spastic
  there arent any underrated n64 games everyone seems to think even the worst 10fps garbage on that system is a classic
  castlevania 64 never gets enough love
  love me some tank controls
  because its fucking shit
  its better than sotn
  cv64  tank controls  you wot
duck dodgers anyone
i only included games worth playing    rpgs  paper mario    arpgs  gauntlet legends  zelda oot  zelda majoras mask  pokemon stadium  pokemon stadium 2    corridor shooters  star fox 64  sin and punishment
  monster truck madness  its a rock star co game  can go underground on some tracks  can get various powerups including missiles and flying  can drive outside the map into the water drive up mountains  lots of modes like king of the hill and hockey  ive never seen this game get any love on here but its very good if you have others to play with
  body harvest space station silicon valley and bomberman hero are still massively underrated despite the no underrated n64 games meme i frequently run into boomers who have not only never played these games but have never even heard of them       holy shit there is so much wrong with this post that i dont even know where to being im guessing this is a deliberate troll for no one could sincerely be this off
  bruh nobody digs on the imports
  duck dodgers m8
  right here
  only game i ever imported got it after seeing it mentioned on an episode of xplay  my n64 purchase was finally justified
   space station silicon valley    a game that was shortly forgotten after it was released i didnt really like it too much when i played it
    my man
  hybrid haven    kill yourself
  im guessing this is a deliberate troll for no one could sincerely be this off    i was quite serious but its not a big deal to disagree and i have to admit although i honestly hold those opinions about conker and perfect dark i knew theyd be controversial opinions when i wrote this    that said i do think many of your choices body harvest space station silicon valley etc fit the criteria i was trying to define
what does /vr/ think about the extremeg games
  that sounds pretty cool ill check that out
pic related is very underrated easily one of the most fun games ive ever played
  specifically searched for this and im glad someone pointed it out this game is probably the most zen experience i can think of for games just a shame that more people havent appreciated it since its a relatively obscure game on a platform which many undervalue and many oversimplify in terms of library
  gx  turd    i love both games no need to be salty that one gets a legitimately deserved reputation its not as if fzero x is that overlooked anyway
  cant believe nobody has said this its brilliant extremely addictive got a good diffculty slope and with 4 players probably the best experience on the 64 no slowdown nor nothin just dont play as boo or paratoopa
  i think people are turned off because its a mario sports title and think its some kind of shovelware  but yeah its a very good tennis game that game was actually mad popular in japan for some reason one of the best selling n64 titles there  also mario golf is very good
  winback is hard to recommend for the 64 when the ps2 version has that hilarious as fuck voice acting
winback was super ahead of its time there was a later ps2 port but it adds some really atrocious voice acting and the controls were clearly made with n64 controller in mind
  mario golf is actually surprisingly deep kids would be bored by it probably its also pretty difficult and extremely satisying once you get the hang of it i never played mg back in the day but i picked it up 3 years ago and was subtly impressed i wasnt blown away but its a really relaxing game to just pot a few holes the weird human characters as well all add up for a pretty intriguing game    and mario tennis 4 player is even fun to this day i sometimes get 4 players of it with my buddies from time to time difficult now because everyones got jobs and all that stuff and its still a thrill it just holds up so well and new permutations of events always seem to occur i really recommend it to op 
  this for sure
  how so it felt like a really generic third person shooter when i played at the time its kinda forgettable    also dr garcia from last alert makes a voice acting cameo in the ps2 intro so you cant fault it
  everyone goes on about the cover system
  quake 2 on n64 had 4 player split screen which is pretty much the funnest shit ever in a fps
  it feels generic because youre coming from 8th gen for the time it was mind blowing
  this guy gets it    the game is kind of above average though
  a handler wtf is that  its essentially a tard wrangler someone who stays with the retard and keeps them from walking into a busy street or eating grass
  tards are hilarious    remember when 4chan had constant tard story thread    those were the best times on this site
  that game and hydro thunder were probably the ones i played the most as a kid my favorite track was the one with the aztec temples because you could go inside them
nhl games  custom robo  densha de go  fighters destiny  gex  mickey speedway  wetrix  tetrisphere  blast corps  last legion  sbk  duke nukem  turok 3   indiana joner boner  duke zero duke edition  doomguyy  quaker oats ii  southern park  mr unicycle  1080  jikkyou pro baseball  magical tetris  bomberman arcade   shadows  hybrid heaven  is rayman 2 or re2 not good on 64 thats how i played em
  me too was fun
  i was a wrangler for about a week did 3 days with the most difficult children of all time who would routinely shit themselves and lick each others feet and i just stopped going back    worst job ive ever had
  this anyone arguing the dreamcast version is definitive hasnt played both
  the common consensus is theyre good versions but not the best due to sixth/later gen incarnations being a little more polished graphically as you can imagine
  shadows    what game are you referring to
3 mentions no picture  almost a hideo kojima game
  i learned recently that this game actually was developed by people from the msx metal gear games i thought the metal gear references were just a meme  i love hhs combat
  its fucking ugly and tries to skate by on being ohsoquirky like most treasure games   its a 10 minute newgrounds game bloated into a full release
  you wish a newground dev could pull off physics and controls like mm does
the semirealistic physics were a nice touch to this game
  semirealistic physics  in that    theres something endlessly entertaining in finding an actual physics system in an otherwise cartoony game
  fpbp  top chibi castlebuilding roguelike out there  plus the dungeons look great in 3d
    really
  not him but shiren 2 was pretty big in japan  i never played it myself but ive played other shiren games and theyre good stuff
  turok 3    my fucking nigger this is the game that never gets mentioned
  that game is so underrated it tends to get overlooked because its so different from 1 and 2 but its still a fun game
ken griffey jr mlb was surprisingly fun even if it is completely obsolete now
  holy fuck i loved that gam
  sup eleven
bomber man 64 the second attack    also mischief makers seems super underrated on this board
    this game was so unbelievably good it actually caused me to briefly care about wwf/e
  pokémon stadium  action rpg
  thats how i got into japanese wrestling from playing the japanese games
  mini games action  stadium rpg
automobili lamborghini
  seriously
    wait was this an early attempt at cqc
no love for chameleon twist
not necessarily underrated but truly awesome games  snowboard kids  space station silicon valley    these seem like shit to me but are praised  body harvest  rocket robot on wheels
  
if you like shooters star solider vanishing earth is a really solid one
  bomberman 64 the second attack is expensive as fuck though
  why not its a kind of unique game a sequel to an old western computer game made by japanese and people barely talk about it id say its mildly underrated or at least a bit unknown might not be for everyone but it might resonate well with certain people who like this type of game
  i wish mgs cqc was as fun as hybrid heavens combat
  cool
  i second this goemon/mystical ninja is one of the best series of all time
body harvest was interesting it was a scifi open world game where you drive vehicles and shoot aliens way ahead of its time
duke nukem zero hour
sin and punishment i guess although its pretty much a cult classic nowadays
        agreed mario tennis is as timeless as warlords for 4player fun
  i always loved mean machine by sugar ray and never they were the same band who made fly they were way better as a thrashy punk band
  its one of the best shooting gallery style shooters ever made imo
  i never managed to get my head around that game it just doesnt click with me not then not now
  i was scared shitless of it  i played the first one and loved it skipped the second and went straight to that fuck what a surprise
  it feels like someone dropped a bunch of shit from a toybox onto a world and then you go through the mess doing whatever mission treasure decided to make up that time
  for a licensed racer it was surprisingly good though i guess you could also say that about wave race 64 cause it was sponsored by kawasaki
does anyone know the japan only game that was 60fps
daikatana its not perfect dark but it is entertaining and fun if you turn your brain off story is entertaining tons of weapons cool environments its not perfect there are flaws ugly character models control issues but can be overlooked     quest 64 fun rpg with a unique battle system would recommend the european or japanese version for a better story conclusion a lot of populated areas are hollow feeling not enough side quests and if you load up on earth weapons you can tank through the game simplistic but charming    paperboy 64 im somewhat reaching here but its a turd i enjoy bad graphical design choice less than perfect controls but its fun if you like paperboy the added stunt mechanic is fun but wasnt fully developed
  al makes a good point though
  was it the neon genesis evangelion game
did the n64 have an unusually high concentration of racing games
  yep some great ones too  fzero x rush games world driver championship mario kart 64  star wars episode i racer diddy kong racing wave race 64 top gear games beetle adventure racing f1 world grand prix if youre feeling plebby there are also superior versions of good racers that were on playstation  destruction derby 64 wipeout 64 supercross 2000
  unusually high concentration of racing games    thats an understatement n64 had only 295 games released in america out of 388 released in all regions combined out of those over 60 were racing games in other words 1 in every 5 games released in american on the n64 were racing games what shmups were to the tg16 and saturn racing games were to the n64
  bangaio is 60fps
that rugrats dice game my little brother loved that game 15 years ago
  this game is the closest we ever got back then in games to the tone of those early to mid 90s action thrillers that you see rerun after rerun of on amc now lots of suspense lots of subdued fairly realistic action the time limit established in the story is real too and affects the ending despite there being little indication of such which adds even more suspense    the cover system is more primitive than other games that came after but unlike something like gears of war health is not regenerating and health items are sparsely placed pickups that you cant carry with you thus getting hit actually matters a lot and when getting hit the music even becomes more dramatic to emphasize just how much trouble youre in    the cover system itself is simple yet functional and still quite novel considering when the game was made the weapons are basic but almost all accounted for pretty much immediately a handgun with unlimited ammo thats basic but nonetheless lethal a submachine gun with a large magazine and longer range and a shotgun with predictable spread that can be use strategically    if this game came out on playstation instead next to metal gear solid and syphon filter i think it would have been more successful if mgs is a john carpenter movie and sf is a mission impossible movie then winback is once again one of those daily rerun low fanfare 90s action thrillers quite good and capable of holding your attention if you happen to stumble upon it
  easily worst star soldier game and retardedly easy
   i think its fun
  still pretty fun though even if it aint no solider blade
  mystical ninja staring goemon    if this doesnt get you in the mood for adventure and comedy please seek help
  i think everyone knows that game lol
i always enjoyed the wcw nwo revenge game
  spbp
  fpbp  although its not hidden in japan westplebs have 0 idea about it because of eops
    marks wouldnt know the goat wrestling game for the n64
i like scars  its kind of like an edgy mariokart its a racing game where you play as your choice of animal supercomputer car racing hybrid you pick up items and shit on the track and shoot others with it  it handles a bit funky but what doesnt on the 64  scorpion car is da best
  i had scars on my ps1 back in the day  i liked it well enough you could tell it thought it was the coolest thing ever which is kinda cute i liked the symbols they used for the tracks
  scars    lol how have i never heard of this before it looks ridiculous
virtual pro wrestling 64
  i dont think thats really obscure even if everyone or at least out of the people that like japanese wrestling plays the sequel instead
underrated ps1 game thread almost completely wellbehaved with lots of genuine suggestions  underrated n64 thread riddled with sony ponies calling the system shit  every time
  gx is a turd  can we agree to like both games damn
   ps1 game thread almost completely wellbehaved with lots of genuine suggestions  theyre just mentioning wellknown square rpgs in that thread lol
    what ps1 thread
  more like the nintendo sixtofour great games
  counting down
  i love both mario golf and mario tennis on the 64 mario golf is lowkey one of my favorite games
  there are fewer than 200 games for the system once you cut out all of the sports and racing titles
    mixed results in the games mentioned but theres lots of great games there in an n64 thread youll get the following obscure games mystical ninja starring goemon goemons great adventure beetle adventure racing bangaio and wonder project j2 people wont name animal forest or doshin the giant because theyre both better on the gamecube theres just not many obscure games on the system period
  thats still 195 more games than my parents allowed me
  why would you cut out all of the sports and racing titles
  because it goes against my narrative that the n64 only has mario and zelda
  this is the best wrestling game right here   wrestlemania 2000 ruined it
  contains a beautiful remix of the sinking old sanctuary  
  its what i do for any system really the majority of sports titles can be entirely written off and the ones worth revisiting are the exceptions
  how did wrestlemania 2000 ruin anything
  shadowman
halo wars was first console rts
  there were several console rts before that
  the first console rts was dune ii on the genesis
california speed is a fun racing game and i never see anyone talk about it has some good over the top racetracks    golfcart is the best vehicle and nobody can convince me otherwise      this and the sequel are fun unique platformers easy to beat in an afternoon but fun enough to go back to every rare once in a while
  look at this faggot
  uhhh no one ever mentioned hidden gems a game can be very wellknown but still underrated its about the general opinion of the game
  lack of polish mainly like how all the superstars were listed as superstar 1 superstar 2 etc the arenas felt lifeless and rushed compared to revenge the road to wrestlemania mode was complete horseshit that punished you whether you were ready or not and way too much countering from the ai it felt like more time was needed to complete this game and felt like a downgrade from wcw/nwo revenge in a lot of ways the caw feature was cool though alongside the new entrances with theme songs finally implemented into the game something that the wcw games didnt have
  i dont think that was even the first rts on genesis
  to answer your question i dont know but most of them are overrted because those muddy textures and razor sharp polygons mixed with awful audio and no space on the cartridge for a full game made it the worst console of its day
  and no space on the cartridge for a full game  more like no space for useless fmvs  also 5th gen in general is rather ugly if youre not using a crt
5th gen was an awkward gen but i appreciate that n64 was the last big home system to use cartridges
  sucks it didnt have a character creator
  5th gen is just ugly period early 3d has not aged well the only late 90s 3d games that still look nice are games that had heavy atmosphere like thief 1 and 2
  dude have you seen crash or mario 64 theres some beautiful games on fifth gen
  i picked up a copy of it for pretty cheap a few months ago pretty fun game only played the first few races but its definitely one of the better racers on the console
this was pretty fun played through it for my youtube channel without knowing what to expect can say for sure i wish i had it back when the n64 was still getting games so i had regular friends to play it multi
  hudson did some fun stuff on the n64
  hudson was always a pretty god tier dev studio shame they got absorbed into konami but what can you do
snowboard kids 2 was one of my favorite games growing up
  i remember the music being pretty great the shop theme from the first game is a favorite
  vagrant story and ffix still look great
  first game for me one of the very few games my sister enjoyed playing with me
  fucking this if someone could make cartridges that contain as much or more than a disc then the industry should return to cartridges as the standard
  he said underrated no garbage     op the n64 was the first console o bought with my own money and i have a lot of fond memories with it but like the poster im quoting said anything that isnt first party or rare is complete trash
dash dash dash
  speaking of goemon anybody played mononoke sugoroku looks like a board gamestyle kinda like mario party
nice to see some japanese games being mentioned japanese releases on n64 almost never get any attention aside from treasure games
ctrlf harvest  many body harvest post  0 harvest moon 64 posts  for shame /vr/
  i should really give these games a go ive heard such good things
  because who underrates harvest moon 64 like every noted good game that isnt in the top 5 most popular n64 games of all time isnt automatically an underrated classic its not a hidden gem its not a cool secret that people dont know about you cant expect to see a lot of people calling something underrated because if they did it wouldnt be underrated it would be rated highly     i dont even understand what this thread is supposed to be anyway underrated so everyone else is wrong except you considering oot gets shit on nowadays you could call it underrated
  these threads are just to post games that arent too obvious of course underrated is just a buzzword same as overrated in this case underrated just means games you like that arent the same ones that always pop up in n64 top 10 lists
  be wwf champion  have to compete in the royal rumble  that always annoyed the shit out of me    i was funny how they gave mula and mae the jackhammer as their finisher since they retained the assets from the wcw games
  why would you have to win the royal rumble to be wwf champ that doesnt make any sense
  you dont  rrwinner usually challenged the wwfchamp at rasslvania
  seconded and the sequel is good too i spent hours playing coop on global assault
  i think theyre talking about in the games story mode or whatever dude
  armorines was fun on coop never see it mentioned
the best game on the system
  one of the best jrpgs ever
  this ive spoken with one other person who knows about it outside of this board
  yeah actually a decent game i think the reason it gets mentioned so infrequently is because it was on a system with a lot of fpses and most of them were even better
  probably cause there was an arcade version i remember renting it back in the day thinking ooo decent arcade port i was disappointed when i actually played the thing to put it mildly but this was in a time before i understood the n64 shortcomings
  neither the arcade or n64 versions of california speed were that great
  fishing games are an underrated genre in general
  i think that games pretty well known
  well it originally was suppose to have you sneaking around as well that is why when you enter battles it just has a standard no advantage power meter with you often getting no power meter when youre trying to run away from enemies in a room they wanted stealth elements so you could take advantage of sneaking up behind enemies and then getting a full power meter to decimate them or get caught while running away when you are found out    obviously the stealth elements in the level design are utterly scrapped but they still kept in the advantage/disadvantage mechanics at the start of battle
  cartridges can hold more than discs and nintendo has returned to using cartridges
  whats the storage limit on a cartridge without driving prices up to unprofitable and/or unaffordable levels
  probably 64mb that was the biggest size an n64 cart had neogeo and naomi carts got up to 100mb but those were arcade machines
  what about modern cartridges
  strange no one mentioned this yet anyway shadow man
  modern cartridges  you mean sdcards
  compared to the thousands other consoles just as popular as the ps1 have  a good chunk of those being sports/racers/shovelware for toddlers  objectively there was a lot less shovelware on n64 because those game devs couldnt make those games without consuming too much time and money
  implying 4player sports and racing is a bad thing  spotted the virgin autist
  body harvest
  bomberman 64 ii
  this is legit one of the best 3d third person action games of the 5th generation
    how did it take so long for these to be mentioned one of the best series on the the system that never gets the attention it deserves
  whatever the fuck you wanna call them dude
  one of the best series on the the system    seriously
  mario sports was always associated with quality up until the latter half of the gamecube era even then toadstool tour was still one of the best golf games ive ever played
played the hell out of this gba one was pretty good too but n64 had obvious multiplayer advantage and 3d board mode
is duke 64 any good
  if you dont mind a weird control scheme and a downgraded version it aint the worst port ive seen it has multiplayer too
  better than dkr mario kart 64 imo
  its not bad but theres really no point in playing it when the pc version is so easily available
my fav    in the minority obviously
killer soundtrack
  who is the third guy on the cover i recognize nash hogan and goldberg but who the fuck is the other guy
fighters destiny 2  densha de go  pokemon puzzle league  motherfucking ogre battle 64
  thats raven you npc
  time to get movin
  raven
  as someone already said theyre using sdcards which are cheaper than what was being used in the carts of the old days problem is you now got loading screens along with the likely still higher manufacturing costs when compared to whatever disc is being used currently
    raven was such a fucking nobody it was an embarrassing mistake to put him on the cover
  youre a fucking nobody anon while raven lives in your finna head rentfree
    
  my brother and i always played that game and shit was it fun   had 1p files played before mewtwo on shard so if i wanted to practice gary and mewtwo were always loaded up blockcatching garbage block stalling double block slides simultaneous chains 2d and 3d modes and other hard techniques completely mind blowing for people watching    puzzle uni was pretty dope too would spend nights on certain puzzles with brother and friends trying to figure shit out
  he had the best mic skills in the business just because youre a zoomer that didnt recognize him or an absolute faggot that never watched ecw it doesnt make him a nobody
iggies wrecking balls is shockingly decent
  there was a shmup on n64 huh the more you know     inb4 bangai o and the space invaders reboot
  is this game a console port of a powerpoint project
  i liked it at the time except i thought i was just bad at it because i assumed you could be stealthy most of the time like in mgs
  i like that its really hard for a goemon game but all the semi mandatory side quests piss me off after awhile ive never bothered completing it because i get bored having to collect enough passes to get to the bosses    play ganbare goemon 2 on super fami instead its the same gameplay but without the shitty adventure/rpg elements it you want goemon with good adventure elements play legend of the mystical ninja or mystical ninja starring goemon
  is this the same / similar to road rash 3d on the ps1 i liked that game a lot for awhile but apparently it has a shit reputation nowadays
charlie blasts territory was always a game i can pick up where left off pretty good puzzles and whatnot
  perfect dark  fighting force  mario golf
  thats actually a pc game
  conkers bad fur day  perfect dark  boring
  not that poster but pretty sure thats not a pc game
  is fighting force that 3d beat em up
  charlie blasts territory    ive never even heard of this before
  that game had immense potential but was just kind of ok
  yeah
  is mario golf just regular golf with the mario characters
  the n64 is the one console to break sturgeons law because it has so many quality titles by percentage
  this  the 2nd best douk game ever
  pretty much yeah some of the characters arent even from the mario universe the devs are the original shining force devs which is weird as fuck or not really because they cramed a lot of rpg stuff in the gbc titles  mario golf on n64 is more arcade though and i guess its kind of a spiritual successor to the original golf on nes and game boy i never liked the nes golf much but played the shit out of the gb one  anyway mario golf on n64 is one of my favorite golf games ever only surpassed by neo turf masters
  oh shi theres a taisen puzzle dama game on n64
  anyway mario golf on n64 is one of my favorite golf games  lol play a lot of golf games why whats the appeal seriously interested and which is the best
  ganbare oh ganbare
  not that guy but try neo turf masters for the arcade/neogeo it also has a portable port for neo geo pocket color theres also a miniature golf game for nes/famicom called mini putt which is great
glover and rampage world tour
  absofuckinglutely the ps1 games are fun but zer0 h0ur is even better
i really enjoyed this at the time probably doesnt hold up well though
  i put months into that game going after gold gems and beating the sprint records  on the up side im a god at any game requiring mashing
  space station silicon valley  i remember loving the game as a kid but now all i can remember about it is the swamp of eternal stench and how ugly the guy was
  ive never even heard of this before is that related to the arcade game aerofighters/aero fighters
bomberman 64 the second attack they managed to make it quite different from 64 and its just so great it doesnt get the recognition it deserves
  yep was the only 3d one too
  pic related also sin  punishment
  huh surprised ive never heard of that before
  honestly one of the best doom games though playing it through a n64 emulator or console is pretty much obsolete these days thanks to doom 64 ex which lets you make a wad file out of the doom 64 rom and play it like native pc doom
aerogauge is fun and has a small but nice soundtrack
  neither of those are obscure at all    i cant complain though because theyre both top tier games and the more attention they get on /vr/ the better
  are the n64 bomberman games like traditional bomberman games
  they have a traditional vs mode but the games themselves are single player 3d platformeraction games  the only one thats actually 2d traditional bomberman is the japanonly bomberman 64 from 2001
  mario golf was one of the best
  hows the japanese one
  daikatana  quest 64  get better bait
  on a system with almost too many racing games to count this managed to still be notable and worth playing even if it wasnt one of the top tier n64 racers
  assuming this isnt a troll post you certainly have unique taste
  underrated games  from 5th gen era  theres really none all the gems are known this is better asked to google also this  thread should have ended here
bomberman hero was a solid game but the ost is unironically some of the best video game music of all time
      mean machine  mean machine
  haypil
  i would have sworn it did i remember making a huge black guy and calling him fat hairy rapist
  polishedbutboring  conkers bad fur day  perfect dark  beetle adventure racing  abhorrent taste
  great game multiplayer was a blast
  that game gets far more shit than it deserves  i would say it hasnt aged well but the title song was the hypest shit when i first loaded it up  
  as a sperg obsessed with tamagotchis at the time i loved pommy
  pommy    wat
  fun fucking game
  a bit more info if you are interested hogan was at that time leader of nwo white nash was leader of the nwo wolfpack goldberg was wcws biggest draw and raven led the next best stable ravens flock the flock was babyface mid card fluff but did help launch billy kidman so thats a thing
  wcw was an absolute clusterfuck ffs
is it true that virtual pro wrestling 2 was recently translated
  what are a gooigle
  all that shit happened over 20 years ago  wew
  tfw i destroyed with kim chee  absolute kino the later wwf games had more features but somehow just werent this good
  the n64 had the best 3d wrestling games ever made
  what are a gooigle    no one knows what a gooigle is
  space station silicon valley ever since a patch was made that let you actually finish the game basically it was bugged to not let you 100 it
  oh shi    i didnt know about the patch thanks for the heads up
  that games boxart made it look horrible and the content with all the sheep and shit was lame but it was an interesting game
  aint that the truith
  and now no one watches wrestling
    and the funny thing is that by far the best racing game on the system was the first wave race 64
  yeah no
  what if i dont give a fuck about tennis games in general still worth playing
  theres several youtube videos that showcase all 300 whatever n64 games in less than half an hour go watch one and make up your own damn mind
any of the sports games
  the sumo wrestling games are especially underrated
all of the treasure games
ogreina of shrek
  this it helped kill the genre of fast paced twitch reaction shooters and birth the slow monotonous cover shooters that infest fps today
  wat
  winback was not that influential dude
        what is it about the wrestling games on the n64 that made them so good compared to the ones made nowadays
  wtf
  dont be stupid its a mariovania with a major rpg stat system you could argue its has more depth than ultima 7
  underrated post time for your nap nintoddlers
  posterchild for why the fuck is this not being released in palland
    nobody cares that it was overlooked then fucking look at earthbound fags youre just trying to come up with any fucking excuse to have a hidden gem on 64 well it aint fucking happening dipshit this is why people shit on nintoddlers you fucking cant give it up not only does the 64 have to be heralded as one of the best consoles of all time but you want hidden gems on a system that had less games than sparta had spartans fighting persia
n64  underrated    everything about this piece of shit is overrated it is the definition of nostalgia goggles only people who had this as their first console can defend it this is why no one likes nintendo manchildren
  so is this the n64s street fighter
  i love the milky track    the entire soundtrack is unique its great
  you know all this game needed was cute grills characters with that art style
  you could argue its has more depth than ultima 7
doom 64    that said the n64 is shit i dont get why its put above the ps1 or even saturn so often i got duped into buying it in the late 90s expensive cartridge games lack of 3rd party ports ass controller vaseline smeared graphics with compositeonly dotcrawlfest pal version  sm64 and oot were good but didnt make up for that shit
  to add to that battery powered memory card and battery saves on some important games like oot while sony was using flash memory
  doom 64 is one of the most well regarded games on the system
    remake when
  no publisher is dumb enough to think that a cartoon bee would sell
  in the past decade weve had games about goats walking cups and mugs and a game where you drive a damn euro truck anything sells
  shadowgate 64
  what is it about the wrestling games on the n64 that made them so good compared to the ones made nowadays    
  flying dragon/hiryuu no ken  3d fighter  solo campaign with rpg mechanics  great soundtrack        
    yeah i dont care about any sport but i love some sport games like this one so much
  i dont think castlevania 64 is a bad game at all
  its not bad but its not great either its a solidly average 5/10 game
  bullshit thats selling it short its at least 7/10
      its fucking absolute trash
  its a lot of fun and has better combat than ocarina of time actually
  200 or so is fine  has four games less than 300  200 or so  how retarded are you
  flying dragon/hiryuu no ken    theres one that nobody ever talks about best 3d fighter on the system smash doesnt count
  mickeys speedway usa was made by rareware it was pretty good    tom and jerry fist of furry was a unique fighter not much content but its tom and jerry
  remind me what anime thats from
cant believe no one has said turok 2 yet  also star wars shadows of the empire  and resident evil 2
  none too small a library maybe sin and punishment
  i like sugar ray i hated them because i was getting them mixed up with fucking smash mouth for some reason
i loved legacy of darkness despite its flaws
  sp is highly rated even though its an import  bangaio is more underrated when it comes to treasure
win back had great controls just wish the levels werent as scripted like if rainbow six controlled more like win backfuck yea
  as memories of what it would have cost to have be able to play those games inera fade people will start saying well they weret that bad
  quest 64 are being memed as hidden gems    no one actually says that shit nonironically
    came in here to post this fucking plebian scum have never appreciated this masterpiece this is the n64s answer to the ps1s mgs
  this one is great    went to a party with friends and we were playing this game and it was fun as fuck to laugh at the physics sounds and music with a lot of stoned people
this right here
  great game still play it from time to time
  /vr/  nintendo 64    yikes
  many of us feel weirded out by 5th gen being retro but the limit bar had to be set somewhere  welcome to /vr/ and dont be bitchy
  road rash is an underrated series in general
  thats cause it sucked its not very well known but it certainly isnt something to race about
i got my n64 collection together lots of underrated gems
  i think you were able to edit existing wrestlers including their name but you couldnt make one of your own from scratch
  im pretty sure its the first 3rd person cover shooter ever made
  whats the first game on the left of the top row
wow    what a piece of shit system 
  aerogauge
my brother loved this game when we were little probably because it was the only game he could regularly beat me at
  thats what ive been told re4 was the second
  theyre all overrated n64 was babbys first sysyem for many many people so they have an emotional attachment that has them worship basically the entire output of the console
mrc  people seem to shit on it but i had a lot of fun when it was new and it is still fun    yoshis story  pretty short and easy but fun with nice graphics    those early games were really nice until 3dfx came out and n64 could no long do the latest games      its like half life but i think most people moved onto other consoles by the time it came out      its pretty fun      graphics look good to me they have that smooth silicon graphics look
  every console was someones first system  n64 has more good games that people want to admit its more than just mario and zelda like it or not  also  overrated  this buzzword has really lost its meaning by now
      no wrestling game outside of the fire pro wrestling series which was japanese exclusive at the time ever really had a great createawrestler mode until wwf no mercy before that youd get something limited at best or just allowing you to edit existing guys
  thanks for the reply
  castlevania 64
  sin and punishment and bangaio
  its also more challenging than the dc version  why is that good dc version is better balanced because it gets rid of the retarded shop system    also you should emulate both so you can use a controller with twin sticks seeing as it plays and is designed like a twin stick shooter
  is rayman 2 or re2 not good on 64 thats how i played em  both are better on dreamcast and pc
  dc version is better balanced because it gets rid of the retarded shop system  dc is not balanced you start at full power and theres hp refills dropping all the time its made more accessible thats not an inherently bad thing i guess but if youve already mastered the dc version playing the original feels more rewarding  also nothing retarded about the shop system its quick and fast and its based on your performance you dont really need to upgrade your shorts really the game is still balanced even if youre level 0  as for the twin sticks yeah i think the game was designed for the n64 controller in mind specifically the leftposition move with dpad shoot with analog stick
  the part where you have to grab the stuff to make a bomb and blow up the crack in the wall was kinda bullshit
  rocket robot underrated gem in its day doesnt hold up to replay now other quirky floaty platformer games have come since that achieved much more like psychonauts
the japanonly aki wrestling games
  trying to meme castlevania 64 as anything other than shit
  its an okay 3d action game anon has some high points in terms of atmosphere  definitely fits into underrated since most people who shit on it havent really played it
  its bottom of the barrel fucking garbage the gameplay is almost unplayable one of the most disappointing games of the entire 5th generation
  keep on truckin
original san francisco rush has some unique physics that are fun as hell my favorite racing game in the n64 after star wars racing    rush 2049 has some of the best graphics in the console and really fun game modes    road rash 64 is pure gold i dont know why it gets so little aprecciation    duke nuken zero hours multiplayer is almost as fun as goldeneyes
  duke nuken zero hours multiplayer    i didnt know this had multiplayer now i have to find some people to try this out with
don don donkey kong

  nobody is impressed with an apple banana
rah hah hah
  i wish nintendo would just say fuck it one day and remake dk64s multiplayer with a modern day third person shooter engine throw in someone online play and id purchase it day 1
my understanding of the whole ordeal is that this was states exclusive because of this i wonder how much did the video game market crash actually effect the industry
i wasnt around for it directly but it seems like the crash was more like a bubble bursting the success of activision convinced other companies that they too could strike it rich making games for the atati 2600 or even make their own consoles with literal blackjack and hookers 70 of all 2600 titles were produced in 19821983 and there were about 30 companies pumping them out most of whom were american companies that focused exclusively on american home systems     eventually people got sick of it all console games were just toys back then like cabbage patch dolls and to this day toys follow a similar boom and bust cycle many were made by toy companies like mattel and parker bros there was no gaming press to separate the wheat from the chaff because again theyre toys its all those smaller consolecentric developers who were killed off arcade developers were fine computer developers were fine atari and activision barely held on     i dont know if the nes saved the american gaming industry but it did save atari they were able to position the 2600 jr as an nes for families who couldnt afford an nes
  the 2600 jr saved atari
  it allowed them to survive the 7800 bombing too bad they ended up banking on the jaguar over the panther
  if they had released the 7800 in 1984 when it was already built and ready to be shipped out the door they might not have taken such a shitbath on it
  it was only a crash of the dedicated console market and was pretty exclusive to the north american region the arcade scene was still killing it and the same period saw the rise of home computer games which likely had as much to do with consoles going bust as the oversaturation of console games the nes just showed up at the right time when parents had second thoughts about sharing the computer with the kids
  had it not been for the crash atari wouldve been able to sign the proposed deal with nintendo to market the famicom in the us and the nes as we know it would not have existed
  furthermore had the deal gone through atari wouldve likely crippled marketing of the famicom in favour of their own consoles and nintendo might not have become the video game powerhouse in the west that they are today
  the nes just showed up at the right time when parents had second thoughts about sharing the computer with the kids  literally nobody had a computer in 1985 unless your dad was the ceo of a large it company
  literally nobody had a computer in 1985  oh bullshit i knew 8 kids in 85 with home computers 7 had c64s 1 had an atari 800 and i had a ti99/4a   and i would have known more but i was shitty at making friends
  people had home computers tandy were pretty cheap from radio shack
  nintendrones overestimate the crash europe and japan still had booming microcomputer and arcade industries and america still had their own microcomputer market the only things the crash affected were the arcade and console markets in america
i really hope theres another industry crash soon i really do
  the market crash came from 2 things a lack of quality in atris games  fucking stick figures running from smiley faces bouncing off of walls isnt worth money you faggots    and the cookie cutter nature of everything back then like 3 genres and everything looked the same    as a result american companies were cast into darkness and jap companbies paved the way with the next generation of consoles leaving american companies to only work on software but it was a acceptable arrangement as it allowed american companies to focus on making games atari would have varying degrees of success later with games like unreal tournament but never manage to make a successful console the jaguar was shit and nobody gave it a chance based on the controller alone there was a fucking num pad on that shit    also for companies that would show up later there was a agreement with valve to have steam be american only which gaben had verified  this was built on fears that jap games might phase them out this is a direct result of what happened with atari  valve was forced legally to open the flood gates but not all companies thought it was worth porting to pc and indie companies exploited it flooding steam with shitty side scrollers for years to come but the bright side is there is a series of naruto games that are popular on steam
  wiped out any american dev that developed for consoles excluding activision took out atari and any small arcade dev in america as well midway williams and other big names survived though along with pinball devs thats why the western industry was mostly pc game devs after that
  there is so much wrong with this post that i dont know where to begin    did you get this from wikipedia or youtubers serious question
  not him  whats wrong  begin from the start
its a burger thing japan and europe were thriving back then atari and other american videogame companies were the one that crashed pretty much  game quality was one of the factors europe had a ton of shit microcomputer games but they were at least cheap
  fucking stick figures running from smiley faces bouncing off of walls isnt worth money you faggots    i dont know i thought berzerk was a pretty fun game to play and i just played it for the first time a couple years ago
  his post is spoton the market was in a bubble like the com era and the now crypto bubble but it doesnt mean the internet was a fad or its the end of cryptocurrency its just the shovelware companies being put in the grave a literal market correction and yes games were seen like toys then why do you think every toy company lauched their own console
hes at it again /vr/ buy whatever this salesman is shilling this week    an exsierra employee has a ton of source code and masters up for auction but hasnt taken any consideration for dumping the software    what a fucking joke
buy and dump it you idiot
cam awn england
too bad mjr made a video about it it will surely bring out the approvalseeking moneybags collectors meaning the auctions will sell for way more than they would have had they just been your average lowkey development listings
  thats the point hell probably get a cut of the revenue i like the dude for the most part but sometimes he seems like a straight up shill
im more mad at al lowe to be honest  you can dump all that shit and sell it to collectors anyways sure it doesnt have the clout of nobody having the contents but collectors get off on having the physical media anyways
  to an extent at least with unreleased games the value of the physical item drops after it has been dumped
this board is for the discussion of classic or retro games retro gaming means consoles computer games arcade games including pinball and any other forms of video games on platforms launched in 1999 and earlier   go to /v/ if you want to talk about general videogame culture this isnt the place to talk about any eceleb
  most if not all of the stuff he has was released before 1999 this is about preserving that history checkmate faggot
  you dont fool me kiddo its not only that but also your average metaljesus thread only in disguise and as such it should be removed
  why would you dump something and release it for free when youre trying to auction it to make money are you fucking retarded
just watched this video something in me made me cringe watching metaljesusrock handle all of al lowes old shit     im probably just upset that i doubt i will pick up any of the cooler stuff but youve got a legend here and they see more interested in rare old shit he has than any of his experiences or stories
guys i worked for sierra did i mention i worked for sierra let me tell you about my time at sierra
  because hes trying to shift the blame he knows that hell get nuked if he releases the code but if someone else does it
just looking at als ebay page now the most someone has paid for one of his auctions was 100999 for a macintosh picasso light followed by a sealed copy of the black cauldron for 83489     some lucky chap was able to grab the disks for some of his earlier disney games for 22 though pretty cool      good luck trying to win a completeinbox item though sierra fans are old  theres likely to be many rolling in cash to splash
metal jesus rocks is an empty vessel of a human being did anyone watch his ps1 classic video he talks about how he cancelled his preorder because of the game library and then pitched what his perfect ps1 classic lineup would be like     the only problem is that he fucking shows the original copies of the games he wants on the ps1 classic as he talks about the list he owns the original games  why would he still want a classic     classic hoarder
  is al lowe also rob reiner
  a faggot is being a faggot  that makes two of you
the auction for larry 1 and 2 source code is up both are already in the thousands      i hope the german company that owns the ip doesnt end up buying this
  i find it hilarious that some of these companies like midway apparently will cling so desperately to decades old code and assets because theyre so something that they have to perpetually keep rereleasing the same shit over and over again and charging money for it they view people archiving what is so old that it should be irrelevant to their bottom line as a threat to their modern business
 current bid double yesterday up to us 660007  fuck me there are some loaded collectorfags
  an exsierra employee has a ton of source code and masters up for auction but hasnt taken any consideration for dumping the software    he doesnt have the rights to distribute the source code to more than one person
why didnt this turkey necked reject offer to test and at least make a digital copy of als files as a collector he would surely have the computers and disk drives to extract these masters    now it is up to nameless ebay buyers to do this for each game what if the disks are degraded will al give a refund makes me mad that this is on the precipice of being lost forever
im not seeing any mention on the ebay listings whether or not the disks actually work  what if theyre corrupted
buy al lowes sierra collection        what are the chances of the dark crystal gelfing adventure being released to the players
  sierra    literally who cares they werent known for amazing programming prowess
  i dont recall their games being buggy just poorly designed
god damn i just put 3 bids on al lowes first game and got rejected someone is already sitting on this auction with a big wad of cash theyre prepared to spend
     i just put in another bid to test the waters and yep  someone wants to spend more than 1k on this game     imagine how much the source code ends up going for holy shit
     it has already been dumped     
  dont be so sure people have alts that boost the sales prices of their own auctions so they get what they want regardless
inb4 activition shits all over him in court legally takes possession of the source and burns it
shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill shill
dumping  first off its his shit both in a legal sense and in a he coded it sense so clearly he can do whatever he wants with it  secondly its not superrelevant outside of interesting historical tidbits agi has been reverseengneered for nearly two decades now
  first off its his shit both in a legal sense and in a he coded it sense  except its not the source code is copyright sierra and rightfully belongs to whoever owns their rights now  this may come as a shock to you but developers employed by a company dont actually own any of the code they produce for said company or even what they produce on their own time usually under most employment contracts
  this may come as a shock to you but developers employed by a company dont actually own any of the code they produce for said company  im fairly sure sierra was too much of an amateur outfit in the days of lsl1  lsl2 to actually acquire the copyrights they paid people per game back then and didnt start hiring noncontractors until way later lowe josh mandel et al have some stories about this in interviews with matt barton
  thats the point mjr is a shill hes not someone who gives a shit about preservation
  very good chance that theyll never be tested by the buyer if theyre an mjrwatching collector
  go worship stalin and satan commie both red for a reason and that reason is the devil
  satan  red  what
  what do you mean to actually acquire the copyrights surely they would put it in as part of the job agreement sierra owns the copyright to all of the code youve produced gives a weird look
  grandpa get off the internet
  im 100 sure youre too much of an amateur to understand the basics of employment and ip law but a couple minutes on wikipedia could save you from making a fool of yourself like this in the future      sierra wouldnt need to do that in the us employers automatically own ip produced by employees the contract would have to be specially constructed to have sierra not own it
  i hate people like you stop ruining the board the topic is obviously /vr/ related
inb4 private collector buys it all brags for a month about how no one will ever see it again and completely vanishes off the map
  /vr/ related  then you should make a board called /vrr/ and take your shit there whats ruining the board is underage shitposting about their underage and claiming it belongs here because someone talked about an old game in a youtube video
sierra sucks so who cares
i won the source code for leisure suit larry 4 this game is hilarious
  most of my old floppies from the 90s have corrupted data but parts of them can be read  in postage the disks could go through an xray machine  its going to be like all those other times a collector has brought a prototype for no other reason than to lord it over other people i dont really see the big deal they are very basic games with no physics or anything its not like its donkey kong or zelda source  it would be good to hack them so that instead of typing you use menus like in the master system version
al made off like a bandit here i hope this is going to someone who will make these files public and not just some rando adventure game collector from sweden
al lowe  literally who
  heh hell probably make a decent years wage from just selling 30 year old backups i wonder how many old developers realize that theyre sitting on a small fortune of stuff just sitting in boxes around the house
  i find it hilarious that some of these companies like midway apparently  midway died years ago dipshit
  maybe but the legal ramifications probably scare most away from attempting to do so if say disney or activision owns the ip and you have the source code from some late 80s pc game are you really going to run the risk of trying to sell it or are you just going to sit on it in anonymity you have no idea how much an army of attorneys can fuck up your life not worth a quick 5 grand on ebay
  its weird why does a former employee have rights to the source code who owns sierras corpse today vivendi which is now part of activision blizzard shieeet    well its not like its anything special in itself agi has been emulated forever
meanwhile based mechner just posted his entire source code for free    
  would the person who purchased them be publicly recorded as such because if you were to buy them to dump you might face legal action from the current rights owners also is the fact that youd be severly diminishing the value of your product by doing so youre essentially just throwing money away though for a good reason
  i wonder how many scammers are going to realize that a few dead old floppies and a sharpie can are worth as much as or even more than a cdrs and a sharpie
  i dont see nwc sell any cheaper
  no one said anything about free he gives the source code as pdf away for those with no dire need of having something nostagic then the collectors could jack off on the paper evertbody wins
  never heard of the guy until now never seen him mentioned in any thread other than the big three
  selling the source isnt an ip violation is it  sharing the source publicly would probably be obviously
  underrated post
  well nwc isnt a prototype and is a title popular with regular game collectors that monster party fc prototype sold for a few grand on ebay before it was shared online once the rom made its way online the previously mentioned cart was resold and netted between 400 and 700 i cant remember the exact amount but it was definitely under 1000 it is unfortunate for those who do dump and share and want to recoup but as someone who regularly buys and dumps stuff i can say that im not as willing to go crazy on something with a rom out there if i know a prototype cart is retail typically im not even going to bother unless it is selling for very cheap
  of course it is i guess the guy is so desperate for money hes willing to take the risk which is probably pretty small especially considering the disks are probably fucked since theyre all sold untested all he has to do is run a magnet across them before shipping to make sure hes safe
  couldnt that be because once the value was known the game lost its appeal i mean if it was miyamotos hobby project maybe it would still soar but the game ia what it is not great unfinished so maybe they are not willing to part with much money for something with blemishes
how much do you think the source code for doom will go for
  
  ing  er  land
  you might be autistic
al lowlife selling important irreplaceable video game history to the highest bidder well never see any of that sourcecode once it disappears into some 600 pound monstrositys basement     oh you want the source code for leisure suit larry sorry i got nacho cheese on it
this reminds me of the people holding the source code for blood and they were asking for a million bucks fucking tards
  
  nice selfie kid who fantasizes about doing something with source code
  heineken  absolutelydisgustingjpg
whats your favorite mortal kombat game
2
i love all of them arcade versions from the pre rendered graphics era being the best of course
2
trilogy     love 1 and 2 though
  the original it looked more realistic to me and is the one i played the most because i felt like i could git gud at it the second game and onwards looked more cartoony to me and i always got my ass kicked constantly by the enemy ai felt like it was cheating
  mk trilogy on n64    3 on 3 with someone good is the most fun ive had in a fightning game the game is fast lots of characters and all of them can be good wish it had arcade graphics and sound and it would be my favorite game ever
  i always got my ass kicked constantly by the enemy ai felt like it was cheating  it did most of the time if you ever pressed the throw button youd just get instantly thrown instead
  2
  2 and 4 gold
  fun fact the ai will even do it while they are in their finisher daze
  2 is by far the pinnacle of the series  i love the straight arcade port available on the psn i assume theres one on the xbox and wii networks too   mame emulation of this title has always been ass for some reason especially the sound so its nice to play the arcade version perfectly smooth scaled nicely to hd  for retroports the 32x version is probably best
2  soul  3  soulless
  deadly alliance is underrated
  i liked it but was it really so great i think it made things overly complicated and not in a good way like it threw in a bunch of gimmicks that ultimately you could completely ignore mk4 was the start of that desu though with the weapons shit da just took it to another level and made it so mk became just about shoving in gimmicks as opposed to making the basic fighting tighter which is more important
4 and trilogy
i dumped quite a few hours into deception not retro i know otherwise 2 and 4 are the best imo
  trilogy  dem load times tho
  i mostly play the n64 version so thankfully no load times and 3v3 which is fun to play n64 version is also the one used for tournament play  i heard the pc version is the best if you can get it running
  of the classic games either mk trilogy because it had everybody or mk ii because i loved the sprites in it the most  of the entire series i really liked mk9 i know its not retro but i think it plays really well and is such a loving tribute to the series
2
  
    not on n64
  mame emulation of this title has always been ass for some reason especially the sound    you do know that none of the official releases of the arcade version bother to emulate the sound this includes all versions of midway arcade treasures the psn version and especially that shitty arcade kollection its why alot of them have issues with things like music or sfx cutting off early or music being sequenced incorrectly in the mkaks case the kollection gets a slight pass though for actually using audio recompressed from the source instead of recording from the arcade versions
anyone have any more lost games to share     
  i have undumped games but im not sharing them because they are fucking garbage
wait did some collectors stash get leaked again  good
  windows 95/98  at this point i dont want to know what games were lost to time  it seems like early windows titles werent documented properly
this is some early christmas shit  i feel like a kid again going through games i can barely comprehend
labyrinth is pretty spooky
  i love decade old ecchi
theres just something so nostalgic about these games
whatever happened to the pokemon 1997 spaceworld demo
  it was dumped check /vp/ they have threads about it once in a while theyre all crying about lgpe right now so it might be a few weeks before normal discussion returns
  rip link
  did anyone back up the link to this mega seems to be unavailable again from the looks of it
  what games bucko
  nothing hes an attention seeker
    talk about a whole lot of nothing
this isnt everything but its what i managed to get from the mega anything worth uploading
  that and dosera games too some of which you can find a shareware copy but never the full copy unfortunately      why not just make a torrent of the folder
goddamn it what happened to the link i downloaded a few and thought itd be fine if i downloaded the rest later
        
  huh a shoot em up where you rape the bosses you beat sound interesting  check the wiki  get the cat pack pc 98 emulator collection  get the disk images from the neo kobe collection  follow tutorial find cat pack pc9821as emulator is already preconfigured perfectly for this game  mount disk 1 in fdd1 mount disk 2 in fdd2  reset emulator  it just throws me into nec basic instead of going directly into the game like every tutorial says and shows  funny enough setting up a dos62/win311 vm in pcem with cdrom mouse and everything configured just the way i wanted it using old drivers and software found on a dozen different sites was actually easier i thought you just had to stick the disk into one of the preconfigured emulators reset it then play
  all this stuff is already public looks like bakudds stuff mostly
  lost  i think you need a few more quotes around that to show just how so called lost that is      no you dont people who have unreleased games dump them because if they dont and their copy goes bad its pretty much worth nothing you are fucking garbage larplet
  thanks seems to be bakudd stuff that someone posted b4 have this backed up on my hard drive myself either way if other back it then its all good
  moon was a great game really atmospheric
i literally cant unpack any rars what gives
  i remember zero divide and the ability to avoid a ring out by hanging off the edge of the ring
  heres the south park gbc game which was cancelled after being finished and was subsequently reprogrammed with different licenses  
id like to ask how this picture works out as far as i understand lcd adds a significant lag time to displays where crts do not since the laser traces almost exactly to the timing of the video signal  what is going on here that defeats that is it a digital source that gets slowed down on conversion to analog is there some kind of black magic on the lcd side  i know this is being discussed in another thread but that thread is being shat up by a sarcastic asshole and i want to understand this better
laser
    great you know the difference betweeb and electron beam and a laser got an answer to the actual question or is that all ya got
  as far as i understand lcd adds a significant lag time to displays  not necessarily
  before displaying thr frame an lcd runs the frame through a scaling algorithm that make may take very long too complete this is usually not a big problem though    lcd tvs like to insert virtual frames to reduce the blur effect caused by the holdtype displays on a crt each frame gets shown for a short moment then the screen turns black before showing the next frame you dont notice much of this at 60hz but this clears the image in your eye on an lcd the frame gets shown until the next frame is processed whithout anything in between the picture gets a bit stuck in the human eye and creates a blurring when the next frame suddenly comes up to avoid this said virtual frames are created to show something else in between frames and reduce the blurring for that to happen the computer needs to know what the next frame looks like  so the current frame gets saved in the background while the computer fetches the next frame and uses the information of the two frames in memory to create an inbetween virt frame this whole process takes much longer than simple scaling so the image gets delayed by at least one whole frame    in modern tvs the shitty virt frame creation can be turned off in the settings usually in the form of a game mode if it cant be turned off the tv sucks
  the lcd panels itself isnt that slow can start changing colour in under a millisecond and settle down a few later its the scaler chip in front of them on most monitors and practically all tvs thats the laggy part
  hi sarcastic asshole here i was bored and shitposting in the other thread but im actually quite willing to help out people who arent just being argumentative dumbfucks for no reason    so the setup in that picture is really simple its an snes outputting rgb to an ossc which sends 960p over hdmi to the lcd monitor i also soldered an rca cable to the composite video pin inside the console to output to the crt tv for comparison no magic just a fast upscaler and an old gaymur monitor
its subframe lag  lcd is on 14 turning to 15 while crt is on 15
  an snes
  indeed an snes i have not and will not ever say sness
  as far as i understand  well theres yer problem lrn2google
  how else would you say it
  i say an sness all the time trolling is a art
lcd adds a significant lag time to displays    where crts do not since the laser traces almost exactly to the timing of the video signal  nnnno a cathode ray tube only temporarily illuminates the subpixels but does it at a rate 8090hz where your eyes that work in a light bleed way cant tell    an lcd only changes the illumination transparency actually the fullscreen backlight is always on of subpixels whenever it draws a new frame or when turned off    an oled screen works similar to an lcd except each pixel is responsible for its own illumination discarding the lcd backlight this results in much better blacks    see a nerdy brit explain/show it off here 
  pretty much what i would have guessed in fact i was going to set up a similar arrangement to demonstrate using my ossc 10 year old plasma and a small pvm    so long as you feed the flat panel what it wants the delay can be essentially zero its when you try to input 15khz straight in that you find the tvs scaler/deinterlacer struggling and giving 1 frames of lag
  holy fuck youre retarded
  you know the difference betweeb and electron beam and a laser    and you dont know the difference between an n and b
  betweeb
well first of all you can clearly see the 14 on the lcd screen if means 1 out of 60 frames as it seems nearing here then thats 16 milliseconds lag while you may or may not notice this it will slow every single reaction time down for the player so if you have a reaction time of 250ms average then it will be 266ms at every single moment in the game for a game relying heavily on reflexes thats highly significant mario kart 64 time trials are sometimes within one millisecond of each other getting lagged 16ms everywhere its like imagine playing a game on lan vs playing it with 16ms latency 16ms isnt much but its noticeably different to lan or if you believe the crts have lag too meme going around they dont in the same way then its like 21ms vs 5ms for lcd vs crt    secondly this may be a fancy lcd with very low input lag it could cost several thousand dollars and outside the budget of the vast majority of people for a lcd tv     obviously crts look vastly differently to that in real life they do not have a large very bright bit in the centre of the screen noticeable at any time  those things also show up in lcd video or viewfinders yet can not be seen in real life the colours look at least as good and the contrast is known for being much better in crts
  wow youre pretty dumb
  both screens are more or less showing the same frame wtf are you talking about
  anon explained it clearly enough and you yourself say the screens arent displaying the same frame only more or less sounds like you might be retarded or underage or both
  anon and you clearly are retarded enough to considera 266ms to be significantly worse than 250ms    spoiler its not
  16ms isnt much but its noticeably different to lan  no it isnt you can live with up to 60100ms before getting noticeable delays      this its a 5 difference and less than 2 of a second is lost to a delay which a human eye/mind cant even perceive completely unnoticeable unless youre a speedrunner and even if you are one you dont rely on response time but muscle memory even a casual player will rely on muscle memory or preemptive actions if they cant make a move which needs sub 200ms reaction time if children can play fine on lcd and they are the target group and have much worse reaction times and critical thinking/planning then why wouldnt adults be able to  crt for retro gaming is the biggest meme and a scam
  reaction time of 250ms  wew lad no wonder you cant notice 16 guess you better stick to candy crush
  both of them are on 14 turning 15 dark bottom on crt is a leftover from 14
my lifes been shit lately /vr/ hook me up with a good pc game from the golden era 19972001 dont wanna spend an hour listing all the games that ive already played lets just say ive played all the major ones rpgs strategy games 3d shooters etc dont care for adventures but theres a chance i missied something good  blow my mind
stonekeep  blood  magic  might and magic 4/5 or 6  dune 2000  master of orion 2  mtgathering shandalar  civ 2  riven  delta force 1/2/landwarrior  total annihilation kingdoms  hl opposing force    dunno what else to tell you you didnt give us much
return to krondor   fairly short and linear rpg but the story isnt bad the world building is good and the magic alchemy system and lockpick/trap disarming are my favorite in any game music and voice acting are top notch and overall its comfy as fuck got me through lots of rough times     
  why dont you fix your fucking life first catface
  kingpin life of crime  blood  shadow warrior  requiem avenging angel  redneck rampage plus the expansion pack suckin grints on route 66  redneck rampage rides again  arx fatalis
  expecting anons theyll follow other peoples advice  your intent isnt necessarily malicious but im afraid he aint gonna do anything about it and rather shitpost the rest of his life
i found a cabinet of this in a local game shop last week returned today and beat it on a truly epic run destroyed all the barrels in the bonus stage and finished off bison with a dragon punch     50 cents buys a lot of joy in street fighter land discuss these marvels gents
cammy a best
  she almost killed me with that spinning backfist the first time through thawk got me and i dreamed of revenge for three days until this afternoon blanka got me once today and i had to try again other than him cammy was definitely the nearest i came to getting killed    shes still a qt tho
if you actually did beat it and arent lying thats quite impressive the cpu in ssf2 is notorious for being bullshit it does things that shouldnt be possible such as walk forward flash kick
  i honestly fucking did and i know its ridiculous im going to go back later this week and see if it was a fluke or not or if this was a miraculous oneoff    i even fucking nailed all of the barrels in the bonus stage for the first time ever my gut feeling tells me that maybe they have the difficulty all the way down or something i dont care tho there was one other guy in the store and he was watching too and when i shoryukend bison i fucking went for a highfive and it was awkward and beautiful    this was a redletter day for me
whats this game about is it just some guy and a tower
its the reason refunds exist
  roguelite with monster raising dating sim and city building elements
i played it for hours as a teen but never beat it there were better games
  youre just bad    its about becoming a man and stepping out of your missing fathers shadow    you raise monsters and challenge the dungeon to raise money and revitalize the economy of your village impressing girls and making your mama proud    by the end you can basically be the mayor and have like 7 waifus but all you have to do is make it to the final floor to see the ending    best girls are selfi and fur
  best girls are selfi and fur
  selfi   i cannot agree more
the games music was so obnoxious sounding lol
  why dont you show us an example of what you think is good
  fur  good taste selfis alright though i always did consider her the canon love interest since shes the only one in both games thats romantically involved with you my second and third favorites were cherrl and nico specifically      i enjoy the soundtrack but i can understand why people would find it annoying theres only so many times where you go through the tower that you can enjoy the same tunes over and over and the earlier floors tend to be a bit grating because of it
this was one of my first psx rpgs i remember obsessing over the waitress upgrading the village was a cool feature so was the whole dating aspect i have a japanese strategy guide around here somewhere it has a bunch of character art anyway good shit
  mia and fur
  i loved the middle eastern inspired theming music included one of my favorite games of all time
why is everyone so hideous
gamedev here  if i make a spiritual successor ie ripping off the format what things was the game missing that could be better
  if you like cherrl youre probably a predator
  because modern anime has destroyed your sense of taste
  definitely not horrible pokemon ideas that are just a mash up of two words from the dictionary to make some sort of robot/animal/magically animated doll monster
  better mons
  honestly mystery dungeon type games have been done to death already anything you could think of has been tried before
  more interactions with your waifus your game better have waifus
  sense of taste
i bought taos adventure from what ive read its worse than azure dreams any experiences with this
  but shes older than the protagonist the only two that were younger were mia and patti and i know several people online loved the former the only girl thats 18 is vivian anyways and she isnt much to write home about    tried it for a bit could not get into it at all i noticed that none of the floors seemed to be randomly generated and it was just as easy to leave as it was to appear on a higher floor on the tower even your familiar is kind of dull compared to kewne
  more interesting points of interaction in the dungeon kind of like some of the stuff that randomly appears in the dot hack games like golden axe fountains mechanical grunties random ass npcs that need help also the dungeons could use more biomes and interesting rooms than boring noodle mazes something more like the procedural generation in xcom 2 there should be lava water tiles that increase electric damage etc     the game also should have had a boss fight every 10 floors    your main character could have had more gear like helmet/armor/shield/accessory    the monsters should have had more moves and less of a focus on boring physical attacks that way theres more strategy      not really most of them are samey as fuck etrian mystery dungeon pokemon mystery dungeon and this are honestly the only interesting roguelikes ever made most are generic trash made by one guy for 5 over the course of a single weekend
  a lot of the town features seem a little halfbaked like the monster shop that never sells any monsters  you could sell your monsters to them but money isnt anywhere near a valuable resource since theyre mostly used for unlocking waifus  any tower related supposed town upgrades like the blacksmith is almost entirely worthless    speaking of waifus it also kinda suck that their plotlines end after they become your girlfriend  it would be nice if there was more scenes than just kissing you each morning
  etrian mystery dungeon  interesting  its pretty bland and broken it only gets a pass because its part of the eo series and you know it
  etrian mystery dungeon is awful
  taos adventure is fucking garbage compared to azure dreams    youre better off playing the port of azure dreams for the gbc than that shitheap
  the latter had a neat intro tune  
  the only good song in the game was furs theme who incidentally was the only good girl    
  ive been playing this on my 3ds while its vastly inferior to the ps version its still been enjoyable
  selfi is the best girl tho
  my favorite track is actually memories of heros father
      the game honestly has really good music i dont know why anyone would think its bad
  combine elements of both games   have other people wandering the tower your rival being one of them so you arent the only godly dude who can go past the first few floors maybe people that give advice provide items point out exit whatever  once the main story getting to the top is complete allow for the 99 floor basement to be a gauntlet  after reaching a certain floor selling enough eggs whatever the case the general store can sell better quality weapons/shield monster shop actually offers monsters etc    other things to think about  better waifu trees in general the original has it so once you finish a girls story shes doomed to say one or two things before repeating herself for life  the gym that can be created in the original served no purpose what if it provided a permanent buff to hp attack or defense and could only be used once per day there would be a limit of course but it allows the building to serve a better purpose  more weapons perhaps there was just swords and wands in the original but maybe other weapons can be added two handed mace/axe that allows for more damage but you take more since you dont wield a shield as an example  more focus on the town in general as it gets bigger more stuff can be sold in the general shop
  i like all those points  have other people wandering the tower your rival being one of them so you arent the only godly dude who can go past the first few floors maybe people that give advice provide items point out exit whatever  this happens in the gbc version id also like different skills you can invest into such as different magic schools and weapons skills
wow timely thread as i was playing this game on gbc last week     its a good game concept art music its just totally half baked and feels incomplete      i would honestly build up on the game itself and fill it out more rather than do a successor to it with a different storyline etc     this game should get a full remake
ive heard theres shit missing from the eng release something about the dating sim aspect being more fleshed out and involved in the jpn version is this true
  not really i think the only thing missing from the us version is the voice acting
  just pull a stardew bro its ez
chad simulator
  the interesting parts of the game were all in the town seeing it change playing minigames talking with townspeople and the dating sim  the mystery dungeon aspect was weak as all hell and could be repaced with literally anything else and itd probably be better for it
  nope all the rumors about marriage or gay romances are false  only thing that was removed was the voice acting
thanks to this thread i just sank 3 hours of my saturday into this game i regret it why do you reset to level one every time you leave the tower literally reset your stats to level 1 and start the tower over again on floor 1 whats the fucking point of making progress thanks /vr/ for nothing
  anon doesnt know
  ffucking tell me
  
  nuhuh
  your monsters level normally  also you can upgrade your sword and shield with red and blue sands so your level is much less significant than you assume
so this is happening    
the sort of person that buys these plug and play pieces of shit doesnt know what a dreamcast is
its going to be shit like most of those sega mini consoles
when you can buy a dreamcast for 50 and a spindle of 100 cdrs for 10 theyll have to price this very aggressively to get anywhere
sega japan suddenly asking people to pick their favourite dreamcast variation from the following    dreamcast mini confirmed    ok thats not a leap or anything
  no midway games most likely sad innit
  100 cdrs for 10    thats interesting because i just bought a spindle of 100 verbatims on sale for 50 leaf bux 37 us so are you full of shit or do you just buy the cheapest of everything
  clickbait article talking about something being confirmed when it wasnt even mentioned at all  doesnt bother to pastebin or archiveis the article either  stop generating clicks for clickbait writers
  i just went to walmart and grabbed the only spindle of cdrs they had                  these are all way less than what you paid
    stop burning discs and killing your lasers retards there are better methods these days
  lol riparooni your disc drive
    spotted the resellers
  this will be good because it will actually include the entire dc catalog
  i still have 200 cdrs worth of games from 20002002ish sitting in my closet most all of them work too some of those isos were downloaded on fucking dialup goddamn life was good back then
  fpbp
  dreamcastminiconfirmed  did sega just confirm the dreamcast mini  nothing about a dc mini  wew lad
  alright you fags post your must haves for the dc mini  hardmode no obvious shit like sonic crazy taxi or shenmu    toy commander  mdk2  fur fighters  18 wheeler  web browser
  headhunter  confidential mission  guilty gear x  psychic force 2012  project justice  virtua tennis  power stone 1  2  elemental gimmick gear  alienfront online  outtrigger
  based    cringe
  always nice to find another fellow hardcore dreamcast enthusiast
  id like mk gold or street fighter alpha 3 as a fighting game
  post your must haves no obvious shit   why is sony making it
  hey someone needs to be a whistleblower for that hambeast homo reviewtechusa
  neither of those are bad choices but i wouldnt say theyre must haves either neither game was particularly groundbreaking nor did they showcase the consoles strength very well    if there can only be one 2d fighter it should be guilty gear x it was the first ever high res 2d game and it took full advantage of the gdroms increased capacity due to the cdda tracks if they can fit two more then marvel vs capcom 2 and capcom vs snk 2
got a full set lads give me some recommendations
  what are your preferred genres
  bangaio
  if it doesnt have vmus fucking dropped
  anything but strategy games
  in that case go with the obvious suggestions of sonic jet set radio etc then refer to this post 
    try ecco its surprisingly fun in 3d
      hi all tim here with the usbgdrom only 110 with simple mod kit buy now
   browser  okay actually fucking laughed  the rest of your list is pretty cute though    absolutely based list i literally played alienfront online and outtrigger fucking 2 days ago
  this is like the one fucking game i have that doesnt work with my dreamcast vga cable and the game is so fucking good i actually do play it a lot so i have to fucking swap the input methods often  bangaio more like fuckau
its not a dreamcast mini they asked for titles because early this year sega of japan announced that they will bring some dreamcast classics to the nintendo switch
  tfw the switch port of shenmue i  ii will just be a dreamcast emulation rather than a port of d3ts remaster  sega and d3t fucked up by not releasing the updated versions on switch  at least i still have the pc version in glorious 4k ultra hd cinemascope
woul rather a saturn mini but that is never going to happen because there isnt a good emulator out there to steal from
  there are several
  these are all way less than what you paid  and theres a reason for that  im sure you can figure it out
  is there one that can play gungriffon yet
you know i would slightly respect these things if they were full sized and implemented with either authentic components or on fpga as it is theyre just retarded toys for children
  works perfectly using the beetle saturn core in retroarch as far as i can tell
  f355 challenge  since its segas game id hope for this    revolt  san francisco rush 2049  akklaim and midway since i think both publishers are dead i dont know what the chances are     mdk2  starlancer
dc mini seems the most pointless of the lot given you can buy a dc for like 50 bucks on ebay and a stack of cdrs at goodwill for a buck and change    that said hows dreamcast emulation on the snes classic coming along i recently updated to hakchi 35 and am very impressed by retroarch ps1 support had no idea this little thing was capable of the things it is still waiting on my usb passthrough adapter to get here though so i dont have the storage to try out any dc games
  emunigger digicuck  yikes
this was a good dreamcast game
  you seem awfully defensive about overpaying for cdrs anon its not like your dreamcast can tell the difference
  9/9/19  we did it 4channel
    pso with online  skies of arcadia  grandia 2  powerstone 1 and 2  marvel vs capcom 2  soul caliber  headhunter  sonic party   18 wheeler  ecco  outrigger  the plane game that was never released but was actually pretty good cant think of the name off the top of my head  sega rally  jsr  space channel 5  virtua tennis
  i bought pic related for 5 and they have all worked on my saturn dreamcast and ps2 their dvds worked the same for ps2 games     all burnt at max speed i think i had one or two that didnt work but were fixed by downloading a different iso
  propeller arena    and youre absolutely right its a lot of fun
could you beat a link to the past on an annual basis
no i like it but not enough to do so yearly same for pretty much every game out there except for the streets of rage series
id rather have a buffalo  take a diarrhea dump in his ear
  yes it took me a while to remember that crap like the mushroom was in the lost woods etc but i mannaged to beat it last week again
  hmmm im far too bored of it to do it again
  why not its short enough to be beaten every couple days if you know your shit and or have the time
i could but then why would i
  should you
  this instead i am going to autistically beat terranigma every other month
japanese games  no they are bad and i would prefer not to play them
  i doubt it i can barely pretend to be autistic and retarded enough to avoid being called a normie by neo/v/lets
sure its not hard at all
  i have as well as chrono trigger and gsc
  considering that ive done exactly that with other snes games like the dkc trilogy i dont see why i couldnt do that with lttp its the one zelda game i replayed the most next to zelda 2
probably but i dont really replay games anymore so its not going to happen
  ive beaten nes castlevania once a day for the last three months trying to get to the point where i can do the same for gradius but my carpal tunnel is telling me no
  no because its shit
sure i could beat it with my toes while playing an actual bigbrain game with my hands
  its a december ritual i plan on doing lttp this year too ill start after i finish the first game
i used to play oot yearly  it totally sucked the all the fun out of it itll be 20 years before its fun again
i used to do it but it got kind of boring so now i kind of do an oddeven year kind of thing i dont see how people can watch x movie every year it gets boring after three or four years
    alttp half life 2 mega man x and aladdin fuck yeah i beat these at least once a year if not more
you can beat it in a day why not
  with ff8 yeah
  in its own ear
  streets of rage 3 never gets boring
what did they mean by this
sounds like the day of the rope
    i laughed
drule
  you will immediately cease and not continue to access the site if you are under the age of 18  this board is for the discussion of classic or retro games  they meant that
zool thread zool thread
what happeens if you play track 1
this is now an aero the acrobat thread
  does that include zero the kamikaze squirrel
  honest question how the fuck do you do the dive tests
  i hate this retard and i hate western games but his japanese design is so fucking hot does anybody know who the artist is
  pedophile
     how severe do you think his autism is holy cow
  jump hit i think r to start diving hit r again to go into swoop for horizontal part hit r last time to ascend
  i played you on jag im not falling for the zool memes again fuck you and your ilk zool ant
  aero the acrobat 2 is unironically one of my favorite snes platformers come at me
  i had this on pc but never played it much  it might have been zool 2 actually
zools a solid if unoriginal platformer at least on home computers there was little like it at the time so it won a lot of praise for smooth gameplay and huge levels it was a smash hit so they made console ports with additional levels/redesigned normal ones and a sequel with more of the same but a little more personality theres better games on consoles but i dont feel they were the focus    would love to know if the arcade version happened/could be found and dumped wanted to play it badly as a kid low quality screens exist
  i played it on my dads 386 but i can remember only the first world and the gears based one  i could swear i finished it but i cant remember anything else
was zools really the amigas mascot or is that historical revisionism
  ninja ant from the nth dimension good game i had it on the commodore amiga 1200 and the amiga cd32 the cd32 version did not include the bonus levels hidden throughout the levels which let you fly his ship in a sidescrolling shooter
  one of the worst games ive ever played     entire game feels like its on ice  awful music  bland graphics  dull level design  lame attacks
  sadly we will never again see the glory days of the scotformer with such classic scotforming games as zool 2 james pond 2 robocod chuck rock ii son of chuck and mr nutz
  i scotformed your fucking mother
  zool is pretty cool
  no thanks i dont vape
im trying to run fallout 2 on my tablet i dont know much about technology but i was hoping the dex feature would make it easier to emulate
  i dont know much about technology  really  dex   ok im convinced
you always were a kidder steve
  im having a good time reading the interviews with lead people on the game    fun fact the actor who played steve went to jail for possessing cp
  i feel like more people know that know than have ever played harvester like how lovecraft is more known for his racism than his stories now gets brought up without fail  bet it was actually loli  oh hey look its miss my dad died
  i got that cutscene from showing ednas daughter a pornographic magazine 10/10 would play 100 times more
    well fuck
  i guess he really was a kidder
    hes wearing the same shirt
  like how lovecraft is more known for his racism than his stories now  i dont think this is remotely true outside of /pol/
  did not see that coming
  obligatory you always were a kiddy fiddler joke
  i agree he isnt know for his xenophobia but it has become well known to normies that he projected his fear of outsiders pretty strongly in his writing
  i didnt learn about it until id already finished the game and tried to learn something about it not sure if it adds anything to the experience or not    its a great game tho
  best written game of all time
  ahead of its time anticipating the popularity of futa
  if people want to get violent video games really banned he is the person they should really reference i would love  if i remember reading right isnt his voice dubbed over and its not really him talking
  based
    i thought the teaser looked creepier
  this game sucks and isnt even that funny outside of a couple scenes
  
  nigger i never knew what chapo trap house was so i looked it up listened to their podcast about lovecraft and its a bunch of redditors saying lovecraft was an incel and it dirties up his work because theyre a bunch of babies
cant you actually give a kid porn in this game
  roadrunner cartoons
  harvester was real and the game made him a pedophile irl along with being a fuckin serial murderer
  not exactly
  this proves what
  if you cant handle a few communists razzing lovecraft then youre a weak pussy
  why is he wearing the same fucking shirt
  damn one episode out of one podcast said mean things about lovecraft how will his legacy ever recover
  if i remember reading right isnt his voice dubbed over and its not really him talking    youre right steves lines are dubbed over by ryan wickerham the guy who played sergeant at arms creepy fuck who hangs at the lodge entrance and speaks trough telepathy
the best part about this game is watching normalfags react to it
  lovecraft was /ourguy/ through and through       seems likely that game really melted my brain as silly as it was
are there any games with a similar bizzare atmosphere
  harvester is a fever dream of a game i dont think anything really comes close to it in just plain bizarreness
  deadly premonition
  depends what your idea of batshit is its not in a remotely similar vein but something like eastern mind is way more batshit but in an abstract psychedelic way instead of some violent sort of fever dream
  i absolutely second deadly premonition that game is just sick and i mean specifically some later stage development by saying this    i havent played dark seed 2 but it looks and sounds from descriptions of those who actually played it similar could be just a loweffort mediocrity though    also d2 from dreamcast hands down that having been said d2 isnt the best kenji enos game in my opinion enemy zero is but that one is like a bizarro version of alien 1 rather    yoko taros drakengard fucking three with prequel stories and dlcs you can and probably should watch it on youtube just be sure to specifically search for the version of threes dlc with all the dialogues intact its a lets say there is a reason a majority of videos of it are incomplete contentwise    metroid other m is pretty high on the wtf factor if you make a conscious effort to treat it as seriously as possible    daikatanas episode 1 in futuristic japan when played on the highest difficulty is pure undiluted what the fuck is this shit and what did he mean by that it is so weirdly balanced and more than borderline unplayable hint turn the save gems back on  and do not install the fan 13 patch it was initially meant to be that way and quality of life improvements shave off a lot of the what the actual fuck factor    the old city leviathan fran bow winter voices cant believe i forgot about those ones    downfall the original one too but thats more of a case of intentional darkedge still the beginning in particular is very effective as some of the phrases in it are legit quotes from mental ward the author of the game was working in at the time patients then it sadly loses a fair bit of steam though but the beginning specifically is atmospheric as fuck    from what little experience i had with them capstones fps games had this weirdos basement feel to them operation body count in particular that is a legitimately shit game though
  also i cant believe i forgot about this game    lo and behold      mortalus  ortalus  rtalus  talus  alus  lus  us  s      this is legitimately the worst fucking game i have ever fucking completed bar none not even close    ill just leave it at that i seriously doubt this can be conveyed using mere words at all this shit has to be experienced in order for one to see with ones own eyes that huh even something like that exists    returning to the more ordinary games you can also try eye divine cybermancy and hl2mod called gstring    also fucking vangers but despite all the apparent lunacy that game is far too coherent and ultimately sensible to be seen as harvesters counterpart
  if that address is current he lives about 20 minutes from me  and thats pretty epic my fellow 4channelers
  haha
definitely the creepiest and most meanspirited game ive seen the entire thing reeks of rotten meat and cheap cologne
  this is legitimately the worst fucking game i have ever fucking completed bar none    i watched like 10 minutes of it on youtube and couldnt understand more than 2 words in 10 everything the narrator says just sounds like muhmastertookusthroughthehommafalamagaeteofforbodindreadandclawlikeparapets
  it has qtes by the way well more like cyberia shooting mousedriven sequences but used as qtes    failing like 80 times in a row the same qte and then 80 times the next one welcome to the fucking mortalus bitch
  it has the worst fighting minigame in the history of videogames too
  and lets not forget the fittingly godawful the worst and most nonsensical myst clone ever produced part of the game as well    no good screenshot for that one sadly
  phantasmagoria is the nearest thing ive seen although not nearly as bizarre
  11th hour probably fits too
  normies dont read lovecraft they barely read to begin with
  normies love to appear more literate and sophisticated than other normies and lovecraft is absolutely a fair game to them
i think if harvester was made today it would actually be a really good game    they had a fantastic idea with the violence going from silly and cartoony to extreme and outrageous as the game progresses
    you people dont even know any normies
  i cant be the only one who doesnt leave his house please dont let me be alone
    yeah its not the same but it looks suspiciously close pretty funny
i never got why the good ending is considered good at all    id rather be a serial killer than live in harvest holy shit
  yo what the fuck now i am playing this game and bought it for my brotherinlaw
dumb idjit pastorelli dun lined up the alarm system to the sprinklers   if you need proof hes dumb just have him wire up your alarm system   lel
there are multiple endings to this    harvester is straight up one of my favorite games of all time     theres a dude on youtube that is obsessed dwith this and has some good videos about the development    dark seed 1 and especially 2 are about the closest possible games to this 2 especially so
  is there a name for the feeling this game gives you like just sitting in its grainy 90s world suspending belief and choosing to place yourself in this world surreal is that the name for it
  is it this guy on youtube
  yep i believe so his videos about the game are really good like the one where he goes into really in depth secrets
  it was apparently intended to be surreal obviously who knows if that wasnt the developers just playing into the already surreal nature of fmv games
    link youve got me interested now
      here you go in this episode he talks about the actor of steves real life pedo charges
  that jaw
  wow thats crazy interesting the guy seems a little full of himself but definitely charismatic and entertaining thanks
more pie
harvester is my favorite game ever    what kind of person do you imagine
  dark seed 2  this will explain everything
  dont mind if i do
  sensible chuckle
  naaahh dp is weird but more in a campy sort of way harvester is something else entirely
  lol this fuckin show is great i now know more about harvester than i ever thought id know
  dps ending is very much fucked up    also the red rainy nights dont remember how they were called ingame
  plaid shirt just like in the game
  pretty fuckin funny desu
  campy  you dont know what that word means
  a serial killer
for all you people dying for harvester fan art here you go
  nice    we all know where steve is but i wonder where all the other actors are now
  this game strangely did a decent job i suppose of feeling like it was the 50s i wonder if the writers studied anything about the 50/60s era or just lived in it at the time
  thats really cool
is this worth playing or is it just memes
  its worth a watch more then anything the game itself is pretty shitty but its writting and atmosphere are unlike anything else and must be seen to be believed i dont know any other game where you can ask your mom to fuck and receive an actual answer within the first five minutes of gameplay its simply amazing
  it made more of an impression on me than any other game ive played in like five years ymmv
  one of the worst point  click i ever played
  good art but it doesnt match the harvester style at all too stylized and clean
  whos the band aid guy
  i feel like its suppose to be stylized to feel like some 50s cartoon or comic to reflect the game    steves father
  cyberia  youve awoken horrible memories id blocked out since the mid2000s fuck you
  dunno but they definitely like bad movies
  as in so bad its good    they also probably are part of an unsuccessful band that has bad but technically competent music uncommon time signatures and weird chord progressions and such
  lets be honest this game is shit
  in many ways sure but its also much more interesting than most games same deal with deadly premonition both games are rough but take advantage of videogames unique ability to create a fully realized world with an incredible atmosphere when you play either game you really feel like youre there
  i feel like its suppose to be stylized to feel like some 50s cartoon or comic to reflect the game  i just dont think it looks related in any way and the characters are only barely recognizeable the whole thing that makes the games style is the awkward uncanny valley effect of the real people on a 90s cgi background the simulated 1950slike setting is only incidental
  i will add though that in all fairness its not a game that really lends well to fanart
    haha  link to internet 
  this is what every princess maker faggot deserves
  like how lovecraft is more known for his racism than his stories now    maybe on 4chan
  like how lovecraft is more known for his racism than his stories now  only to a pile of festering maggots who speak in hashtags
  that doesnt say he was convicted just arrested
  when long ago the gods created earth  in joves fair image man was shaped at birth  the beasts for lesser parts were next designed  yet were they too remote from humankind  to fill the gap and join the rest to man  tholympian host conceivd a clever plan  a beast they wrought in semihuman figure  filled it with vice and called the thing a nigger  on the creation of niggers hp lovecraft
    all are presumed innocent until proven guilty  still post his info  wtf
  damn dude stop talking about me
    according to that he stopped responding to emails during the times of both sentencings seems like he was convicted
  i wish some one would have this much enthusiasm over darkseed
probably the most underrated game of all time  its really fun
please elaborate
  its fun  you gotta keep the zoo animals in by building bricks around them  and if you beat the second bonus stage you bang your girlfriend  whos named zelda
  also it has good sound effects and music  and it gets very difficult at later levels with a huge amount of shit you have to avoid
  fuckin a  hard as hell though
what platform is this on
  arcade  i dont think it got a home port other than the taito legends collection on ps2
  do you build with brown bricks
    only game i know of in which a glitch allows you to just over 255 lions for a 32000000 displayed bonus in one move
  i find it kinda strange that the game rolls over at 1mil but has these huge bonuses and displays up to like 99mil on the leaderboard
  taito was a great arcade manufacturer in the late 70s/early 80s this game is no exception
is this any good  i was thinking about getting one along with a mega drive/mega cd bundle
too bad you just missed the black friday sale mine arrives saturday ill let you know
one of the best gaming purchase i have ever made
dont forget to grab the matching sd card
  very good my sega cd has a dead battery so i can use the x7 to store saves instead of cutting open the system to solder in a new battery    you can also convert game gear games to run in sms mode they will be missing some colors and have a bigger display than game gear though
  cutting open the system  we both know your mommy wont let you play with sharp objects around daddys toys
  and not every conversion works shining force game gear conversion fails to play on my genesis/everdrive
  tacky
where i can read the original fantasy novel the game is based upon    did it ever got released
  unfortunately it never got released the closest thing youll find is 語られざる歴史 which is a prequel novel no translation available
      how bout this one
      it seems theres some light novels that deal with the lore of the game
    those are just namcolicensed light novels they are based on the game after all the changes rather than on gotandas original script they also arent very good while 語られざる歴史 straddles the new and old line pretty hard it could get more of a free pass due the timeline  dont take my word as gospel though a friend of mine read them and we talked about them its not firsthand knowledge
  are they fan translated    im watching the ovas and everything seems like a resume and they skip a lot of details from the game so the ovas are useless to understand the story of the game    i just love the original game
  nope my friend can read nip there are a few projects to translate them but they all died or are still very incomplete
  damn more reasons to learn gook    im just one month memorizing jap vocab so i can read scrapped princess novels
what are some examples of artists from other fields of work doing artwork for games i know akira toriyama the man behind db and doctor slump did the artwork for chrono trigger and dragon quest but id like some other examples of this
hr giger / darkseed
  what are some examples of artists from other fields of work doing artwork for games  most of them
  if youre interested i know that shotaro ishinomori made a zelda comic for nintendo power pretty significant considering that shotaro is the biggest pioneer in anime and manga aside from tezuka
  never heard of him
  technically speaking this is sort of a stretch as giger never drew for any actual game they just bought the rights to multiple pieces by giger and used them in their games
  t crunchy roll audience
shigesato itoi a copywriter lyricist and actor but known here for his work on the mother series      i like how link looks in this
yoshitaka amano worked on final fantasy 16he has credits in every ff game tho doing concept art his most known work is in 6
  damn did cyborg 009 kamen rider and zelda ishinomoris legacy is outstanding
  shad has been doing the artwork for the rainbow six series since the 90s
  you listed the name of a japanese person in a place where people speak primarily english most people arent going to know the names or creators but their works instead    googles name    i see cyborg 009 kikaider kamen rider and that zelda comicthe rest im unfamiliar with so not really that important outside of japan
satoshi urushihara took a break from doing porn to work on growlancer and der langrisser art
  beautiful concept art on the cover  game actually looks like this  this should be filed under false advertising
  you listed  no i didnt  i called you a pleb for not knowing someone major in the industry the other guy dropped the name
  if you wanna troll at least use a picture of the right game warsong is langrisser 1
hey /vr/    i have a shitty laptop and would like to play ps1/ps2 games without all the input delay i hear a lot about how easy it is to burn isos and just play those will ps1 games work the same way if i burn them and play them on a ps2 any other hardware hacks i dont know about
ps2 has a homebrew program called psx launcher but you will need to do a swap method to run burned games you could also do a ps1 modchip on the motherboard for native use

  you can get banned for that lol
so two years ago i went to a pinball and arcade game convention and i discovered my new favorite arcade game   has anyone else heard of or played space encounters before
  two hours ago i went to youtube and was told this is me now favorite arcade game  ftfy  i dont hear much about it but ive played it i remember it being a pretty bad game trying and failing to get by on gimmicks
what is your most comfy nostalgia game
  for me its spyro
  probably either age of empires or red alert 2     both remind me of a better time
  
  super mario land takes me right back to xmas 1990 every time
  settlers 1  2 then theyve shifted the way how military is handled into generic rts but it remained comfyish for next two games anyway
  ultima 7  baking bread    better with the comfy soundtrack
  there are too many of them though if i want to be really cozy maybe with a hot chocolate while outside is snowing my first choice would be point n click games so its either broken sword 1 or 2 1st is my favorite or monkey island 1 or 2 this time 2nd would be my favorite    
lords of midnight
  homm3 and for nonvr probably stalker dunno just always get that comfy feeling from both games and usually play them in miserable winter weather
master of orion 2
shining force ii  kid chameleon  sonic 2  streets of rage ii  eternal champions  syndicate  desert/jungle strike    so god damn many but all on megadrive
chrono trigger
the first mortal kombat it was shit but so much fun
  for me its simcity 2000 or the original sims 
  would probably be the original sonic the hedgehog its easy to forget how blown away most kids were when they first experienced the game it was also my first 16bit experience
super star wars trilogy
metal gear solid  fuckin fond ass memories of sneaking around snowy shadow moses in 98 under the glow of christmas lights recreate that experience ever few years    good times
for me its everquest
  love this game
  why are all frog threads a colossal waste of space
  either shivers or freddy pharkas great memories of sitting at the computer late night playing those before life got in the way
sfii of course
    donkey kong country trilogy
  this or master of magic for me probably    basically any genesis game too but syndicate i played on pc    do your part and sage it 
saga frontier 2    im considering buying an old ps to play it on a crt like it was supposed to the 4 times ive beaten it was emulated twice on a crt monitor though
for me it will always be good old chrono trigger i usually play it all the way through at least once a year
    mein negro if someone throws an snes controller my way with dkc games i stop whatever im doing and play until i beat it
    every time i play it i remember that summer i broke my shoulder when i was thirteen and spent all summer playing this game comfy as hell
super mario r p g
old beat em ups are comfy as fuck  unless you suck
heroes of might and magic 2  3    both are comfy in their own special way
  beatemups are the master race
  easily sim city for snes i love wrapping myself up in a warm blanket in the winter months and making myself a cozy little city
  i could never work out how to play it
  vectorman and sonic 1
  this game took comfy to levels i didnt know were possible
final fantasy tactics every time i hear that opening theme
  secret of mana
mario world or the snes version of sim city     something about the music in the snes sim city that no matter how old i get immediately takes me back to elementary school its comfy a little scary because of the emotions but also relaxing and soothing
ultima v being that rebel and for some reason monty mole games
  how often do you find yourself in a scenario where someone is throwing a dkc controller at you
  anything doom 1 or 2 related  links awakening or pokemon red/blue  gameboy roms in general  legend of zelda
    more often than youd think
  used to rent claymates every weekend from my local video rental mompop store    
  
  i miss those innocent days going to the video rental store with my mom  dad
  snes was my older brothers system  
  fuck off shill
urban champion        it wasnt any childhood defining game its just that i have a very fond memory of it there was some party my parents had and around 2am after the whole house stank like cigarettes and booze my cousin and i sat down and played a few rounds
  same i used to spend all of christmas day visiting family so i could never play with my new stuff until i got back home but that brand new game boy came right along with me
resident evil 13 though nostalgia wore off long ago since i replay them once or twice a year  i have a soft spot for ps1 bond games the original gran turismo and tomb raider 2
  this so much came here to write the exact same sentence everything from the music to the cozy animations and the relaxing gameplay    also  monkey island  super mario land  super mario world
  streets of rage 2
  goonies 2  first game i ever beat as a kid
  based unironically better than pokémon however i have to disagree  you want to see your monster win the battles the errantry and just watch him being happy even though things will not often go as you planned   for a reason or another he will run away from home and youll be desperate to have him back asap because he ended to be like the son you never got  in the end he dies of old age and so you have to repeat the cycle with another monster knowing damn well the same thing will happen sooner or later leaving you in utter despair  fucking e rating  
mega man 2  tecmo super bowl   final fantasy iv  and super mario world
for me its pokemon red but i think many retro games are very comfy
  i want to get into this should i just play read the manual or what
    cant marry colt
  this i literally worshipped these games as a child max comfy for me other than that super mario world or pokemon crystal
  just play the gameplay is quite intuitive and not overly complicated thats what makes it so addictive
    when your monster bro dies
  the other week i switched meds and my anxiety started acting up i started replaying pic related and it made me feel a lot better im not sure why something about the prerendered backgrounds the warm midi music and the lowpoly models just exudes comfiness takes me back to my adolescence    
lords of the realm ii    your people are starving my lord  max comfy
  switched meds from what to what
build engine thread for the general discussion of the classic firstperson shooters duke nukem 3d shadow warrior blood and others
douk  blood  shadow warrior  redneck rampage
slavedriver  build
i finally played redneck rampage recently and completed the first episode the game design is varying degrees of pointlessly open and bloated somewhat decent and kind of modish the first level especially is very large and weird to the point that its almost a proto openworld fps but its not so great in how its presented another noticeable thing i realized about the game is that a lot of the build effects are not nearly as used enough especially sloped surfaces being very absent was very identifiable because of how big the levels are you can see how flat everything really is whereas in duke nukem there are crafted details shading and slopes everywhere but its much much rarer in rr in fact the first object you see in duke nukem is the vent thing on the roof which is basically a big double slope already differentiating it from doom duke also way more assets and scripted stuff in general its much more masterful and alive im not going to bother talking about the weapons enemies art style etc probably most people agree that it isnt nearly as good as the other games    tldr playing redneck rampage made me appreciate slopes
  half of the levels in rr and a bit less than half in ra are boring with flat layout and go from house to house progression    the other half have great layouts great themes and are often full of build porn and awesome tricks    for some reasons the game starts with a boring one and even the demo was based on that    if you want slopes check out the mine level
  i only played episode 1 so far there are some instances of goodness like level 2 but a lot of it is too weird or amateur and frankly i cannot stand the last 2 levels of episode 1 even though they look competently mapped out
anyone remember kens labyrinth      do you think gaming could ever be this weird again     
  no powerslave
so the other day i decided to replay death wish since it has had an update    i ended up playing 3 times in a row well done pitchfork start    its so fucking good     whats your favourite dw level so many great ones i cant make up my mind and id probably list 10 although shadehaven would be one of those 10   the best looking levels are those that make great use of the different palettes and shadehaven has great layout and progression on top of it that  its theme make it like a stock map
derelict is still awesome bitches
build thread  few anons rank the games  short optional discussion about some vanilla duke maps  thread falls to the bottom  one or two rescue attempts  thread dies
  it is but wavemistress is better
bloodduki nukishadow warrior rampage  rrs level design is boring as fuck
  what is it about this game/engine that makes every screenshot look like a 2d hand drawn background
  best mod ever made for any game
  nice gamma faggot cant see shit
  wavemistress is pretty good but it sticks with the more leisurely and cheerful tone of duke caribbean which is great i love the tone and style of this expansion but derelict feels more like a proper dark dungeon run only instead of being a brick dungeon with skeletons and demons its a rusty metal dungeon out in the ocean populated with mutants and aliens    i like both a lot but for some quite different reasons
    why does this guy suck so much at blood   he wasnt so bad at shadow warrior i wanna facepalm at pretty much everything he says and does in blood  is this how people play blood they find an okay way to play and dont try to do better
  dunno i thought the level with tornadoes was great fun if only because of its concept iirc there is a secret only reachable through riding on the tornado there too also wasnt the last level of ep1 the smelting plant i thought that was pretty decent as well    anyway next up for you if i am not mistaken is downtown hickston and it is legit one of my favorite build levels ever youll see why
  also another two highlights in the game for me were the ruins and the mortuary both also in ep2 although further along not immediately after downtown hickston that is
  i think there is a clearly observable dare i say objective fact that in my personal opinion has at least some degree of relation to dukes and bloods respective gamedesign    duke has a shitton of userlevels for it especially if you count in the prehistoric pre2000 period    blood doesnt    make of it what you will
  except shadow warrior has even less so i dont think thats it    i think its just that blood plays differently and has a much higher skill ceiling than sw/duke and even if its first time playing on well done and it sounds like it is then yeah he wont be very pro at it
i dont get the blood is hard meme ive had way more issues with damn im good on dn3d rather than extra crispy on blood and ive played a lot of both this because there are way more methods with the latter that will make you avoid dying crouching taking cover jumping using well your op weapons and so on all these things make a huge difference when compared to your average gameplay methods on dn3d thats at least my opinion im not saying that blood isnt challenging but i think that once you grasp the basic stuff and work from there itll be a breeze way more than other build games
  what are top10 rr and ra maps
  rr top5  smeltin plants  uranium mines  lumberland  junkyard  jcucks    r66 top3  brewery  slaughter house  hoover dam    ra top4  refinery  moto madness  brothel  gamblin boat  disgrace land    all best rr maps
  thanks do you know the actual author
    gerox kruo
what genuine innovations did blood introduce into the fps genre when i really think about it i cant name a single one maybe i am forgetting something or looking the wrong way
  cant really think of anything its kind of like duke nukem 3d except its gothic horror themed a simplification for sure but it doesnt have any advanced or revolutionary feature to it that duke nukem 3d didnt have    fucking fun though
  oh wait now i remember near every weapon had an alternate fire of some kind which was an extremely new and unusual thing at the time
  crouching makes a real difference in gunplay enemies have a harder time to hit you and crouching enemies are also harder to hit   crouching was still novel at the time and other fps which had it the most purpose youd get of it would be to crawl into narrow spaces
whats your favorite retro 3d/polygonal fighter
    well you posted my favorite ps1 one right there after that i always had a special fondness for the saturn port of doa1 and still think its one of the better games in the series
  bloody roar 2
tekken 2 i really like the backgrounds and music very relaxing to play or boot up near christmas   oh and the games fun too i guess
  for me its virtua fighter 2
  thats the only 3d fighter i ever played much of so it i guess
  a lot of yotubers are crapping on this game right now due to the ps1 classic coming out soon fuck them all it was awesome a lot more fun than the first tekken game felt like a more streetfightery soul blade
  it was shit and overrated because it was the first 3d fighter to come to psx and for its graphics
tekken 3 i suppose
 rival schools    but i have fond memories of battle arena toshinden and psychic force
  it was shit and overrated    it emphasized 3d movement a lot more than even soul blade which made it a lot of fun also had great music and good arrangement of different characters with unique abilities and play styles how is that a bad
  massive input lag
  bushido blade
  what is voldos deal
  blind and deaf guardian of his masters treasure horde
last bronx
rares renders were ahead of their time
even if tekken 3 is better in every way that matters i will always have a soft spot for tekken 2
  nintentard making the thread about himself since he bought the nogames64
  pic related i grew up loving this game even if voldos 2p costume literally scared the hell out of me as a little boy  older brother used to tease the hell out of me for it because id ask him not to pick it and he loved to mess with me  i still play it from time to time it holds up really well like tekken 3 does
  battle  arena  toshinden  on pc    this is my real answer probably    absolutely fantastic answer    nogames64  kek    is soul calibur 1 or doa2 retro enough its /vr/ cuz dreamcast but i can see how theyre too new if they dont count it is fighters megamix for saturn or if thats too much of a meme compilation for you then vf2
tobal
  you just posted it fucking awesome game
  bat aged so badly its such a bad fighting game
  my mate and i were so hyped for this game turns out you can complete the single player in 5 minutes there are no unlocks nothing was pretty disappointing not many characters/weapons multiplayer was fun but very repetitive
fighting vipers its virtua fighter on drugs stuck in a 90s timebox also pic related is one of the reasons why
  why not tobal 2
  it hasnt aged badly it was absolute fucking shit when it was released and is still shit now    was nobody here who praises it of age when it came out because i remember it being crapped on by every respectable publication of the time    tekken 1 destroyed it but hey ellis had a transparent skirt
  a game mag from my country rated bat 95/100 while tekken received a 92
  the editor of that magazine needed their head examined
were there any major difference in terms of gameplay between virtua fighter 1/2 doa 1 and early tekken besides different characters and the parry button in doa
  /v/ in 1997  n64 has no games
  most game reviewers have always been shit specially during the ps1/n64 days a lot of them would praise games just for being in 3d even if they were clearly lacking in the fundamental aspects of their gameplay and the like
  yeah very enjoyable to play even if the sequel improved the formula by such a large margin
tekken 3 soul calibur plasma sword doa and mace the dark age are the only 90s 3d fighters i can play
  ive never played doa but the biggest difference between tekken and virtua fighter is the size of the ring vf also isnt nearly as juggleheavy as tekken virtua fighters stance system also meant characters had a lot more moves than tekken
i played the hell out of tekken 3 back in the day i have had less than zero interest in the series since i have no clue why t3 sang a siren call to me
  it just felt massive for its era a gazillion of game modes endless roster 2 soundtracks kinda accesible everyone had it so you could play vs everyone even if you had a friend who didnt like fighters you could still play volleyball with him
toshinden 3  its so broken unbalanced and it had mj  were not really that competitive minded so whenever me and my friends gather we had tons of fun playing this      that and sfexa
sonic cd
snatcher
off the top of my head and in no particular order    road rash  batman returns  star blade  eternal champions  final fight  soul star  the terminator  robot aleste  silpheed  afterburner iii  mickey mania  sonic cd  snatcher  keiko flying squadron  earthworm jim
  dont forget about mortal kombat and the lunar games
  im not partial to either but guess others would be so should be included
heart of the alien
  my copy of snatcher is working  during the opening cutscene when the credits come up and say metal gear the game loops the same 5 frames and the music loops  i can skip the op at that moment but it fucking sucks that this is happening can i just get it resurfaced by a pro to have it fixed
     i bought my copy of snatcher in 2015 and it had moderately sized circular scratches on the disc i only realised recently that these scratches affect track 8 of the cd audio and my disk image of the game actually replicates the track skipping like it were being played off the disc     i sold my copy being completely open about the nature of this game and still got about 500 its so bullshit that this wasnt rereleased in english
  kek i just checked those ebay prices and theyre huge jesus well i may actually try to get it professionally resurfaced if that doesnt work ill just sell it
  im not either but theyre consistently in top games lists
id also add android assault the revenge of bariarm and silpheed
  this started a new game earlier today
i also recommend shining force cd sol feace terminator soundtrack 10/10 ecco lunar 1  2 heart of the alien and sonic cd
    ugh heart of the alien is trash sorry even eric chahi seems to think so
final fight cd and the terminator    sonic cd is a shit sonic 1 romhack
  it still comes bundled with a good sega cd port of another world pretty much its sole selling point
  resurface it sell it then burn your own copy burned sega cd games are easy to play on original hardware
fewer than you can count on one hand the other curiosities wouldnt be noteworthy if the system was still current theyre only charming now because you have nothing to lose with emulation if you paid full retail price for most of these games people listed back then youd be pissed
  fewer than you can count on one hand  sorry you fell for the sega cd is an fmv machine meme
  thanks
  i fell for the sega cd has good games meme
not everything is a fucking meme you stupid tools
  i fell for the meme that not every meme is a meme
  ur gay
      listen to these guys until youve played snatcher and sonic cd dont bother playing anything else also ecco
the sega cd port of earthworm jim is along with the pc port the definitive best version of the game
slipheed soul star and robo aleste are the only noteworthy games on the platform  popful mail is a mediocre cashin if youre a shameless pedophile
  theyre all noteworthy most for being complete shit
time gal is noteworthy to my dick
  time gal for the mega cd is noteworthy to my dick going limp the only thing that could make it go limper is the sega cd version but thanks for bringing up such a good example of how shit the sega cd games are
  nigga you dont play that game you fap to the pictures
  sega does thicc which nintendont
  i fap to crayon drawing stick figure drawings when actual video exists  whatever floats your boat dude
lords of thunder is tight
  are there any differences with the saturn version
captain tsubasa    soccer/rpg/rts mix very neat pixel art too covers all the manga up to the middleschool final
  opening here     it has voice acting and all
  snatcher  sonic cd  final fight cd  lords of thunder  lunar silver star  lunar eternal blue  robo aleste  popful mail  shining force cd  dark wizard  android assault  earthworm jim special edition    you may also want to try  silpheed  keiko flying squadron  the terminator  soul star  batman returns but only play the racing parts  eternal champions cd  vay  jaguar xj220  rise of the dragon  space adventure cobra  thunderhawk  spiderman vs the kingpin  road rash  game no kanzume otokuyou  battlecorps    good game i wouldnt recommend the sega cd versions unless youre playing on an emulator with savestates and fastforward  the secret of monkey island
  maybe if i copy and paste some shit theyll think im old enough to post here  they didnt
  but its better on pc engine
why did it never have as big a cultural impact as starcraft despite ultimately being the winner in the test of time    also age of empires 2 thread
it wasnt as popular upon release
not enough action at the beginning of matches
floods your base
    because scifi settings are more culturally appealing than historic ones for the majority of people
we
  wuz
i never heard of starcraft until few years ago  aoe was way more popular back in the day at least among my friends and the pc magazines i bought  what do you mean with big cultural impact isnt just a korean thing
total annihilation  aoe  craft
  ever heard of kek  zerg rush
  kek  yes i played wow many years later  zerg rush  only on the interne according to urban dictionary the term is not older than 2004  as i said this was my experience i never knew or cared about starcraft while aoe monk jokes were heard even among normies
  well urban dictionary is wrong because zerg rushes were a thing since the late 90s
starcraft is more gookclick friendly and actiony
  people got it confused with the historical sims like ceasar and other management shit
  because history is boring for most people history buffs loved it but scifi shooting stuff is more exciting also the studio went under and lost its relevance
are you all fucking pulling my leg here  every person i know has played aoe ii at some point in his/her life its one of the few games that is still regularly talked about despite how old it is   while i dont deny starcrafts impact in rts its not as well known internationally as age 2
  total annihilation is the worst of all those
  i was thinking the same thing no one i knew ever talked about starcraft while virtually everyone knew aoe
  this all of my normie friends know about it and get the wololo reference
  blocks your path
    well thats the point people still fondly remember age of empires 2 but it was starcraft that made it among popular media and became a de facto national sport
it may not have been as popular as starcraft but i know that many people played aoe2 when it came out
20 years later starcraft still has an xbox hueg community  cc community is dead and aoe is barely surviving as a community thanks to the hd edition on steam
  huh  based on my experiences there are much more people who played starcraft and red alert 2 than ones that tried aoe 2
if only everyone who played aoe 1 played aoe 2 it would be even bigger didnt know until a couple years ago how much better 2 was
  all of my normie friends  yikes
  despite ultimately being the winner in the test of time    in what capacity broodwar still has many more players and far more active tournaments than aoe2
  it isnt
heres some points of discussion    1 project showoffs  2 hacking help  3 rom hack recommendations    our rom hack recommendation list can be found below        every hack featured on the list above can be downloaded at      
a little late on this news but ive finished stage 1 of nambonas revenge and on real hardware      and as an extra surprise ive decided to release a 1 level demo  
  you should fix your link for best sm64 hack ever made
  ill add the bestest sm64 hack ever made then
rom hack recommendation without the blog post this time    hyper metroid its fucking good peak upside lacks all the things that tend to irk me about sm hacks except for peak downside from my experience was larger maps making the backtracking aspects of super metroid a bit of a pain otherwise it was amazing and different enough that the original to feel like a whole new experience    while im at it do you guys know any other hacks for sm that are good ive heard super zero mission is neat but aside from that i dont hear much
any good smw hacks that loosely stick with the original style graphics with a new overworld and levels something youd see out of vldc for instance but follows the normal beat the level to continue formula
  heres a few  airy  ancient chozo  darkholme hospital opinions vary on this i personally like it  digital cube this one is just a short puzzle hack  eris  escape ii  ice metal uninstall  phazon hack  zfactor  yfaster  redesign axeil edition i cannot stress enough how much axeil edition improves redesign if you played the original a long time ago i urge you to give this version a shot
    thank you kind sir now that i think of it i do remember taking a look at eris ive seen a few of these names but plenty are new to me as well ill think about it on the redesign i knew a new version was released but damn my experience with the original was so frustrating
  hyper metroid  got missiles grapple beam morph ball and bombs then went to grab charge beam both doors locked gray and there are no enemies left to kill i can safely say ive had more fun with the randomizer than this hack at this point
  im keen for some smw hack recommendations too i trawled a few on smwcentral but didnt find any great ones that have a feel like the original game i guess im looking for a smw sequel type hack that isnt trivial or kaizo    also i remember reading about a /vr/ smw romhack collaboration a while back maybe 6 months  did that go anywhere if so does anyone have a link
reminder you should start a disassembly of your favorite game
  i dont think you looked hard enough  i figured it out in less than five minutes
  i did i started a lot of things  finishing things isnt what i do
  did you put it on github so other people can contribute
  dont overestimate what i mean by start    but on that note is there any interest for doing a /rhg/ disassembly
  yeah no
  yfaster  kraid shoots spikes at you
  its glorious
    what  said if youre playing a new classic style metroid game and not shooting everything/anything that looks suspicious then youre doing it wrong
      which hack has barf kraid again
what are some rom hacks with good story i want to experience something new but ive played most games with good story any console is fine
  shameless plug 
  why does the length say  7 exits  but the description says  6 exits 
  miscount its seven
has anyone checked out this new void divergence mod for final fantasy v    its changes all sorts of mechanics and adds many as well it might become the brave new world of ff5
im guessing the answer is no but is there any sort of romhack that gets rid of snes addon chip stuff from games to make the roms playable on an everdrive for example mega man x 2 and 3 use cx4 chips to do some 3d wireframe stuff im wondering if anyone has ever gone through and disabled/replaced these effects
where my new threat anons at
why is kaizo shit so popular who actually plays ugly levels that are mostly spikes and hidden boxes and that are almost impossible to finish its fucking stupid
  some players really dig that challenge
  this looks real good is it recent
  its a couple years old 2015
  of course not to do so would require extensive modification to remove all parts of the game that rely on the special chip the only thing like this im aware of is i think star ocean and all the chip did was compression so the hack just decompresses everything and expands the rom to fuckhuge size
  found another in the stop liking what i dont like crowd
   zopharnet/hacks/nes/legendofzelda2html    it lists a hack where you are zelda going to save link says there are a lot of changes in it
i only love mega man romhacks
  thanks i didnt mean it had to be zelda though anything with a good story would be great
  hes not saying dont like what i dont like hes saying why are there more impossibly hard and badly designed levels than there are normal playable levels which is a good question as only mad people want to savescum grind kaizo levels the answer of course is that the romhacking scene has a high proportion of mad people in it
i know this chart is old as fuck i saved it in 2016 but it provided me with some good original smw romhacks to play
  in terms of smw romhacks that stay true to smw in terms of style i recommend    1 super mario worldwide 2  2 return to dinosaur land  3 super moogle world
  so did anyone try it
  after the first thread got archived the main organizer behind the collab seemingly disappeared so it basically died there only 4 levels from 3 different posters  a few graphical changes were ever made you can get the latest baserom here        also the thread for reference    
  thats really not that many kaizo hacks though people just consider anything harder than the original game to be kaizo
the issue i find with many smw hacks is artificial difficulty there is no payoff for things like kaizo unless you have autism
    ive enjoyed it thus far my only issue is the music in the castle annoys the fuck out of me the little techno synth that loops over the castle music gives me a headache i liked the boss though a good change up idk if you made it or not but it is good didnt realize quite how to damage him until i died twice
  i was dragging my heels on playing yet another smw hack but this is actually really charming most hacks ive played are either boringly vanilla unrecognizable madness bolted on to the smw engine or somehow both this hits that sweet spot where it feels different but naturally so i look up and wonder if theres a secret and there it is i need a powerup but there doesnt seem to be one so i snoop around and there it is feels good    if id known it was going to be so solid i wouldnt have let you pay me so much for those assembly hacks
  dont bother i got to norfair and couldnt find fucking super missiles anywhere at that point i already had access to like 50 rooms so no shit i didnt bother rechecking them for that one hidden stash with the god damn super missiles
  ah shit nigger ill send you an email      youre the only one so far to mention the castle track so hm the boss was custom made yeah i was planning to change up the boss to be easier cause its world 1 but i thought it was intuitive enough myself
  goddamn you really suck at metroid
im trying to play the secret of mana gameplay improvement patch on my super everdrive china version and it gets a black screen on the save load menu everytime it plays music but theres a black screen    anyone else see this issue    really sucks because having the scroll fix would be really nice
  is the scroll fix even in the improvement patch i thought it was a separate patch
  is the scroll fix even in the improvement patch i thought it was a separate patch  ill look and see if i can find a separate scroll fix and use that i mainly wanted it for that the mp meter and the better cpu ai
    the separate scroll hack works fine it appears i will have to make do without the gameplay improvement patch i guess
  its a problem with modern platformers in general   they have no sense of balance they just stuff as many hazards onto the screen as possible then give you savestatelike checkpoints so that its not unplayable
  you know with snes you have to mind the headers its always the first thing to check if the patch isnt working the second thing is check for rom revisions
  if i can die then its instantly kaizo and its bad
sometimes i get so worked up playing kaizo i cant get to sleep without at least two joints    its so intense my friend was talking to me about it and hes real concerned he started weeping but i love the kaizo so much i cant quit
a guide to romhack difficulty since people seem to be confused    vanilla  on par with the original game in terms of challenge  you wont find many hacks like this since most romhackers make something they would enjoy and they tend to be experts at the game they are hacking    normal  much harder than the original game usually from the very start likely to require special techniques and skills the vanilla game doesnt  most common hack you will find these hacks are the reason most romhacks are considered hard mode hacks    kaizo  designed to be as hard as possible to play  less common than normal hacks but more common than vanilla hacks only masochists play this shit on real hardware everyone else savestates through and then says look what i beat
  having normal as a separate harder category from vanilla is fucking stupid normal and vanilla should be interchangeable and normal renamed to difficult  otherwise people just get confused
  nah man that is good for world 1 remember the smw boss in i think world 1 where you had to knock buddy into the lava not exactly easy    perhaps it was just my ears then
  but your average normal romhack is much harder than the original game this is the way things are you can scream that romhackers should change their naming to reflect difficulty better but they wont that is what they consider a normal hack
  i really enjoyed your romhack i played it a few months back i went through a whole bunch of romhacks looking for quality and a familiar smw feel and not being too difficult and yours was one of the few i found that fit that criteria kudos    have you updated it in the last few months the copy i played only had the first island        i actually really liked the castle music felt new/fresh but kept an original tune
    levels can be hard without invisible blocks and being 99 spikes and awkwardly placed enemies kaizo garbage is the definition of artificial difficulty
  can you tell me more about it the only ffv hack i played is the ancient cave one while i love it to death i kinda wish it had the localization upgrades so i dont play it as much as id like so was looking for something else ffv to try  i mean i can go and look for a point list of features but id prefer to hear the opinion of someone who played it you know a lot of those sound great but then arent what you expected
  well thats actually a bit of a composite problem you know how some games used to be hard as nails because the developers tested the game to death and kept finding it progressively easier to the point they had to up the challenge combine that with a player that knows the game even more than that then designs their own levels  the only way they are gonna consider it challenging is by making it a lot harder or to rely more on advanced techniques or exploits  its sadly a natural thing unless the thing has several testers of varying skill levels to keep things in check
  its turn based ffv with bdstyle turn building only incombat mp managementsince it fuels turns ccstyle field elements and new or rebalanced jobs equipment and abilities i wouldnt call it great yet certainly not on the level of the other ff hacks on that site but it has the potential to get there if its polished up
  sounds pretty cool ill check it out
note void divergence has had zero effort put into balance as of yet
  keep us updated id like to hear your opinion throughout the game
    how the fuck are you this bad
i am playing new threat and having a good time it makes ff7 a very engaging and deep experience
  but other people already disassembled my favorite game
  people just consider anything harder than the original game to be kaizo  you and i both know thats bullshit
  was it sm
  pokémon crystal ive messed with it a lot but never finished anything worth publicly posting besides music used in other hacks
what newer smw romhacks have been making rounds
  invictus but ive been annoyed with it going everywhere mainly because of some really shit things that happened between me and juzcook the author in january
want to play mario world romhack  realize ive already played the handful of good ones
  if my time in mario maker has taught me anything its that kaizo just means theres an invisible block somewhere
does anyone have experience with coilsnake or earthbound hacking in general  any idea what id need to do to have an alternate start
why should i play new threat why is it so good
  watches this  needs a non non biyori hack
  thatactually sounds pretty good ill give it a shot sometime around christmas
  i dont get the reference the edits are kinda cute tho
alright so i want to go through this game again and i want to know if any difficulty hacks are worth looking into i found something but the google results that i get are mixed
  i believe they call that part the flyover so search the resources for that term
void divergence is pretty fun so far
  really that good might try to put it on my pstv if possible
  can you play the pc version of ff7 on pstv
preview of stage 2 of nambonas revenge done savestateless with a new capture card and some asm showoff at the end  
  ahh shit my bad
  its ffvii with an equipment system that has some depth enemies that actually fight back character differences that go deeper than limits lots of new content and an actual dedicated character building system
  thanks anon its a shame it died im going to give this wip a play anyway
  well ive failed to get a working rom for this one tried lunar ips and flips patchers and tried patching 3 different smw roms but none worked am i missing something obvious
im not sure if this is the best place to ask but i need help regarding extracting sounds from wizards and warriors 3 for the nes normally id just reduce sound channels to isolate the sounds from the music but this game has the sounds and certain parts of the music on the same channel    is there anything that can be done
  nevermind im fucking retarded because those parts of the music and the sounds share a channel the sounds take priority giving me a gap to cleanly cut the sounds i want out  disregard me i suck cocks
  good now i dont have to suggest something complicated that likely wouldnt have worked anyways
  that sounds good
  whats this
  try this one        might not be the most up to date version but still it includes all four completed levels plus another one i was working on before the collab died
is there any way to inject sfcquality music tracks into the dragon quest games on the ds i love the graphics and music of the originals but the quality of life improvements on the ds ports are too much to resist theres only one problem literally all ds music is cancer  except eo
  how do i learn about it not retro but im surprised that theres no kirby and the amazing mirror hacks yet
how does one begin with romhacks for gen 2 pokemon
  start by downloading the crystal disassembly and building the original rom from it then start changing stuff
  thanks that one worked well quite fun levels some interesting gimmicks but not too hard wish /rhg/ had finished it
bumpin
got some really bad designers block right now  dont know what to add into the level    planning to make all the levels at least 2 minutes long but so far its only 1 minute long    whats done of the level so far 
  cool
  you might wanna try designing good levels that usually prevents me from having block
  this fuck off with your outdated meme kaizo shit
  make a hack so that bad players like me can enjoy it something smw special zone difficulty for those that can finish the game but arent particularly good  youre welcome for the inspiration
  outrageous is harder than any smw hack to be quite honest with you
  do you mean tubular because even that isnt harder
  i found tubular the hardest and its easier than a lot of hacks ive attempted to play
actually just had an idea  in the next section ill have sprites go through layer 2 and also have the horizontal level wrap enabled so that when you go above the top of the screen you come out the bottom and vice versa
  tubular can be memorized since its not a rng clusterfuck
  maybe you can have a section where it looks impossible to pass through but if you do some tricky difficult maneuvers that seem impossible to execute then you can make it through
  oh my
  
waiting for final fantasy viii new threat
damn it second reality project re is kicking my ass  damn it this is a hard hack
hi is there anyone who can compose ports to insert into smw using amk asking because id like to have an unsampled version of this machine from sonic heroes
stage 2 is complete  
  autism
  thanks for the feedback
  at 20 seconds in cant you just crouchjump up along into the munchers to shrink yourself instead of needing to get the poison mushroom
  red munchers kill you instantly regardless of whether you have a powerup or not
  ah i see i guess ive only seen the regular yellow ones before do the other color munchers have other properties
  purple munchers hurt mario but let sprites through  green munchers instantly kill mario but let sprites through
  wait a minute ff8
any noteworthy sm64 romhacks that work on real hardware via flashcart     do the final fantasy v/vi gba music hacks replacing the iffy gba music with the snes music work on real hardware and if so how exactly my understanding is that the reason for the gba ffs shittier music was because of an inferior soundchip do the romhacks just add prerecorded snes tracks or what
crab
anyone still interesting in composing sonic heroes  this machine for smw using smws samples please
  why do you keep posting these when no one likes your shit like take a good long look at this level in one part youre keeping an enemy alive by pressing on/off blocks at the right time and in another part youre fucking about with vertical screen wrap and gravity these are ideas that could easily be the main gimmick of their own levels but instead youre awkwardly blending them together resulting in a shitty unfocused level just because its kaizo doesnt mean you should try out all conventions of proper level design tldr fuck off faggot
  i like his levels i dont understand the hatred for his levels other than some rumor about making bad doom levels or somethings and permanently prejudging him on that
of all the translations that gideon zhi sat on for 8 years which should bhdn hack now
  will this hack be publicly available im interested in trying it out
  madara 2
  id say goemon 2 since turnbased shit is dull although i dont care about playing it  i kinda rather see time twist for fds translated since theres jew themes and black lynching themes but i know i wont play it since i dont care
  still waiting on ganbare goemon 24 and retrans of mystical nigga
  i definitely did make a lot of trolly doom levels but not really anymore
  i like seeing videos of his levels id never bother playing them but posting them played out is kinda neat you do have a point though he could focus on things like themes and just making it look better and it would improve the levels immensely
  the current level im working on has a cape theme to it so its not mostly a variety pack like the first two levels
  i want to see it
  well youre in luck because i just finished a playthrough of the first half  
  awww the music is so beautiful
  had a hard time trying to find a good song to use
what are some romhacks about bumping threads
  this one i guess
    i cant answer your question entirely but i do know that the music/soundfix for gba ffvi adds full orchestration and voice to the opera house performance as a personal touch by the creator of the patch
some of those soundhacks are a little weird like that ff6 soundhack that turns the battle theme into its metal version
hows metroid rogue dawn i just remembered it existed today and the only thing i can remember about it is that the graphics looked kind of nice
  this ill never understand adding unfitting music to games how jarring does it have to be before you stop
  its excellent the story is very fanficy but it doesnt detract from the great atmosphere and smooth gameplay
im waiting for return of the dark sorcerer
i just want this to be released in english    
  ie half a mind to just play this with my zero knowledge of jp i dont care    ill figure it out
baddest hacks is down anyone know why
  how long has it been down
  since at least this morning
  admin said dns error  might be up tomorrow
  cool thanks
damnit i hate ice
  the second reality project  ice is the least of your worries
are any jrpg rom hacks worth it like in new story  settings / etc
  new story thats a tall order    but when it comes to favourite jrpg romhacks id say new threat brave new world alternate fantasy and super mario armegeddon are the best
bump
  well have you played dragoon x omega 1  2 yet
ive been pretty active in the smw romhacking scene from 2010 to 2012 ive made a prepatched romhack pack and a few charts for example the one  posted but since then ive been out of the loop what are some great smw romhacks that have come out since 2013 im talking something that can parallel masterpieces like smw23 tsrp2 etc
  heres an image of my mediafire folder just to not look like some fake shithead
  umm that image doesnt prove anything especially cuz you just showed 3 compressed files  an actual mediafire link would be more proof
  alright here you go then    i guess this still makes for a good collection its just outdated
  neat thx i was just bullying anyway
  no problem lad enjoy the prepatched romhacks you also have two charts there
i believe in the power of the romhack
that 30 year old boomer who still plays brutal mario
  why the hell not its a good hack even if its unfinished
  mediocre level design  bosses/gimmicks feel cheap    i dont get the love for this hack
  these goddamned kids and their newfangled toolsback in my day we didnt have all these sprite tools and addmusics we had trasm and boy did it do its job we didnt need a goddamned overhaul for trasm but then this goddamned new generation needed a better assembler a better assembler as if that were possible what kind of goddamned tomfoolery are these goddamned kids trying to pull on us older folks brutal mario didnt need your goddamned pixie or gippy or whatever goddamned tool you goddamned teenagers are using today i cant even keep track of it goddammit what kind of name even is pixie what is tinker bell just going to magically solve all your goddamned problems goddamned kids always relying on fairy tales it never changes these goddamned teenagers are always causing a ruckus for us old folks and goddammit they make this shit too hard for older folks im an old man sonny do i look like i know what a goddamn sa1 remap is i just want my good ol reliable yoshis island sprites and you little goddamned rascals cant even convert the goddamned yi ball n chain the ball and chain goddammit that was a classic back in my day and your newfangled gadgets cant even add it into your hacks anymore because your new little gadgets cant even support the goddamn thing just work with me boy its not that hard to go back to the old ways goddammit just give me back my goddamned trasm these goddamned kids dont know squat about how the oldies did it oldschool
    hope you guys dont mind of this peach
huh that ffv void divergence hack isactually pretty cool  i just wish it had some form of ancient cave built in because damn id play that to death
  why
  this hack needs a name    it is like super mario world but in an alternate dimension
  super mario elseworld  super other world
        theres a 99 complete goemon 2 sfc translation dds translation is sitting on since 2014 or so because the lead translator/image editor avicalendriya wont allow it to be released unfinished    itll surely be released at some point in some form    theres also this rai who has been appearing on an off on message boards since 2012 showing some progress on hacking goemon 3 and 4 sfc  heres the last i saw anything from him in 2016    not too sure about this one but its the closest thing to an actual translation project for those two games    personally my most wanted goemon translation is the first ps1 game the one that plays a lot like goemon 3 sfc and has two new characters instead of yae and sasuke
  im working on it on and off expect it to be finished around late december though not planning on making it too short but dont expect much content
  fat toadstool  plays this game  ahh my pingy
what smw hacks wont break in snes9xgx a ton of the ones i tried get brokenass music
  i assume most modern hacks could be played on modern hardware
  either hacks that dont have custom music or hacks with custom music that were made after 2014
  hi /vr/ can you help me a bit  im looking for a hard super mario world rom hack but not at the crazy level of kaizo like pretty hard but fair there is something like that or i should try to play kaizo until i smash my keyboard against the wall
i finally added a new section to my level after a week of designers block yay  
  i like
  second reality project
  well youll be happy to hear that i just finished it  
but who was romhack
  carol
  yes this was done in game    i used an level editor to move the block over and the goomba away  then i drew the graphics 4 tiles for both states since the brick uses only two tiles i placed the this post graphics over the pipe graphics and the bump tiles over the beetle ones as the hit block is a sprite and the game uses 8x8px tiles the sprites can only use the sprite half of the tiles  the available documentation had the tile makeup of the brick so that was easy to change but there is a routine that changes the tiles to make the block disappear when hit spawns a sprite version of the brick block to do the bouncing part then changes the tile back to the brick graphics after its done so even if you change the tiles they just turn back to normal after you hit the block  to fix this i set a write breakpoint on the ppu memory for that tile hovering over the tile in the name table viewer tells me what address it lives at the break triggered in the middle of a generic write_these_tiles_here function so i repeated the process i looked at where it got the value it was trying to write checked out that memory address and set a breakpoint there when that one triggered i looked at where it was coming from at this chunk of memory i noticed a 45 47 45 47 which was the tiles of the brick block i was looking for i changed it and it worked the graphics changed to the new tiles after being hit  for the sprite i took decided to try searching for 85 86 85 86 the tiles for the sprite version of the brick block unfortunately there were no results found however i tried changing the order 85 85 86 86 and found only one result i changed it and it was what i hoped it was    after a screen capture and trimming the footage the result was this webm    if you would like to try doing something of similar scope feel free to ask and maybe we can walk you through how to do it
    thats way too long to be useful    what are the top 5 smw hacks for instance for a newb to try having already 100ed the vanilla games
  gamma vs hacks are decent if you want something nintendolike and not being too difficult
does super mario land 2 dx work on the super game boy with all the correct coloring etc
  no sml2dx is basically a gbconly game
  sgb isnt really capable of displaying colors to the extent of a fullcolor platformer thats why you see games like kirby and mega man with the character and the whole stage the same color
i love gameboys original colours
  b/w and two greys
  this could have been cute instead of fetish creepy if she just had a big poofy dress
  based boomer old guys rule
  i think he means the green monochrome pea soup color
any good megaman or metroid style roms
checking out the quality hack kind of neat never noticed the women on the pillars before     it crashes when i try to go to the next room
  which emulator i havent tested it on my psx yet so i dunno if it works on real hardware or not worked under epsxe for me though had no crashes during the short time i tested it i think i saved a ways past that point but id have to check
    mednafen hw
its a write epic swear words into all the dialogue hack
japan has a pretty solid romhacking community but its mostly separate from the english speaking one and worse there seems to be no attempt at cataloguing or keeping track of them    from a previous thread   we got a few    jp romhack page        tactics ogre romhacks        ff6t edition

  i read his smwcentral profile page and wanted to cringe vomit
anyone here work with the sa1 chip    anyone here have any general advice for someone trying to make a game work with the sa1    ive been off and on hacking brainlord for quite a few years now the game suffers from a extremely bad lag issue that pops up now and then and i havent been able to pinpoint exactly what is causing the lag    went to smwc for the first time in ages and saw the sa1 patch and everything useful that it does and went and dug around a bit for some information on it and it seems like trying to make brainlord run some of its main processes off the sa1 chip would be extremely beneficial   however i cant find much information on it in regards to general information on how to make a game possibly work with it    from what i understand if you set the rom up to act as if it has a sa1 chip everything should work fine just like that but nothing will change or benefit from it until i change some of the algorithms in the rom to calculate something using the sa1 instead of the default snes cpu   so id need to tear the engine apart and try to make some of the more intensive things use the sa1 to calculate something instead of the onboard  but thats as far as my knowledge about the sa1 goes so far
  this is why the only sa1 hacks you see are music replacers bad ones at that
  music replacers  thats msu sa1 is completely different chip
  fuck  i had this nagging feeling in the back of my mind that i was mixing something up too  ill be in the corner if you need me
  what the other poster said is right what youre thinking of is the msu chip which is essentially a rom expansion meant for streaming data music is a prime example    the sa1 chip is a second processor thats roughly 4x faster than the main snes cpu with some built in goodies like a bit of extra ram and sram
  yooo ended up trying it and this shit is tight its clearly incomplete some stuff like dark knight are clearly placeholders but im having a fuckton of fun with this    how come nobody is talking about this no youtube vids or forums discussions or anything i can find at a glance
  no worries dude im glad you can take criticism you know as a side note people on 4chan even on /b/ are a lot nicer than a lot of other places i play dota2 and other multiplayer games and most people are assholes maybe its because of anonymity
  people like to call 4chan the cesspool of the internet but there actually are a lot of nice people here you see more of them on the slower boards
  you say that but the moment theres even a hint in any post that youre a tranny you get a lot of shit thrown your way regardless of what board youre on meanwhile everywhere else on the internet acts like a echo chamber of ceaseless and needless white knights  its just a example but 4chan is tolerable to you if you act normal to a anonymous standard of sorts  the rest of the internet is similar but the standard is different if you try to mention how dumb the echo chambers of each site is you still get shit thrown your way in a similar manner    if you can find a place with people that fit for you thats great even if that does happen to be considered the cesspool of the internet
  youre a tranny  be gone you ugly deviant and take your shitty hack with you
kek    is there any rom hack that has a goodtodecent story with an original cast of characters preferably one based off a game that had none of that whether its smw or anything else
    goodtodecent story with an original cast of characters but isnt based off a game that had none of that
  you should try a simple slowrom to fastrom header hack to see if that resolves any of the issue and move onto sa1 based on your results sa1 hacks require more work due to them needing to change more than a couple lines of code to run optimized
  i suppose i shouldve said it in the original post but brainlord already runs with fastrom so sadly thats not a option   im aware trying to make it work with the sa1 chip would be quite a bit more involved but it seems like its the only real option i have besides trying even further to figure out the cause of the lag and perhaps optimizing it  though from my findings it could be any number of things so thatd be a huge pain  a upside to attempting to make it work with the sa1 is if i do end up doing it itd give me more to work with for future hacks i decide to do with the game which would be pretty great as well    but yeah nah fastrom is already enabled i dont have much of a option but to try the sa1 route
  we cant really continue this conversation because this thread or board isnt for discussing this but i will say that a lot of /b/tards and even /pol/tards love trannies   i do agree with the rest of your post   that being said are you a tranny and have you got an interest in rom hacking       agreed i rarely have arguments here and i rarely get upset at anything in fact the only times i get upset are when the russian bots over on /b/ start spamming or sliding anti trump threads
  we cant really continue this conversation because this thread or board isnt for discussing this but i will say that a lot of /b/tards and even /pol/tards love trannies  they love us in the sense that they like the idea of having sex with the more attractive ones they dont really see us as dating material  i think its partially for good reason a lot of us arent all that right in the head and demand the world be handed to us but i strongly believe in giving everyone the chance to be known and its sad to see a lot of people dont think the same  i was just trying to make a general point that 4chan just seems nice if you fit within its norms like any other place  though 4chan does have more room for outcasts but not as much room as many seem to think  regardless yeah youre right this isnt the place for it     have you got an interest in rom hacking   yea im the poster up above looking for sa1 advice  im 27 now and have been off and on rom hacking since i was 14 or so the zelda64 games is what got me into it when i went into hacking the gba pokemon games for a few years  at some point i ended up adopting brainlord as my rom hacking love child and i tore the game apart and documented a bunch of stuff most of the stuff on brainlords cutting room floor page is due to my contributions  though my work isnt constant i have a pretty poor attention span    theres something absolutely amazing about taking a game you used to enjoy and just ripping it apart to learn more about it you notice things about you might have never originally noticed and you can sometimes appreciate the tricks the devs had to pull to make some things work  its a lovehate hobby since getting into the grits of it can be painful but its still a fun hobby to go back to now and then    do you have any neat works youve done
  aaah i see i gotta agree with you i have noticed some of the stuff youve talked about in many of the boards   do you have any neat works youve done  no unfortunately not however i do want to learn more and create my own romhacks in the future especially for smw and smb3 if possible hence why i am here in this thread i am sick and tired of the competitive games ive spent the majority of the past 2 years playing overwatch dota 2 league counter strike etc  i want to actually have fun while playing games again and not rage at some retard on my team who doesnt know how to push a button on his keyboard at the appropriate time which pretty much sums all of the above games   what sucks is ive probably spent upwards of like 120 on dota2 skins and passes just in the past year alone money down the drain but oh well
  like i said rom hacking is a lovehate hobby   you can definitely gain a deeper appreciation for games you work on and you can definitely have a lot of fun with it but if you start getting into assembly trying to get things to work just the way you want can be a huuuge chore its super rewarding when you can finally pull it off though  smwc is a great site and im sure theyd be able to help with anything you have issues with in terms of smw hacking  the persons themselves can be questionable from time to time but they are pretty passionate welcoming and tend to try to help others more than other communities     competitive gaming  yeah i can understand all that its definitely the biggest reason i havent tried to do anything competitive in years when you have to rely on a team to win people just dont like to work together very often ends up in frustration    goodluck with your rom hacking journey smw/smb3 are great places to start so i think youre definitely off on the right foot
i have experience hacking nes and snes games so ive moved onto ps1 im starting out with translating summon night on ps1 just as a way to learn the ps1 architecture and to gain some experience with ps1 hacking though this isnt hardcore hacking by any means once i get familiar ill try to do some fun shit like randomizers etc
im not much of a review guy but sm oxide is alright i give it a 7/10     barf kraid was a good laugh
giving super metroid escape ii a whirl  authors favourite colour must be blue  about to enter ridleys room on the space station  or not    wtf cant even enter the door i wonder if higan shits the bed for this particular romhack
  nah it just pulls something stupid  its been such a long time since ive played escape ii that i dont remember if it pulls anything else like this along the way  but there definitely is a lot of blue in the game i remember that much
4channelbump
  i liked that keytastrophe hack not too hard but clever kinda short
  have you tried the call of cthulhu its the greatest romhack for smw   inb4 edgy contrarians
ok so i read through lunar magics help file and it seems like you cant use the palette export feature to generate useful pals for yychr since even a masked palette still exports all colors to the file instead you still need to use zsnes savestates  im not missing any workarounds to this right
  you can     open palette editor on lunar magic  press export level palette to file red star with green arrow pointing to right  save the file to somewhere as pal  on yychr press paletteopen palette  select the pal file you saved
  i know but that exports way too much yychr only imports the first few palettes and unless i somehow missed it doesnt import the player palette
  uhh you know theres scroll bar right there
i wonder if theres anyone here from metconst  this contest is gonna be hype
  there used to be someone here from metconst dunno if theyre still around
anyone know how to edit mode7 graphics im trying to edit the planet from the ending of sm but even though it uses 8bpp graphics it has a 16 color palette for some reason
  sorry but your romhack seems like a gimmicky kaizo clone that you would find in mario maker   you can at least start by retexturing shit and not focus on making the romhack difficult for the sake of difficulty
  any good smw hacks that loosely stick with the original style graphics with a new overworld and levels  thats literally 90 of smw romhacks
i hope the whole fucking rom hacking community dies in a fucking fire  fuck all of you
  this man is right
  i should have clarified mainly the smw hacking community
    why is it that everyone who dislikes the smw hacking community is so unhealthily obsessed with it
  whats this from looks good
    nambonas revenge for smb
accidentally type romhackernet instead of romhackingnet into bar  it actually leads somewhere    what the fuck is this shit
  i think its supposed to be the nesticle pointer
  romhackernet doesnt bring up shit for me
    romhackersnet
  i think sm74 has a version that does albeit its pretty laggy     the current hacks like star revenge 35 or sm sapphire are much much better though even surpassing vanilla
are there any good simons quest hacks
any asm programmers here willing to work on a smw hack for money mostly custom sprite/boss work prices can be negotiated
did brutal mario ever get finished i remember playing it back in 2011 and it was the coolest thing ever with all those custom bosses
  how ambitious is the project
  its a hack that takes mostly after the original smw so not overly ambitious eight worlds some bonus stuff i mostly just need simple enemies and the custom bosses are about as complicated as standard mario bosses as well as some other minor stuff like a new bonus game
  yeah its definitely the nesticle pointer thats just what we need more people glorifying the trash released in that era
make a kaizo mario 2  schedule a race a week after releasing it prize 200  everyone says this is the first mario 2 hack ever made  everyone playing it     thoughts
   not just typing rhdn into the search bar
why does no one do hacks of arcade games  i think theres potential
  you need to know the hardware to make a good romhack but learning it to hack just one game or a handful in the best case scenario is not appealing to most people
  theyre hard to distribute due to mames splitrom nature  you cant just make a patch and call it a day and you cant distribute your modified roms outright in most places because the admins of those places will be up your ass over the slim possibility of legal backlash
  nah there are simple solutions for that 
  why is that romhacking site filled to the brim with trojans do people just put up fake hacks to try and get people to download malware you would think the site would scan files uploaded to it or something
  post example link
  can i get a link to your discord or some shit  im not a great asm hacker but id like to hang out to possibly contribute and learn more ive done a few snes/nes hacks but nothing too big ie having mario all stars boot straight to mario bros 3
does anyone here know how to fix the spritenumberrelated slowdowns in snes9x im just trying to play some hacks off smw central but things slow to a crawl as soon as there are more than 67 sprites onscreen
  guess so vert2479
  sweet an unknown romhack site time to check out some underground hacks  only hack on whole site penisade a hack of renegade 3
  i bet thats the sekret club that was dramaed up a while ago when somebody noticed how shitty rhdn could be
    this one got instantly flagged as a trojan when i tried to dl it
  thats just a false positive theres nothing to fear
  he uses ms antivirus  it flags it since he uses some direct dos style patching program ms antivirus also flags tools for changing serials or cracking programs guess what you dont have to use the three presetup patching exe files included in the zip you can just patch normally using the ips files if you dont trust it    get a real antivirusnot mcafee or prove the exe files contained within are actually loading viruses dont make accusations just because you dont know how to use a pc
  no thanks good sites dont give false positives and only a retard would risk it also plenty of other people seem to be able to upload mods without false positives the only intelligent thing to do is not use such a site by using it if you did get malware it is 100 your fault i would not suggest anyone use the site and ive already told numerous people not to    fix your shit m8
  this site is full of viruses because ms told me so  ok prove it  no it needs to be fixed reeeee  how do you fix something that was never broken and only looks broken because someone is being retarded
is there a warcraft 2 for android
  i didnt realize my uncle was browsing /vr/
  yeah the tos reads like an rhdn counterculture    posts are fairly recent maybe itll take off who knows
  done two already sonic 1 sms and elite c64
  nice
bumping past the flood of shit threads
  my dick is confused
  whats the one from your pic related
i hacked breath of fire ii
  gave shaman katts charge to original katt because taunt is shit higher damage coefficients and 1/4 chance to instagib nonbosses can make bosses so though was pretty hard to hack because in the end there was hardcoded shit but now i can even make her charge/attack at once  can change monster groups in every dungeon location can make a group of any monsters  can attach unique random encounter function to any dungeon location that is can make random encounter rate depend on any factor already made several functions
  made it so a new random encounter function can properly display a monster activity indicator based on what the function is supposed to do  can change crit chance algorithm to whatever changed to scale with luck stat up to 50 at 256 max 255)))  can change buff spells coefficients to whatever not neccessary a constant  made it so every equippable item can have a 16 bit signed stat modifier all item bonuses now go to the one big variable instead of being truncated halfways  can change item descriptions to whatever not neccessary a constant text can paint it red and insert games special characters
  which ones are those
paper mario pro mode doesnt work on actual hardware  this is why you test your romhacks with a flash carts or have someone with a flash test it for you
  good stuff man    random encounter rate based on facing direction  silly and nonsensical no brilliant more enemies when going deeper into the cave fewer when retreating
  did you not notice the snes 2player final fight hack i never even knew this was being worked on   
  its based on whether theres nina in the party and she is not kod and its just a test  based on facing direction  this is a good idea combined with modded environtment
  very pointless  just play final fight 2
  romhackersnet  thus it begins
create mario 2 romhack  promise to host race with 200 bounty to the winner  shill to everyone on twitch  romhack becomes popular everyone says first ever mario 2 romhack  cancel the race with the 200 payout  is this a smart move to increase popularity of your romhack

  the developer is a cunt heres some of the things hes doing    trigger happy mods ban everything on their discord that isnt sucking the games dick that includes legitimate bug reports and all forms of criticism    speaking of discord the developer freaked the fuck out thinking he was going to get cdd when a big name youtuber gushed about how good his game was he went into delete everything mode and gets salty if you post the rom or even talk about it outside the discord    the developer uses an open source disassembly and takes features from other hacks like prism then makes his hack closed source so nobody can datamine his precious dlc codes    dlc codes yeah the dude has a patreon and if you donate you get a password for a special event pokemon like maybe a shiny or mythical    someone asked him to remove music they contributed from the hack because they didnt like the way it was going then the dev was like yes maybe in the next version the next version isnt coming out and the hack is on indefinite hiatus or so he says he also didnt bother replacing the music in the current build even though it would have been piss easy    self inserts so many self inserts including the elite four
  jesus romhackers are such self important children
  the dude has a patreon and if you donate you get a password for a special event pokemon like maybe a shiny or mythical  speaking of discord the developer freaked the fuck out thinking he was going to get cdd  given he is actually trying to profit off of a pokemon romhack he should be fucking worried am2r got cd for less

i have many questions about this genre more particularly the arena shooters answer whichever ones you feel like answering     why do you guys think this genre died out   what was your favorite arena shooter   what is your favorite doom or doom clone type game   are there any more unconventional unique retro fps games you feel deserve more attention   does an arena shooter have to play like quake or unreal to be considered good   what is your opinion on modern games that claim to be like retro fps games do they actually do a good job of emulating them or no   do you think the genre could ever truly make a comeback
halo killed it
  to be fair half life was the beginning of the end halo just finished em off
  gitting real gud takes too long for people these days
   why do you guys think this genre died out  because fps became more popular on consoles after goldeneye and halo and that severely limits how you can make an fps  what was your favorite arena shooter  quake 3 the goat  what is your favorite doom or doom clone type game  probably duke 3d if that counts as a doom clone  are there any more unconventional unique retro fps games you feel deserve more attention  strife one of the best and most interesting fps of the 90s but not many people have played it it came out in 96 and ran on the doom engine so it was overshadowed by duke and quake when it came out   does an arena shooter have to play like quake or unreal to be considered good  to be good arena shooters yes    what is your opinion on modern games that claim to be like retro fps games do they actually do a good job of emulating them or no  its very rare they do a good job of it ion maiden actually looks pretty good though   do you think the genre could ever truly make a comeback  if it does it will remain very niche todays video game market rewards a certain play style and games that focus purely on gameplay and challenge dont sell well compared to cinematic moviebased games and whackamole multiplayer
  and that severely limits how you can make an fps    it honestly doesnt considering quake games were ported to consoles
people were done with grindhouse and wanted scifi or military games with class or rpg elements or pure tactical elements over fun level design    doom    ultimate doom    shogo    not necessarily having neat aspects that are unique to the game are what make them interesting    some are fun some are boring what i hate is every fps since farcry 3 feels it has to have a microrpg aspect to it when it doesnt fucking need it    indies try to hard to bring it back by making a game thats obviously trying to hard to be retro aesthetically       halo was the last game in it it had all the elements of a classic fps and only added shields otherwise everything about it was classic it was when the market steered closer to cod/battlefield games and away from pure arena shooters
  arena/classic/doom clone fps genre  posts nonretro game that helped kill arena shooters  kys op
  implying people primarily play quake on consoles
  ported to consoles as an afterthought they accepted that the games were made primarily if not exclusively with pc in mind while the console versions were easy extra money for low effort the same reason most games get ported
    halo was more of an arena shooter than what came after
  thankyou
  why do you guys think this genre died out  people like to blame whatever got big see halo halflife cod etc but the reality is that the genre was starting to shift away from the doom clone formula by the time those games rolled around    does an arena shooter have to play like quake or unreal to be considered good  not necessarily but whatever arena shooter that comes out will always be compared to unreal or quake and will ultimately never get a chance off the top of my head there were like 3 or 4 arena shooters that came out in last 5 years that pretty much flopped    what is your opinion on modern games that claim to be like retro fps games  i like that it pretty much lead to a renaissance of single player shooters especially since until esports die multiplayer games are pretty much gonna suck    do they actually do a good job of emulating them or no  i dont really care if they do or do not at the end of the day you cant go home again and if i wanted to play classic doom id just play classic doom    do you think the genre could ever truly make a comeback  ut4 was probably the last best attempt at a revival in a multiplayer capacity that said i do believe that it can happen if people want it enough but unfortunately thats not the case currently
  ut4 was probably the last best attempt at a revival in a multiplayer capacity that said i do believe that it can happen if people want it enough but unfortunately thats not the case currently  i can respect them for letting dedicated servers be a thing id be more forgiving of qc if they let players set up their own servers
    i wanted to like ut4 so much because i fucking loved 99 and 2k4 but its biggest problem was it lacked maps and mutators that made the others so iconic and fun to play i didnt like q3 at all growing up but i actually love qc only because it reminds me of the pace of the older ut games even if it has special abilities toxikk tried but had like 2 maps that people played nobody plays sauerbraten anymore
  the big reason i like qc is because i love the aesthetics and background and its fun i also like some of the tracks like the old blood covenant theme and the new netherworld track
    qc  please fucking end yourselves and go back to /v/
  sure thing gramps
  if the only thing you noticed in a good steak was the shitty potatoes on the side then youre going to have a bad time in life
  if you cant notice what an unmitigated trash fire qc is youre going to have a bad time in life  muh aesthtics muh backgrounds  incidental shit like well cooked potatoes next to a shitty steak if your first fps is overwatch i guess i can understand eating shit like qc and wanting seconds
  fuck overwatch its a decent game but its overrated as fuck quake champions is the closest thing to a modern arena shooter we have who cares if characters have abilities if you can work a rocket launcher good enough it shouldnt matter
  its already having a comeback
  fuck overwatch its a decent game  seriously go back to /v/  quake champions is the closest thing to a modern arena shooter we have  and its still a shit interpretation of the genre catered to 10 year olds like yourself  who cares if characters have abilities  people who just wanted a straight no bullshit successor to quake 3 thats who cares  if you can work a rocket launcher good enough it shouldnt matter  if thats the case then why should there be faggy hero abilities for people who suck at arena fps    hopefully you can lodge bethesdas cock from your anus to adequately explain why you enjoy eating shit
   the guy that hosts the only active servers on q3 that are modded sniper matches that are shit for anyone that hasnt been on the server since it started 84 hours like this guy
  no point in arguing with people like him he can only see things as perfect or shit
   why do you guys think this genre died out  new ideas came along   what was your favorite arena shooter  ut2k4   what is your favorite doom or doom clone type game  rise of the triad   are there any more unconventional unique retro fps games you feel deserve more attention  kens labyrinth because its the build engine before the build engine nitemare 3d because it was hugos house of horror step into fps   does an arena shooter have to play like quake or unreal to be considered good  no tribes was awesome   what is your opinion on modern games that claim to be like retro fps games do they actually do a good job of emulating them or no  cant say ive tried any   do you think the genre could ever truly make a comeback  it has in a way but i dont think well ever see our definition of classic arena shooters come back to the mainstream
  i thought kens labyrinth was the game that came before wolf 3d and was simple casting with spooky monsters in a comb and spells from your hand wasnt the build engine after doom1
  youre thinking of catacomb 3d and yeah the build engine came after the doom engine
  haha ur autistic  nice argument    not point in arguing with people who accept eating mediocre shit and have no selfrespect
   that kid that didnt pass his eagle scout board of review
  yelling at anons because they like a thing because of opinions they already know about even agree with to a certain degree is pretty autistic
  that kid that thinks his reddittier replies are clever    getting defensive over being called out for having bad taste is really pathetic
   reddit users   achieving eagle scout   beating doom 2   achieving anything    theyd only play doom if doom guy was trans
  youre literally attacking people for liking something you dont    you are never going to convince anybody like that regardless of if you think youre right or not
  what was your favorite arena shooter  ut 2004 halflife deathmatch  halo reach    what is your favorite doom or doom clone type game  doom  blood    are there any more unconventional unique retro fps games you feel deserve more attention  i always felt there are more modern shooters like that that get overlooked than retro    i feel like even outside the bubble of /vr/ most retro shooters get talked about to death
  i loved reach but i feel like that was the least arena of the first 5 halo games
  i like reach because it played more like the first game healthpacks no dual wield etc but with better balancing    sure there were armor abilities but they werent gamebreaking and everyone had accesses to them at spawn also loadouts were only really reserved for specialized modes like firefight or invasion
  nice the janitors deleted the op pic
  it did feel a lot like the first one with a splash of borderlands but in a way that didnt make it something it wasnt it felt like halo 2 with rainbowsix vegas in a good way because it was a fun game
  it was an arena shooter just a really bad one  genre built around swift movement and item/weapon control  make a game where youre slow as dick and can only carry 2 weapons
  i only play ql these days but qc whether or not you agree with the more gimmicky champions idea is by far the best commercial attempt at a mainstream arena shooter all the pros from q3 have switched to it and maybe thats more because thats where the money is now but they have nothing but good things to say about the game
  quake and quake2 were mutilated pretty badly in the process of porting it wasnt a powerslave deal that the port was unique spin on the game made with care it was some other game wearing skin of quake
  i feel like even outside the bubble of /vr/ most retro shooters get talked about to death  i rarely see discussion of games outside the id/build engine even mainstream games like avp are never mentioned that basically leaves the entire market without discussion
im sorry but suikoden ii is a masterpiece
i like 1 better
one of the only two jrpg i bother to complete miles better than any ff of that era better gameplay better characters better plot better minigames
  im sorry but its overrated af
tried to play 1 was too disgusted by the writing to continue after less than an hour never happened with any other jrpg before
  whats wrong with it
  t only played the game when i was 9 and i only watch anime books are for losers
  just a salty final fantasy fan    ps they are all shit no exception even tactics is boring after a while
say it with me  best jrpg of the 5th generation
  t projecting pseud
  how a game with such a shitty gameplay can be rated so high is beyond me what an overrated game
  except most gaming pubblications gave better scores to final fantasy games than suikoden only now with the internet actual players can finally give the superior game its due recognition  how such a shitty gameplay can be rated so high is beyond me what an overrated series  stay seething ffag
  it has some slow parts and relies heavily on flirting with the original but yeah what it does good it does extremely well
   pic actually related
  sorry that i have standards and expect a game to have good gameplay even the story isnt that great and it goes downhill after luca dies     stay seething ffag    nice projection fag
    only up until lucca was defeated everything about jowy was just retarded and gay    we have to keep the war going even though we both know it was malarky and are both in positions where we can stop it muh destiny waaaaaaaah nevermind that your grandfather was already able to tell the same destiny to get fucked and there doesnt really seem to be any major reason why the rune of beginning even has to be united    oh and lets not forget the part where nanami was all    im tired of the war so instead of telling you this im going to pretend to die putting you through unimaginable pain at the loss of losing your only family     man fuck the good ending
  name some good gameplay jarpigs
  its a this tragic character turned into a villain but is cast in a weirdly sympathetic light by the end of the game episode
it truly is op
  jrpgs are all fucking trash
  gamecucks
  relies heavily on flirting with the original    why is this a problem though part of what makes suikoden cool and unique is that its stories and characters persist across games narratives and character arcs unfold over the course of multiple games the biggest problem with it is that because the series ended with 5 there are narrative loose ends but its a very cool way of telling stories and developing a world
  art of what makes suikoden cool and unique is that its stories and characters persist across games    he means stuff like bringing neclord back for no reason its fine to have some series expansion fluff to flesh out the world but making us redo entire quest lines is just more a pain int he ass especially when it really just gets in the way of pacing
  thats a good point retreading that plotline is probably the worst part of suikoden 2 there was no reason to do it except to pad out the game
    and while not exactly a retread of anything in the first game thats not the only case of the game being padded in the second half that whole lets spend a week in school was a right pain
  i say final fantasy tactics is at least suikoden ii tier
  its a pretty fun and goofy intermission between people getting murdered and betrayed
    i found it annoying and overlong it was a lot of work to give flik a jail bait stalker when hes still mourning the death of his ex
is there another 2d jrpg with comparable graphics suikoden 2 is the best looking game ive seen ever maybe
  bbbut neclord sidequest brings my and nashs eternal waifu to the series always and forever since the day i saw her
  btw this blew my mind
  why is this a problem though  because it becomes a pretty big asterix     suikoden 2 is a masterpiece    if youve played and enjoyed suikoden 1 some years ago so you feel nostalgia towards its returning characters
  fucking this its basically an snes game as far as graphics and control to boot ff6 plays better even
  how is that a negative statement 4th gen rpgs are way better than 5th gen ones on average because they have far shorter exposition scenes and less padding combined with shorter animations and less tedious battles
  literally every srpg and many arpgs
  agreed i enjoyed fucking beyond the beyond more than ff8
  you can take your pleb tastes somewhere else then
  being strung up about graphics on /vr/
best ending of any jrpg ever prove me wrong
    only the bad ending
  not at all it made the experience more enjoyable for sure but the game stands on its own and most people consider 2 far superior to 1
  i dont remember this fill me in
  nah it didnt learn from a single one of its predecessors mistakes at least s1 has the decency to be a like 15 hour game s2 drags on and on and the bad gameplay cant sustain the interest
i hate the s2s heros stupid baby face
    the bad ending being what exactly become ruler lose nanami kill jowy i only had one playthrough so dont know the different possibilities
    bad ending you either stay a leader or fuck off with nanami and jowy both dead    good ending nanami undermines her own death jowy lives and you all run around like bff fagots pretending nothing ever happened like a bunch of pussy whipped cunts having learned nothing and not grown at all
1 i loved but got bored of 2 after getting past the mountain place where the thot shows her tits
  at least s1 has the decency to be a like 15 hour game s2 drags on and on    s2 is like a 20 hour game you mongoloid
  ive yet to meet any person who claims to have done clives sidequest
  i always get this confused with seiken densetsu which is a masterpiece but when i copy the name since i dont know jap it leads me to some homosex boylove psshit game instead of the best gameboy rpg ever made i hate the people who made words faggots
  i did it as a kid on my second playthrough
  good any tips
  just play the game really fast i guess i remember there are a bunch of different gates like get to x within y hours and the most difficult one to get to is the town on the western side of the dunan lake cant remember the name i think you have to get there within 10 hours but after that its smooth sailing and very easy if you can get over that hurdle the rest will be very easy    theres a weird trick at the beginning of the game the first time you go to muse where if you go up to the matilda border and push on the gate itll just push backwards and you can walk past it if you fight a battle or two youll hit around level 40 and if you want to play the game really really fast this could be helpful
why did no one tell me balloon fight was so much fun    nes arcadestyle games thread
  people tend to flock to the big post mapper chip titles but from 1983 through the end of 1985 the famicom was really only capable of single screen arcade titles prior to 1986 the famicom/nes was basically just a more advanced colecovision
  its assumed anyone interested in classic gaming would at least play the classics
  just play joust instead
  most people just overlook the black box games as  pointed out    im a fan of stuff like this and blooper
  if youre a fan of the balloon trip mode in this game check out balloon kid on gb and the famicom reskin hello kitty world
  or joust since balloon fight is a really really blatant clone of that
  iirc iwata worked on the famicom port of joust so he just decided to make a different game using the same engine he coded to be honest balloon fight is not really a total clone of joust but yeah you can tell its based on it  heres my top score for balloon trip if anyone wanna try beating it its not that high anyway but took me many tries
  do you have reading comprehension problems i was making recommendations based specifically on balloon trip mode which is nothing like joust
  that was certainly my way of growing up with it my family didnt get an nes until 87  88 so our only black box title was super mario bros/duck hunt and a decade later clu clu land i got to play pro wrestling kung fu excitebike donkey kong classics and pinball all at friends houses but it was hard to really want to play those when megaman 3 ducktales castlevania and kid icarus all existed in their collections too
  i think even with 30 years of hindsight most early nes games just arent the best compared to other single screen games
great game  
  im glad they exist but cutting my teeth on super mario bros and zelda always made it hard to appreciate a good single screen arcade game the way others do they were massive sprawling quests where you went through world/s its hard to go heres 20 stages that loop on a progressively higher difficulty endlessly go for the score
  its easy for me to enjoy ms pacman or galaga pinball for nes not so much
  i can play pinball for hours such a comfy game
  for me its partially that i like fast and quick games these days its easier to pop something in play for 10 minutes and then stop and do something else just because as an adult i already dont have much time im also burnt out in general on longwinded adventure games that just feel padded out at times i love zelda 1 and 2 but the new ones arent for me for example id rather practice getting a good score at a favorite arcade game or on beating some small thing like alleyway for gb    im also a huge balloon fight fan though i used to be collecting for the game but i gave it up after iwata died something about the connection with him made it depressing for me to own that stuff still love the game though
balloon fight is the best joust clone i love joust so i actually like the balloon fight romhack called joust more its one of the few bootleg/repros i own
  balloon fight is the best joust clone  is there a worse joust clone than joust 2
  agreed as time goes on i find that im more and more into games that i can just pick up and play that doesnt mean singlescreen arcade games specifically but id much rather play something like the original castlevania over a zelda game    even when i was a kid activision anthology was one of my favorite game boy advance games
    hell yes i love gaming as a way to kill time and just get some happy endorphins running but i dont want to need to devote copious amounts of time to a game that requires it
  joust was better
  but not the nes port which was lousy
  ill give you that how did the 2600 manage to pull it off better then again it did space invaders better too weird
  balloon fight is better because of balloon trip mode and hip tanakas musical theme
  balloon kid does both those things better
    they hal cant remember got the physics really wrong i could have lived with the weird graphics had the physics worked right  the atari 800 and the 7800 had the best ports until the williams arcade collection was released
  here you go desu ive been practicing to try to break a million on and off for a while
  my phone auto corrected desu to desi uh oh
  dual jousting or flappy bird are worse    i have joust 2 arcade machine its not horrible but it gets way less play than joust the whole key is to only use the transform button to fall fast 2 is kind of neat for the level variety but it also pulls away from the action so its kind of a double edged sword    there was a joust 3 revenge of the lava troll that was a computer game someone made it was kind of neat but the levels scrolled vertically and that was very strange if youre a fan of balloon fight or joust type games its decent fun    im kind of into these type games i mentioned the romhack joust more but there is also a homebrew for atari 2600 called joust pong later renamed flapping that is kind of neat its basically pong with joust like flapping to move the paddles and features the pterodactyl
  nes space invaders was one of those special interest games that taito didnt bother putting much effort in because they knew it wouldnt be a huge seller and those who were going to buy it wouldnt be too qualityconscious
  cool but  is for balloon trip not balloon fight mode
  ffs i loved this game but had forgot the name of it thank you so much  will download it soon
  that is a balloon trip score it just on the demo screen because i died
why is classic sonic so awesome
  it all feels competent and aware of what its supposed to be unlike pretty much every sonic game that came after
  why is classic sonic so awesome  overall decent to great ost   great art direction   fun boss battles    gameplay didnt spolier___age___/spoiler all that great but its still fun
  please stop you wound me
  fpbp  it was a platformer that was too cool for school  and people did skip school to play sonic he is way past cool
2005  modern sonic sucks its just going fast without any sort of challenge literally press right to win  2018  le classic sonic sucks you cant go fast theyre always stopping you with enemies and obstacles xddd    what changed
  zoomer morons basically  classic sonic is easily the best the series will ever have there are pretty much no bad games on the megadrive  cd
  sonic 1  meh  sonic 2  9/10  sonic 3  boring slow as fuck    1 out of 3 aint bad i guess
   cd
  gameplay didnt spolier___age___/spoiler all that great but its still fun    whats wrong with the gameplay pretty much standard platformer same youll find in modern day indie shit did you want dialogue and cutscenes and meaningful choices or some shit
the mega drive/genesis featured a 16bit cpu chip that was used in arcade games at the time this is why many of its games felt frenetic and fast paced even with limited colour and sound capabilities it was the closest the console makers had gotten at that time to replicating the arcade experience at home     sonic is very much built in that tradition  timeless fun and fast experiences a classic in every right
  there is no way to have a game that feels fast and isnt stopandgo without removing challenge  sonic fans are so abused i feel bad for you guys also the group that says classic sonic sucks almost always recognizes the incompetence of 3d sonic as well
     i forgot to mention the microprocessor  it was the motorola 68000
  masonic
  classic sonic is objectively good
because it rewards excellence and forgives ignorance if youre awesome at it you can blast through and get all the rings the special stage quick boss kills etc that make you feel so badass but if youre still learning it doesnt crush you you lose your rings and try to get up to speed again its so good nintendo made yoshis island using a lot of the elements that made sk so great
  the speed of the game isnt really affected by the cpu unless you mean performance
why wasnt there a proper sonic game for the saturn
  thanks wikipedia
  lots of reasons yuji naka and the other people who worked on the genesis games were busy or maybe just were tired of it   there was sonic xtreme but that got canceled due to miscommunication i dont think it would have been very good anyway though
     it wouldnt be a good idea to hang your consoles flagship title on a 2d game back then     perhaps they should have though i hated early 3d games
  is this why people are saying marble zone sucks now
  uhh 2005 was a few years before unleashed came around with the hold x to win gameplay
  seemed like there were attempts but i assume they ran into performance issues making a cuttingedge 3d game with how you move as fast as you do in sonic notice how sluggish and lame sonics movement is in that 3d sonic jam hub level i think sega knew a whole game that worked like that just wasnt gonna cut it    ive said in a thread before though that sega shouldve just cut their losses and done a 25d sonic robo blast 2esque doom clone which wouldve been much easier on the hardware but i guess sonic team just didnt have the developer hindsight to even think of something like that at the time
  st didnt want make more 2d sonic after knuckles and wanted 3d but they didnt know what to do with 3d for years   when they finally got something saturn was over and the sonic adventure for the saturn was changed to dreamcast sonic jam 3ds world was a prototype of that and that sonics model was in sa dreamcast version in one scene for like a second in the tornado cutscene before chasing down egg carrier         now  that was always the least liked stage for me it was due to being linear except for act3 that had a secret path      there was rush which was a boost game
  this    theres no much else that needs to be said except that at the time of release the games were considered very technically impressive with excellent graphics and music even though the scrolling isnt perfect it was seen as incredible at the time
  wrong labyrinth zone was easily the most disliked sonic 1 stage nobody talked much about marble zone although at the time a lot of the screenshots from from marble zone
    marble zone is kino
  fun level design and simple responsive controls that allowed you to build momentum combined with a colorful distinctive art style and a catchy soundtrack
  at the time of release the games were considered very technically impressive with excellent graphics and music  i remember when my cousin brought the game over for the first time he hooked it up in the living room of my grandparents house and as soon as he turned it on the sega blew us all away including my grandparents who were watching and then he actually started the game and i just remember the colors were so vibrant and stunning i never saw anything like it before we couldnt believe how it looked and moved it looked like something from 30 years in the future thats impossible for any of the younger generation to really appreciate    the only other game that floored me like that was the first time i saw donkey kong country when a kid brought the booklet to school and we all kept asking are these actually screens of the game though no matter how many times he said yes it was hard to believe also the fmvs and prerendered backgrounds from ffvii and first person 3d sections from phantasy star were also stunning the first time seeing them but not to the level of sonic and dkc
  because it single handedly built sega into a household name and sega eventually went on to prove not too long after that how much of a hack company they were so sonic is this great amazing flukes on their part sonic was lightening in a bottle for them best platformers of the 16 bit era imo
  you cant go fast theyre always stopping you with enemies and obstacles xddd    it is sort of true though you can tell which levels are great and which arent levels like marble zone arent good since they go completely counter to the idea of the franchise the majority of sonic 2 3 and knuckles levels are good because for the most part the levels compliment the style of the games one issue that is a constant though that 3k did try to fix was the enemies stopping your momentum the instashield is a decent fix but it should have lasted a bit longer to be even more effective first games levels have aged the poorest
  people used to say that about the adventure series as well and they were not completely wrong radical highway is pretty much a boost sonic stage the seed was already there
  that too but not for those guys that found marble boring and slow      the platforming is pretty neat but the stage is mostly linear even labyrinth had sections with a 2nd path or the secret path to skip most of the act
  sonic jams hub section is less sluggish with an analogue controller but even then its nowhere near as fast as it should be  was pretty impressive at the time though
    i rarely ever post but i had to for this the first time playing a sth game back in the 90s with your familyoh god the feels nothing will ever supercede that feeling ive played damn near a thousand games since the original sonic but none managed to recreate that feeling of pure amazement that green hill zone brings to you gotta feel sorry for the millenials never having a chance to experience this
  it had a great team behind it that realized what worked and what didnt that team broke up after sk and it wasnt until christian whitehead came along when another good sonic game came out in 2017
        i think you need to learn the age range for millennials buddy its perfectly feasible for someone who is a millennial to have played sonic 1 at a young age back then im 31 so within the millennial range and played sonic when i was about 4 or 5
because 80s culture
  gotta feel sorry for the millenials never having a chance to experience this    i think you could leave out millenials and this would have made more sense millenials were born in 19811996 i was born in 80 38yo and relate more to millennials at least in pop culture such as games and cartoons than any other group i grew up on atari 2600 until i was 9 then moved to nes and other consoles when they came into existence i remember a kid i used to be friends with who was 4 years younger than me his mom used to babysit me and they grew up on nes    in other words a lot of millenials were a huge demographic for sonic games on genesis
why would i feel sorry for someone who can do the exact same thing today for free but doesnt bother to do it that doesnt make a lot of sense     some kind of their eyes wont let them enjoy old graphics retardation that kind of thinking is inherently disordered also sonic wasnt ever that good im sure minecraft can achieve the same feel spazzwad
  aware of what its supposed to be  yet it still has those long obnoxious maze levels
the great debate
  excuse me faggot
  both have fucking incredible music and visuals but i dont like how either of them play musha is my least favorite aleste game because of how fucking huge your character is and thunder force iv has horrible slowdown  personally my favorite md shmup is gleylancer not as good as these two audiovisually but the gameplay is fucking excellent
for me its musha  then  gradius 4  gaiden  raiden dx  star soldier  dragon blaze  sorcer striker
gleylancer
also the only flaw with gleylancer is the final phase of the last boss is basically impossible with anything other than the autoaim subweapon option
  wut the reverse option completely trivializes it and you can still complete the game by looping around the boss with the straight forward option
  right reverse as well i guess but i know the option i used throughout the rest of the game made it impossible
  just lol at ever playing a shmup on mega drive with all that slowdown due to its weak processor and the lack of mode 7
  he got jokes
  its not impossible to beat it with the forward option just really awkward
  this is by far the best shmup on genesis
  i used the directional pad movement so you have to move towards the enemy to aim towards the enemy when your actual goal is to quickly move away from the enemy i would love to see a video of someone beating it in that mode
  i actually really like both games here while they both excellent soundtracks and phenomenal graphics if i had to choose 1 it would be thunder force iv musha is good but its just way too easy tfiv is much more challenging the slowdown in tfiv can suck sometimes but i dont find it to be a big deal its null if you have an overclocked md or are playing the saturn version it is incredibly rare to see slowdown in a md game though as some others have said the actual shooting gameplay for these isnt anything new or amazing i think its fine but theyre still great to play if you like the genre to any capacity     i have yet to play gleylancer which i really want to but if i had to throw in some runner ups they would be gaiares fire shark truxton and maybe battle mania daijinjou
gleylancer is actually my favorite too but im a casual when it comes to shmups i thought the stages and bosses were consistently fun to play reverse control is my favorite however ive often heard more dedicated shmup fans tell me how bad it is so beware if youre a shmup veteran
  gonna grab these two games i feel weird jumping into a game when its a sequel but something tells me that matters not with this genre
  is this game actually good beyond the meme translations
  no its a mediocre punitive memorization shmup that sends you back several minutes to a previous checkpoint stripped of all power ups and speed ups
  shmupfans shit on the masterpiece ikaruga for no other reason than ign gave it a perfect score back in the day its better to ignore them
both games are good so not really a point in picking one is a more hardcore compile style vertical shmup and the other is a more traditional horizontal shmup if you have to pick one just go with what style you prefer and if you like both just play both    i like tf4 more because i played it first having played tf3 earlier on and having loved it and it didnt disappoint musha i played later when my skills were less shitty so i got to appreciate it as well but it didnt leave as much of a mark and the stages felt kind of long either way id play any of them at any time
i honestly like tf3 more than tf4 my other favorites are hellfire and verytex
mega drive / genesis has a cool selection of shmups but still none of them reaches the average by arcade standards the biggest issue with these console shmups is that theyre usually fine for beginners of the genre or people that seldom play it but if youre experienced with them they become a bit too easy and thus boring even on hardest settings autoscrolling games need to be challenging enough to stimulate the player hell even the ports are way easier check truxton  dont think this is dumb elitism its just what happens to people that play enough shmups and then try arcades its hard to go back to the relatively low stimulation of console ones my first clear was thunder force iii and that was a fun time but these days its arcade all the way      its probably toaplans second worst standard shmup vimana is definitely worse but not due to faggot reasons like   its just that its not that interesting in its design its toaplan trying to mimick irem instead of playing to their strengths with a bit of a bland result its still a decent game at least        nah only reason they think that way is explained earlier in my post isnt the ikaruga thing just a meme to trigger people
  meant to quote 
eliminate down is easily among the best
    musha mops the floor with thunderforce iv and i actually like thunderforce iv
thunder force iv by far musha isnt even the best 16bits aleste
  gleylancer not as good    yeah its one of those where random internet faggots trick you into thinking its actually good
    musha is the best 16bit shooter of them all now crawl back into the hole whence you came from
  the one on the right is a flight simulator
  love this game purely for the song from the first level good stuff
  more from him  
  could you explain the shmup experience from a veterans perspective do you guys play games over and over while advancing slightly further over repeated attempts as you figure out how to best approach stages or could you handle an easy shmup with pure reflexes ie what distinguishes an easy shmup from a hard one is it just the number of attempts before you 1cc it  are all veterans good at things like dodging speeding bullets on reaction and maneuvering through a minuscule opening in a hail of bullets or can people with slow reaction time and poor hand eye coordination eventually become shmup masters with enough practice and how
  what truly distinguishes a hard shmup from an easy shmup are the execution requirements memorizing a game is the first step you can do it like you say or via save states or practice modes to learn there are a bunch of shmups that can be cleared blind even arcades however thats not it some games are easy to beat once you know them others are hard even after you do these last ones are the ones experts tend to prefer and the entire appeal of shmups games that give you a fun challenge no matter what  thing is once youve cleared a bunch of moderate or hard shmups youve built general skills that are transferrable to the point easy shmups simply become too boring  reaction dodging is not the main point of the genre btw even if its still present particularly in bullet hells due to randomized patterns  an people with slow reaction time and poor hand eye coordination eventually become shmup masters with enough practice and how  yeah you learn the game and route it you simply think of what you have to do in advance and then do it this is the key aspect of shmups
i will give an example to thoe who may not understand what i mean by execution requirements  you know how in gradius games usually at the end theres a door that closes and if you dont go past it soon enough you get trapped and die well this might kll you the first time but once you know the trick its very easy to not fuck up again unless you have bad memory  however dodging some hard patterns can be hard to execute even if you know them by heart this applies even if said pattern is completely static example  
    that makes a lot of sense thanks for the explanation
  youre welcome and have fun with these should you play them
where the fuck is phelios and steel empire bio hazard battle was pretty cool too
  can people with slow reaction time and poor hand eye coordination eventually become shmup masters with enough practice    sure can and not just shmups you can get good at any game with enough smart practice even completely unpredictable multiplayer games hand eye coordination is something you develop through practice and reflexes are very variable if you anticipate whats coming then you will react to it easily applies very directly to shmups which are more memorization focused but even in fighting games knowing your opponents habits and knowing what they can or cannot do in certain situations makes you react quicker and better    there are also shmups and developers who deliberately focused on designing games around planning and memorization over execution and reaction such as irem and toaplan and takumi to an extent theres stuff for everyone really
  imo    thunder force iv  musha aleste  gaiares  lords of thunder  gleylancer  battle mania 2
  which arcade shmups are worth playing
  trial and error is a good thing
  ofcourse it is its how you learn
why arent you making a sega genesis game
because watermelon killed the industry
  this
because i dont have the knowledge or desire
didnt people find design documents for a bunch of sega consoles
  i dont know the first thing about making games i would love to though
  because im making shit more than a handful of hipster losers play
because tanglewood got made and noone talked about it
  because the sega genesis is the last console i care about if i were to make a genesis game it would be just for the sake of having one good game on the system
why do you even care
  this but the opposite id only make a game just to say the genesis finally has a bad game
  
  because it sucked
  because programming for retro consoles is fucking hard and not worth the effort
  nah you can shit out reto games in a game maker or baby friendly language pretty easy these days but agree its not worth the effort
i dont know assembly
  learn something more badass than javascript
  im neither a russian nor a brazilian
  i literally am working on a genesis game      you can use c and sgdk which is a fan made sdk 68k assembly is very easy and a lot of fun though
because i dont like the megadrive
because i cant into math
thats funny ive been thinking about doing a simple metroidvania the last couple days since i was following along the big evil blog a while back somewhat ok i need some ideas that arent vampire hunters or space marines though
  no big deal neither can the 68k     it can only handle integers and add/sub/mul/div
  planet has no gravitational pull  either the planet or the capsule is retardedly massive  either way the moon near the planet is far too close to the planet  keep trying anon
  either the planet is tiny or the capsule is retardedly massive
   why arent you making a sega genesis game  im making a pc engine game and i previously did a nes one close enough
making games for modern computers where i can just load a png and display it on the screen rotate it whatever the fuck is still a lot of work doing it in assembly and the tooling and learning the hardware is just a real pain in the dick im not interested / too busy anyway
  is still a lot of work  wew lad
  because genesis a shit
how much skill do i need to make a game and pixel art like bloodstained curse of the moon or basically any retro game without limitations super cyborg maldita castilla oniken all of those
  it can only handle integers and add/sub/mul/div  really it has division thats pretty advanced
  the cool thing about these consoles though is that the graphics hardware is like a game engine in that the hardware itself provides background layers sprites and the manipulation of aforesaid
  kids lol
  no its not close enough sega genesis or bust
  explain this game
ive tried so many times to get into building a game i get so far and lose my motivation even with user friendly guis and premade assets im like pffffffffffffffff naah lol
why not make a 32x game    ps do you need a dev kit to make new games for older consoles or are their workarounds
  never played shadowrun on genesis i see
  more people own a genesis or repo
    looks like asteroids
    
      this
  gamemaker can be decent when making arcadelike games properly which ive done with a version of polybius i stress the word properly like hell and for obvious reasons however when this is achieved you may get something like what some guys over in spain did they used adobe flash to make a game called nave and built a cabinet for it with even a 19 crt arcade monitor and made it look kickass definitely wouldnt use these tools to make console games obviously gotta use the real thing
  it isnt math its keeping track of register maps
    have you ever played escape velocity     its gonna have trading combat as pictured upgradeable ships missions etc    you can already land on planets and fly to other systems but the planet graphics are missing so nothing happens when you land
  there are compilers and assemblers for most consoles and you can target emulators though not all of them are perfect so your game might behave differently on real hardware      it has division but its quite slow really a lot of sega fanboys play up the speed of the 68k in the genesis but for 8/16 bit ops its around the same speed as the snes 65816 its only when you start using a bunch of 32bit instructions that the 68k has an advantage and also when compared to slower rom that the snes had to deal with
   this  isnt reddit    very nice start anon sgdk is pretty cool but i havent done much with it except playback my own music and simple routines i hate c give me m68k assembler any day but the sgdk has some routines in it i have no chance in hell of coding myself
  with kits like sgdk a lot of stuff is in the package for converting graphics handling/playing audio etc you dont really need to do much just include the files in your sources and make does all the rest doing it all in assembler and with such a dire lack of any decent graphics tools map editors music editors/compilers for sega consoles youll end up working on your megadrive program for a long time
  theres actually a good number of tools for working with the genesis that interface fine with assembler sound engines graphics tools decompressors even whole open source games you can learn from still more work than with sgdk but its definitely possible for a single person
  reminds me of star control
  someone on /agdg/ told me that
  actually a good number of tools  sound engines graphics tools decompressors  links with source code thanks ive seen plenty of genesis music systems over the years and theyre all closed source and come with no way to playback on the genesis shirus genesis tracker was the only one i can remember that actually had source code to use on the genesis side most music solutions ive seen use the trackers custom formats like sgdk or use that incredibly shittier format called vgm whoever invented vgm seriously needs to be gassed i cannot recall seeing a tile  map editor for genesis that wasnt from the 1990s or early 2000s and not a broken pile of fucking shit    tldr  links with source code thanks
        has a couple compressors a tiling tool converts bitmap graphics to tiles various music conversion tools      has a bunch of code you can use mit licensed sound engines compression and decompression tools more tiling tools etc    another sound engine      source code to read  sik has 4 games and an operating system you can read the source code for on github                     there are more games you can find if you look around on the spritesmind forum    also i didnt mean tile or map editors i agree that there arent any good ones  i just use gimp for now
i want to create a game boy game
  theres a ton of resources for that too  
  implying javascript is badass to begin with
  where is my fucking telegenesis modem sega
i bought pier solar which comes on a 64 yes 64 megabyte genesis cart but i bought the dreamcast version for cd audio / better music
    im gonna start making some sweet fart modulation synth tunes for the genny
check this out           its being made by mike philips who was involved in the development of homefront
  because i cant code for shit
  tell me how i have 0 knowledge in programming and would like to make one like ninja gaiden/shinobi
  tell me how  lrn2 thats really all there is to it
  because there are no good mega drive emulators with debugging features as comprehensive as on emus like vba
  its inspired by the game escape velocity and is supposed to play like that that means no gravity etc    ill probably move the moon further out but this was just a test star system i threw together in a few minutes
  exodus is pretty damn comprehensive  what else do you need
  there is one that ive had my eye on for a while called xeno crisis it looks like a mix between aliens and smash tv  the guy making the music seems pretty damn cool and he even reworks a lot of genesis songs to sound fuller and less farty   heres the theme for the first level of the game   and heres a trailer for it  i just hope it doesnt end up like paprium in that it doesnt happen at all
  genesis or bust  ugly ass master palette and color limitations that are only redeemed by the extra background layer  no widespread adoption of cdrom addon  nigga prease
  xeno crisis  creates jill valentine lookalike space marine for the game instead of a regina lookalike  reeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  it didnt believe you so i looked it up yep it has the divs and divu opcodes for signed and unsigned division cool stuff i suppose they probably used lookup tables most of the time instead of those instructions though    i just played through rocket knight adventures it seems like the megadrive has some sort of advantage speed wise because a i rarely see slowdown and b i seem to see a lot of complex enemy ai that rapidly changes states and has more complex states what i mean is there will be a boss that has a fairly complex pattern including its animation and then it will instantly change into a different pattern that is also complex maybe it is the rom speed that allows this
  maybe thats too on the nose i dont know
  im hyped
  he probably wants something that has the features hes used to on the other emulators he uses he probably also wants those features to work debugging is no fun when only some of the features work some of the time im sure exodus will be fine when its finished but until now its pretty half baked certainly compared to the stuff available for other systems
  i havent used it in a while but i thought it was pretty solid
  you cant export game maker games to sega genesis
  you can program and design games like that with pseudocode engines like construct means you dont need to actually know a real programming language    you still gotta be able to draw to do pixel art its actually kinda harder in some ways because its simpler assuming you mean 816 bit style pixel art    those games all probably took at least a thousand hours to complete the tools and knowledge are super accessible now but it still takes time
    i know one of the guys working on this dont worry its in good hands its gonna be great
i checked all the threads and there doesnt seem to be a thread suited to what i want to talk about  id like to buy a used ps2 because i never had one as a kid and because it handles ps1 games as well i dreamt of having a ps1 even more than the ps2 actually  anyway what should i look out for im not interested in modded consoles because games are dirt cheap anyway are there any ways of quickly checking if a console is in good condition what are the most common problems with used ps2s are there wireless controllers for it and if there are are they any good
i found an scph90000 at a value village this week for 40 cad i did not buy it because those arent moddable last i checked    unless youre in ottawa then i dont know if this helps but know theres hope for finding a thrift unit op
  fmcb
  even then 40 for a ps2 at vv is way too much thats what youd pay at a game store so why pay that at a thrift store
  just get a ps1 they are literally dirt fucking cheap and are less of a headache to maintain than the ps2
  i dont know if thats what i would have paid at microplay but then it would have at least come with accessories
  im not interested in modded consoles because games are dirt cheap anyway  thats not entirely true when talking about ps1 games  are there wireless controllers for it and if there are are they any good  there are third party controllers that are wireless but ive never used one in my life and ive never seen anyone who ever used one so i couldnt tell you if they are actually any good  what should i look out for  if you are planning on playing on a crt through component or rgb then get a ps2 if thats not available and you are going to play on an hdtv then just get a ps3 it already has wireless controllers and all ps3 models are compatible with ps1 discs while only the fats are compatible with ps2 discs however if your dream is playing ps1 that wont be an issue for you
  any fat model adult owned tested and working no major signs of damage get a logitech wireless controller for ps2 the black and blue one you can get a bundle with all the hookups and a controller for around 50 to 60 bucks on ebay games are dirt cheap and combined with the ps1 you have a library of like 5000 games a fantastic investment for anyone who likes games have fun
  i had an officially licensed wireless ps2 controller called the katana apparently    i hated it tried playing god hand with mine the thumbsticks would slip all over the place the buttons felt chunky i was a youngn but even i noticed the difference in input timing
op i was just like you a year ago    after a bit of research i settled for an older fat ps2 because it allowed me to shove a hdd in it and easily soft mod it  god got mine for 20 and it came with a controller memory card and a couple of games i didnt want to get but the guy offered them for free after i already paid    i had however difficulty finding an official network adapter    i found one for 25 together with a compatible hdd so i got it    i know you said youre not interested in modding it but its worth considering for those few rate and expensive games you might want to play    best of luck to you anon
  this could have been me too except i looked over this list here        and when i discovered that every game i wanted to play was perfectly playable on my modded ps3 slim i lost interest in ever getting my wouldbe third ps2
  ill be honest i didnt bother looking over the compatibility list  i got mine mainly to play some games i wanted to play for a long time like silent hill god of war and resident evil    i have a ps3 too but last i checked it was umoddable i dont know if things changed ill check later
   have a ps3 too but last i checked it was umoddable  its been broken open for several years now even the ps4 has been hacked
  ill have to check and see if my model is compatible last i checked it wasnt compatible to whatever mods are available or due to firmware
  not retro  not retro  not retro
  it is if you use it to play ps1 games like i do
  anyway what should i look out for  the slim is great since its so small quiet and stays cool however there are a few compromises you make when you get one over an original style model besides modding you cant use the same type of multitap that a fat uses and you cant use the system link feature which is pretty neat for some games but thats ps2 only     are there any ways of quickly checking if a console is in good condition  test some games the most likely part to break on a ps2 is the laser so itll be obvious when it doesnt read discs or reads them very slowly try out a number of games since some games work better on a worse laser than others do try out a couple dvds too if you really want to    what are the most common problems with used ps2s  the laser as i said i also have one with a broken controller port plug guide though the port works fine with out it otherwise most people have never cleaned their ps2s so itll probably be dirty as hell on the inside     are there wireless controllers for it and if there are are they any good  yes i use the logitech controller a lot the shape is kind of awkward but it works well i also use the pelican/gamestop wireless models but they leave a lot to be desired with their plastic guided analog sticks that wear down so much they feel as loose as hell the shape of the body is godly though what with its tiered shoulder buttons now i tend to stick with controller wire extension cords so i can use whatever controller i want at a distance
  op anon listen to this anon you can now get the network adapters on ebay that are just hard drive adapters that take sata connections they are cheap like 15 or so its honestly worth it to buy a pre modded fat ps2 they are very cheap    also dont discount a modded ps1 you will have to burn games but they work very well also good for imports
  i got a 900000 8d model and it is indeed moddable they wont get the modded bios menu where you manually select between the apps but if you hold triangle while booting the console you will get straight into the ulaunch and then you can manually start any app that you want or assign custom apps to custom gamepad keybinds for quick booting    very common myth
  besides modding you cant use the same type of multitap that a fat uses    this is true however you can fix it there is a video on youtube about it basically you just unscrew the male jacks on the multitap push the plastic tip further outside so that it can reach the male jack in the console and just put some super glue so that it doesnt go back anymore
  iirc anything below 9xxxxx will be able to run free mcboot to play burned games however a lot of people prefer the older fat models because you can use the netplay thing and a harddrive to play games that way without needing to burn them to cds/dvds
  i was against buying the cheap adapters because i didnt know how good they work    as for the modded ps1 i have one as well  i personally ran into a lot of problems with it i had to restart the console a lot untill it read my burned discs but after that it was smooth sailing  i managed to somewhat fix it by adjusting the laser resistance but it still needs a bit of time untill it reads them  then again maybe i should buy a new laser altogether
  dont get a slim they are garbage if you get a slim do this      if you get a fat do this  
  whats wrong with the slim  t slim owner
  the logitec ps2 controllers are totally great no sync issues but the initial sync is a pain but they are hard to find
  im using a slim with a raspberry hooked to the ethernet port so i can run iso from its smb share using opl  pretty straightforward to configure and works perfectly without slowdowns you can download game art with opl manager its silent af loading seems faster than reading from disk at least i dont find crash wrath of cortex loading times annoying as someone says didnt measure it but sure its under 10 sec  only jak and daxter didnt work outofbox but you just need to activate compatibility mode like described in ps2home forum  my experience is 10/10 for now better than using original discs my laser is loud and probably scratching them i sure treat them well
  i have to replace the laser 7 times in the last 10 years soldering up a modbo 60 was a bitch no ethernet support so i have to relay on disk until the raspi 3 solution came up even then using a fat  ethernet to sd adapter is the fastest way to play games
the problem with modded ps2 is that some burned games wont run    i say this because i have a slim ps2 but some burned games dont run such as parappa the rapper 2 and halflife if somebody knows any other way to run these games dont tell me the usb way pls please tell me ill be very grateful
  look up opl with smb
  where i live theres contant tides with used ps2 prices one month you can get one for 25 and a couple of months later theyre 100 demand rises and falls for them drastically and constantly here      make sure it works thats the obvious never underestimate the ability of some asshole to sell you a busted console
  got a ps2 from ebay for 7 bought a new laser for 12 and had a perfectly functioning unit
i have my original ps2 fat to nly issue is a crack on the corner of the console it got during a move but noticed its having a hard time reading purple ps2 disks is this a sign of laser failure
  they are actually moddable  mine came with a infinity matrix chip preinstalled and i didnt even know it did when i bought it
6th generation consoles arent /vr/ yet wait until 2020
  ps2s play ps1 games
  based aussie
  thanks for the help anon
  go away hall monitor
  very common myth  that addon obviously meant softmoddable aka fmcb which the vast majority of 90000series ps2 cant do  thus its shit and should be avoided
  these are great and my old one still works used controllers are available but i would be hesitant to buy one while my controller is still technically functional the rubber pad under the x button has lost its springiness the x button sticks ever so slightly and no amount of cleaning or lubing helps the only measure that can be taken is to swap the rubber pad under the button with one of the lesser used buttons but this isnt a great solution
  if i cant talk about the gba you cant talk about the ps2
can i boot ps games from an hdd or should i just emulate ps on my computer/another console
    the latter you cant do a whole lot ps on a ps2 in general just load backup discs if its hardmodded
  yes its hardmodded thats why i can boot games from hdd but honestly i dont even know if the laser works anymore will just play them on the ps3 or whatever then
  you cant boot ps1 games from a ps2 hdd unless you do some janky emulation stuff though pops you can still do the swap trick though
this is not retro this is a 6th generation console out of 8 generations
  it plays fifth generation video games you dumb fuck
  ps3 plays ps1 games and its retro you dummy
  great logic so my xbone is retro
  buy a fat ps2 that has a network/hdd adapter and call it a day you can install a hard drive mcfreebot and have all the games on both libraries at your disposal total cost is like 50 including system controllers and memory card
i guess ill piggyback on this thread since a faggot nigger mod deleted my thread asking about a ds3 controller to play retro games    i would like a wired ds3 official i hate 3rd party design controller to emulate ps1 games on my computer but i cant find a wired one on amazon at all so how does the bluetooth stuff work if i buy a wireless ds9 does it come with a thing that i plug into a usb port on my computer im running mid range early 2017 gaming pc with w10 can anyone give info
  get a mini usb cable now you have a wired controller
  i thought they dont transmit real time information though a usb cable transfer stuff from my computer to my phone but i cant plug in a usb cord to a ds3 and play a game
  ps2 isnt retro fuck off newfag
  yes it is
  not by the definition of this board    this board is for the discussion of classic or retro games retro gaming means consoles computer games arcade games including pinball and any other forms of video games on platforms launched in 1999 and earlier with the release of the 8th generation of consoles the sega dreamcast will now be considered retro though the remainder of the sixth generation xbox ps2 gamecube will not
      you see the part where it says ps2 is not considered retro you dumb faggot
  2000 is still retro you fucking cuck it is the cut off you retarded faggot cuck hillary supporter
  if you want help on getting it to play those retro games then yeah tell us about your xbone shit for brains
  with the release of the 8th generation of consoles the sega dreamcast will now be considered retro though the remainder of the sixth generation xbox ps2 gamecube will not    mods
  go back to /pol/ disparaging remarks against homosexuals cucks and hillary are not advertiser friendly nor are they welcome on 4channel
  discussing emulation of ps is allowed thats what this thread is about
  slims are good but i would avoid the two tone model those were the last run and sony started cheaping out with them an you can not fmcb them also slims can scratch discs if the ribbon cable comes up it was glued down but most of them have popped up now something to check if you score a slim
  sure you can get away with playing playstation games on ps2 but keep in mind that it is pretty soulless compared to the original grey console if you want to recreate the true retro vibe that us hardcore gamers experienced in the 90s then stick to the original hardware emulation is like masturbation compared to sex with a real lady
  youre the guy that wears an ar15 around the city and shouts at cops about your rights  obviously using ps1 emulation is a transparent excuse to talk about ps2s no one is buying your shit newfag
  powerful
  ive been here since before you were born newfaggot
  fuck off bootlicker  we talk emulation all the time and nobody i would hope is using a 90s pc and wii threads are never taken down
  why not get a ds4
  fuck you fag
  mcfreebot  got a kek from me anon
the fat ones will last you much longer and youll probably find them for similar prices to the slim theyre all solid though so if you happen upon a great deal for a slim then youre fine damage should all be very obvious just make sure the dvd drive still works thats the most common point of failure have fun with your ps1 games anon
  the fat ones will last you much longer   ive never seen a defective slimline ps2 in my life the fat one on the other hand
i thought ps2 wasnt considered retro on this board
  im learning real fast that mods only delete whatever they feel like regardless of rules the rules are more of a suggestion to them  in fact theyll probably delete this very post and then ban my ass afterwards for calling them out on it you just watch
        you people are ruining any chance for this board to become less of the repetitive nonsense it became 4 years ago same threads daily in and out 6th gen can help that    only 4channel pretends 6th gen as a whole isnt retro even reddit and 9fag are ahead of us here shit i bet that resetera is too
call me old school but i only play regular release games on disc never done anything with backups or bootlegs or hd loaders got access to a free mcboot memory card but havent really fucked around with it in any way where to start for ps1 games only of course
  if you are going to use an hdloader for ps1 games you may as well just use an emulator because hd loaders use an emulator to play ps1 games  if you want real hardware performance get psio
i dont really feel like this thread is retro   if it is then i dont see why i cant make a thread about the newest video cards under the guise that i want to emulate using mame with them
  lol
  because old cards are what you want that support 15khz
  moderation is all over the place  for reference the day this thread was deleted there was a thread about the gba hamtaro game up for days later
  no i prefer to use lcds for emulation so i might make a thread about nvidia gtx 1080 tis because i want to play mario with one d
posting in this thread because i dont see another    i just set up pcsx2 and i have a 1070/i5 6600k can anyone suggest any good games that are expensive/rare ie rule of rose    games i would never have a chance to play otherwise or legit    favorite ps2 games are mgs3 nba street ffx
  go on ebay and sort by highest price
    yeah but i want to know which of those are worth playing heres a few i found that had interesting cover art    haunting ground500  kuan 429    the other ones i knew or looked dumb
  thats what metaljesus is for
    youre talking about ps2 games which arent retro    mods    sheesh the mods on reddit are much more timely and attentive
  its my understanding you cant load ps1 isos from the hdd or it has bad compatibility    id love to be proven wrong tho
  theyre all solid  except for 50000series killing its laser
  sheesh the mods on reddit are much more timely and attentive  sounds like you know where to go back to then
  god hand
    this lame attempt at proving this thread isnt retro  get a load of this baby obsessed
  thats odd i have a modded ps2 and the only burned games that have refused to run are cd games and bad dumps    try downloading the games from somewhere else or just switch to opl like the other anon suggested best option imo
      if the highlighted bit on your scph9xxxx says 8a or 8b softmodding fmcb works 8c is hit or miss and depends on your bios
  ywn be able to have comfy ps2 threads on /vr/ without also having to allow halo
  you realize halo is now on par with super mario for nostalgia
  im ready for whatever awaits me in the afterlife
    parappa the rapper 2 straightup doesnt work burned my console used to comically eject it shortly after boot as if calling me a dirty pirate switch to opl and use either a hard drive or smb since its a rhythm game i reccomend a hard drive since its lagless compatibility is much better in general
pulled my childhood ps2 out of storage to see if my crt was the problem because my ps1 was putting horrible green lines all over the screen checked the bottom and its a 30003r model its kind of janky though and takes ages to read the disk what are my options
  i just fixed my mates 30003 yesterday    open it up take the top off the optical drive 4 small screws and clean the laser lens large screw gear and metal rails
  since its a rhythm game i reccomend a hard drive since its lagless  i didnt notice any lag with smb seems better than using the original disc
  i love my fat for hd loading but it is most certainly not more reliable than a slim
  its probably been said already but this thread is long already on ebay there are a lot of ps2s with new lenses bundled with an hdmi adapter and a mcboot memory card for burned games for a nice price i know you arent looking for mods the mcboot memory cards boots burned games without any modding great for games like rule of rose kuon or haunting ground
  he mcboot memory cards boots burned games without any modding  no theyre not that just works with esr    but were way offtopic now anyway
ps2 is not retro
  keep screaming it until 6th gen is allowed around here then keep screaming it more
  same here but interested in getting a scph5001 fat for softmodding is there anywhere in the uk where i could get a decent working one for as cheap as 30 to 40 quids ebay is the last resort honestly fuck the prices over there desu  bonus points for somewhere that could sell the og network adapter as well
  scph5001 is a us ps1 sure thats what you want    in any case try cex and cash converters unless you want cib all theirs are under 40 docs
what do you guys think of maximo is it a good 3d adaptation of ghost n goblins
    the first one is really good the second not so much
  not  retro

i liked deus ex too op
is a hacked snes mini any better than a rp3 for emulation  i heard the internal snes emulator has less input lag but outside of that i assume retroarch performs about the same as it does in an rp3
  just use a pi or pc
going to piggyback op here how well does a steam link work for emulation
  already have a pi though was just wondering if it was worth it to make the jump to this
  its easier to set up controllers are pretty good you cant fit everything on it at once but its decent id say its about the same level as a pi but better controllers and its case looks good
  ive got a rp3 in a retroflag superpi case with a snes classic themed retropie image        also the cartridge slot on the case actually pops up when you press eject revealing a compartment for your other microsd cards pretty neat
  once youve modded it can you reverse it sort of to factory settings  ive thought about adding more roms to it but theres something about owning the first official release of star fox 2 that has been putting me off tampering with it
  the hakchi utility saves the consoles base state as a file that you can use to flash it back to factory settings if you so choose
    it has nowhere near the power of a pi3 or 3b so no     its braindead simple and the onboard storage has more than enough space to run every game worth a shit that doesnt have issues with the internal emulator i hit about 130 games on mine before i was scraping the bottom of the barrel
  i had a hacked snes with around 1500 games sent it back for a pie 3bthe pie is much betterhas all of that plus ps1 games
  snes mini does ps1
dont listen to the pi faggots canoe is better because it doesnt have a halfsecond of latency
  i like blueberrie pis they are good
  owning the first official release of star fox 2  imagine being this much of a fucking autist  nintendo just downloaded the same fucking rom that i did 15 years ago fuck you
    thanks for the help lads sounds great
  its a glorified extension cable for hooking up your pc to a tv if for some reason you need a long ass cord so the emulation capabilities will depend on your pc
  he doesnt know
  this meme again  how did you download a rom when you were 3 years old
  good news for me because i can emulate most everything
  my dad cock vored a computer faggot
  mine didnt have them on it
  knocked off
  halfsecond of latency  bullshit prove it or fuck off
not really i dont see why maybe by a small bit however nintendo has no magical way to avoid standard emulation latency
  im pretty sure youre a shill but i do own a retroflag case and they are pretty nice
  im pretty sure youre a shill  how so  i was thinking about their controllers but if they are using shills its a nono
  no shill just enthusing about a product i think is pretty cool especially if you want the snes classic look im pretty sure they must have done a 3d scan of the real case
im sure i remember someone making a music album on the gameboy cameras dj minigame also known as trippyh but i just cant seem find it on google    anybody got any examples of cool music made on this and does anybody remember what artist made a full album using it
  best i got off the top of my head is the album cover for silver and gold by neil young

video games can never be art
  cant argue with the truth
  games  art  also sage
  if you want to try making your video game art feel free to manipulate the graphics and music to your liking just dont start imposing unakippable cutscenes on me
  ebert is dead for 5 years  morons still mad about his halfhearted comment made 25 years ago  daily reminder he literally forgot about the whole thing before 90s even ended but you are still working yourselves over it
i know roger film on the other hand can be and often is
  25 years ago  he said it in 2010
  he was right youre playing with toys thats fine i guess but its certainly not art
the gameplay is the art of videogames
  no anon he said that in the tail end of the 90s early 98 to be more precise  and then someone dig that out in the end of 09 starting the whole games will never be art   meme featuring ebert who was completely confused when people suddenly started asking him about the issue because he had no idea what they are even referring to
whats with all these shitty zero substance /v/ threads
  what toy had your favorite soundtrack
  hes right and honestly dont see the reason why so many people get butthurt over this
  games are a more important part of the human experience than art  at its best art is a profound expression of ideas or feelings meanwhile games are practice for real life which are passed down through generations hence why adults play them as well as children
  probably the teletubby i had as a kid youd push the stomach and it talked
  its the weekend the kiddies are bored and wanting their yous
  in 2010 he quite literally was unable to speak throat cancer which was in the same time killing him so he had bigger concerns than something completely out of his field      not him but are you for real  video games have soundtrack  which means music  and music is considered art  thus video games are art because one of their ingredients is art in general  its like a logic stream of a 9 yo and you need to be at least twice of that to even post here
  jokes on you toys are art too you stupid fuck
  videogames include art  as a complete package videogames supercede art
    you should see how bad it is today with /tg/ actual users either left to play are playing or are coming home after game so the entire board is taken over by bored robots and poltards
  in 2010 he quite literally was unable to speak  okay yes he didnt literally say it he wrote it in his blog
    epic falseflagging bro i totally believe youre a gamer and not some knob saying that stupidest possible things
  not sure if this is bait desperation or stupidity  so i guess all three
  tits even nice ones are not an argument
  there had to have been art snobs back in the 20s saying the exact same thing about film that it wasnt art and never will be
  no you just are brainwashed by artfags and have no real life experience if you did youd know that even though both games and art are important to civilization games are usually more important than art
  film that it wasnt art and never will be  and then american film industry did its very best to prove them right    fortunately there are other countries and places on this planet
  art is a primarily visual medium and in order to elicit a certain emotion from the player control must be taken away in at least some form to focus on a specific scene thing or event this is the antithesis of what video games should be
  
  social games with real people might be all that but videogames by yourself are definitely not
art is supposed to make you feel something video games make you feel nothing
  we can argue between castlevania iv and rondo of blood for the 800th time if you prefer
  art is a primarily visual medium
  why arent gamers content to play their games and simply enjoy themselves they have my blessing not that they care do they require validation in defending their gaming against parents spouses children partners coworkers or other critics do they want to be able to look up from the screen and explain im studying a great form of art then let them say it if it makes them happy
what was his problem
his
  did giygas not have a gender 
    btfo
mommy issues
  we dont know giygass gender pronouns
on the first game it was mommy issues in mother 2 hes basically desperate for love of any kind same as porky
  in mother 2 hes basically desperate for love of any kind same as porky  no basically he had learned at some point from the apple of enlightenment that ness was destined to defeat him and basically went crazy trying to prevent his supposed destined defeat
ネスさんネスさんネスさんネスさん  チガウチガウチガウ
  giygas is more of a concept than a person so it would probably be the correct pronoun
  giygas intimidation  giygas is wounded  giygas intro  giygas stirs  giygas disintegrates  giygas is fatally wounded  giygas lair
  his great nephew midfucked him so hard he left then some apple told him some clone of his nephew was gonna kill him so he want haywire and destroyed his body
          fat kid turned his brain machine off
  if counting everything else like pokeys punk theme or the prayer segments which isnt connected to the actual fight with giygas  giygas intimidation  pokey means business  giygas is wounded  giygas intro  giygas intro  eight melodies  giygas stirs  giygas disintegrates  prayer for safety  giygas is fatally wounded  giygas lair
he needed to pray the gay away
  that it hurts and that you keep insisting on beating on him regardless
  he didnt like faggots like yourself
  teddys singing to giegue made his mind deteriorated so quickly that pokey created a machine that looks like a cervix  teddy for this reason created a monster that not even he knew about up until his retirement from the ellay live house
how would you rank the retro brosnan 007 games /vr/
  goldeneye  twine  tomorrow never dies
1 the world is not enough  2 goldeneye without the nintendo bonus  3 tomorrow never dies
  world  goldeneye  tomorrow    world is not enough is a better fps than goldeneye but goldeneye was what everybody grew up playing and i think by the time world came out people were already moving on to the next gen and missed out on it
goldeneye  twine  tomorrow never dies    ignore anyone who says differently theyre just contrairian
    tryhard contrarian faggots
    twine has better multi than ge though
    goldeneye  the world is not enough  tomorrow never dies    all 3 are worth a playthrough
  why is his face like that on the lefthand box
  quite poorly none of them are any good
  do the people who ask this not ever wonder why theres a gun barrel floating in front of his cheek
  the ranking is obvious but despite tomorrow never dies being the weakest of the three i still like it a lot and love that first mission where you get to pilot the jet

  he knows what it is he is just prancing around in the most gay way possible acting the fool
  was there a die another day game
twine on ps1 is a very comfy shooter underrated
  
  bond burgering your sister  playing those shitty games
  you realize thats a common misconception right thats his fingers not part of his mouth      what a boss
i loved goldeneye back in the day but for some reason never even tried the other brosnan games
1 goldeneye  2 world  3 tomorrow    anyone played this mod yet what bond game would you like to see modded for the n64    i think die another day would be quite good
  its alright fairly standard romhacklevel fare though it doesnt live up to the name of goldeneye but with the levels being goldfinger i feel like it did one mortal sin for romhacks and thats that it made the levels too huge and the puzzles too hard big studios can get away with that sometimes turok hexen but romhacks should be more flashy to hold attention
  twine on ps1 is a different game so we can consider 4 games here
  no 007 racing
  007 racing  no thanks
  fucking disgusting
  i love the idea but it only has one good level and it wasnt even taken from the movie
perfect dark  goldeneye  
    i enjoy this game but it would be at the bottom of the list
  goldeneye  twine n64  twine ps1  tnd  007 racing    power gap    goldfinger 64
  racing is a pretty neat little game i had fun in multiplayer as a kid
  yeah most people realize right away that its a joke and honestly its not that common i never knew anyone in person who was tricked by the illusion
like the first ewj game a lot  dislike the sequel   anyone feels the same  i just cant get behind all those gimmicky levels
yeah the sequel had too many gimmick levels but on the flipside the difficulty was a lot more reasonable i can beat the sequel in one sitting no problem but the original eh
  but on the flipside the difficulty was a lot more reasonable    i still dont know how to deal with pupa pedro    overall ewj2 is pretty shit  it has two real soundtrack song and the rest of the soundtrack is just public domain garbage i wont even mention gameplay because there is hardly any  a couple of real platforming levels at the beginning and at the end of the game rest is minigame galore
  as a kid i played the first one over my neighbors house a lot and loved it but i got the second one myself and ended up playing it more i always liked the more cartoony vibe the second one had over the first looking back the only gimmick level i absolutely cant stand is flyin king its just way too easy to fuck up and have to do it over and over i dont think i ever legitimately beat it as a kid    people bitch about puppy love but i found it to be more hectic and fun and far less frustrating than for petes sake in the first game i think a lot of people hate puppy love because they didnt read the instruction manual and realize you can dive or change the direction that jim is facing which is actually really crucial i recall getting really good at even the later levels of puppy love as a kid    on my most recent playthrough i was expecting the cow abduction level to be a pain in the ass but i actually found it to be more fun than i remember the cows with fuses were kind of exhilarating    you can really tell the folks at shiny were worried that the sequel would be criticized for just being more of the same or that the levels were possibly too repetitive so while they may have not placed enough confidence in their own run n gun mechanic i think that ultimately it just helps the second game feel like something completely different which is far preferable to it just being the first game with a different coat of paint
  the only gimmick level i absolutely cant stand is flyin king its just way too easy to fuck up and have to do it over and over i dont think i ever legitimately beat it as a kid  this ones easy you just clear out the enemies then backtrack for the air balloon the enemies do not respawn
  based earthworm jim 2 japanese cover poster
  really it isnt like ewj had amazingly robust run n gun controls and gameplay in the first place the gimmicks honestly helped the game in this aspect
  im still confused for what all those different guns were supposed to be for there are like only three or four actual platformer levels in the entire game where you could use them theyre not particularly widely available your pick ups dont get saved unless you start from the very beginning of the game and there arent really any enemies that need more than your plasmagun and whip
  iirc the original pc release even had a bug where youd turn invincible if you blew up the balloon right at the start
theyre both really good games that would benefit from cutting at least half of andys asteroids and puppy love  otherwise i think theyre some of the better games from that generation
  do what i do when i replay them use the level skip cheat
  andy asteroid lasted like a minute or what and if you fail you just need to beat a bonus boss    meanwhile juggling puppies takes forever you do nothing but bump puppies into the safety for several mintues and failure is not an option at all  theyre not really comparable andy asteroid is just a fluff minigame to make player feel like youre speeding to another planet to conquer another level not something maliciously put into game for a sole purpose of screeching the game pace to a halt so you have to bounce fucking puppies
played both back in the day loved both equally
  puppy love was easy i was a kid when i played it and it was no biggie    i did find it pretty fucked up how the puppies sorta exploded when they hit the ground
the first one has its share of bullshit gimmicks though i hate all those race levels i wish this game was just an action platformer
  its pretty fucking mean on hard mode sometimes pete will miss the throw and the bomb will bounce back to you
  you even had those firework rockets conveniently placed to go the beginning or end of the level quickly you could even push the balloon with you when you were using the rockets to move it further
  jesus the point is not thats hard its that its fucking annoying
  those games have dave perrys stench all over them theyre ugly to look at and awful to play
  this  also the public domain music arrangements are great
i like the sequel more because i can actually beat it fuck down the tubes
woah nelly  the final stage was kino
  i can entirely agree with this entire post i too loved the puppy love levels as a kid and was damn good never took damage and iirc i could get all the bonus items too i actually dont understand the complaint about gimmick levels when the first game made you do andy asteroids after every fucking level and many levels had unique gimmicks like for petes sake the tube race or snot a problem
  andy asteroid lasted like a minute or what and if you fail you just need to beat a bonus boss  doesnt justify having to do it like 10 times its fine but it isnt exactly interesting or entertaining in a game that otherwise is
  i could never beat the hard path but getting the easy ending was very easy also i love that theme  
  yeah how about trying to defeat pupa pedro on difficult
    lmao the shitter cant beat the fucking boss of level 2    protip shoot at it until it dies
    dem hitboxes  i love ewj games but yeah the game polish is sloppy it works but barely
i tried ewj2 once and dropped it before i ran out of lives i think i have to agree with op what the hell happened there
  ewj 2 was massively disappointing compared to the first one
  the only hard stages in the original were the underwater ones
    i enjoyed puppy love but then i also spent many hours as a kid playing pic related
      i raged a bit at puppy love at first but then its kind of not that bad  however playing it on saturn and i guess ps1 too ruins it because the controls are more slippery and i even feel a kind of lag when turning around for example that i didnt feel at all on the snes version
  on my most recent playthrough i was expecting the cow abduction level to be a pain in the ass but i actually found it to be more fun than i remember the cows with fuses were kind of exhilarating    i had a similar experience with they diving bell segments when i replayed earth worm jim earlier this year i went in expecting maddening frustration and it was fine i think it must literally be a case of my having been a stupid impatient little kid it wasnt anything like as insanely difficult as i remembered i cleared it on the first attempt just about
  based
  hes probably the hardest part of the game
lorenzens soil is literally the only good part of ewj2    the best music in the entire game  good gimmick that doesnt compromise basic gameplay unlike the half of ewj2 levels  thematically fits the game  i mean you are a worm and you actually dig in the ground  several puzzles involving dirt physics  features one of the very few new villains
i never had any problem finishing 1 but everytime i got to the isometric level in 2 the fun just stopped
  lorenzens soil is literally the only good part of ewj2    damn son
for some reason i remember the first miniboss of this game taking like half an hour to beat on hard mode its a rolling pile of junk and it would get stuck into its driving animation so it was annoying to alternate jump/fire constantly plus it soaked every bullet and special gun i had to the point where i had to wait for the free bullets    i never understood what the deal was with that also i think its health recharged if you got hit it made me stay away from hard mode forever way more than down the tubes
  same but i was gonna post this
    i just liked ewj2 for the variety of gameplay it wasnt just a straight platformer it would throw you in different situations and you had to deal with it your gun digs you bounce puppies across the screen you fly around shooting things you swim around then do a game show flying king was a yawn or annoyance depending on how you played it but the final level race was always shit you either knew the pattern and how to deal or you didnt it was just boring as fuck i loved the rest of the game though maybe not flying king so much
regardless on what you think of ew2 the ending is a masterpiece
  puppy love was the game that introduced me to that oldtimey italian music they later used in the spiderman 2 game    jim if i flip these puppies peter is going to flip his lid
  thinking back on it im kinda surprised that ewj didnt catch on more with mall goth types it has the random humor and dark surreal setting i could totally some early 2000s 16 year old white girl wearing an xxl evil the cat shirt i guess ewj was just too ahead of its time to catch on with that particular scene
  wtf am i reading
is virtua racer for the genesis worth it if you already have the saturn version im not getting a 32x
youre rich bko buy whatever you want
  not unless you really like starfoxesque choppy framerates
  worth it  there are very few games that arent worth a buck which is what this game goes for outside the typical bandwagoner places
well its better than the saturn port and is the only game on the system which cant be run from a flashcart so yeah id say its worth getting      ironic that such a massively expensive game would turn out to be one of the cheapest and most widely available on the used market
its a product of its time the framerate and 3d are really poor i mean at the time watching something like that running on a megadrive was amazing but it really does not hold up there was a great version of the game on the ps2 and its actually superior to the arcade since it runs at 60fps its the best version of the game hands down
  the sega ages 2500 version handles appallingly    bbut muh 60fps
  virtua racer  racing but at least you didnt call it virtual like most pricks
i want the vr genesis cart for completions sake since its the only game that used an accelerator chip
  no you dont if you did youd have spent 5 bucks on ebay to complete your collection
what does /vr/ think of the croc games
  only played the first it was decent but spyro and crash were better
i always liked that green nigger more than yoshi even though paradoxically the latter is the main inspiration for croc very hardcore game great soundtrack colorful settings and overall just a fun experience
    comfy games
uh  splash  iesus
bump
  i think that whoever tried to force that kekcroc thing should die in a fire
  with a more responsive and less pseudotankish controls the first one could have been a classic hasnt really aged well never played the second  hazoo
    argonaut was a pretty cool guy eh got screwed by nintendo and doesnt afraid of anything
  rock around the croc
  i remember my parents got me the first and i had no sense of value as a child and treated my games like shit i disliked croc so much i gave it to my cousin for free and somehow still wound up with a copy minus the manual
  that green nigger  god fucking damn it why do i find this so funny
  get those alligator bastards out of this croc thread
  the first game has awful controls only the music is good but the second one has really comfy aesthetics
  waspack
  theyre a real croc of shit
  my wife actually introduced me to this game said she played it as a kid got it in 2013 for the ps1 i actually really liked it simple but good and with those magical ps1 graphics i especially love the opening screen song and how the very first desert level looks it has unique music     at first i thought it may have been a redirected tomb raider spin off given the platforming/climbing/swimming and the little brown backpack turns out it was actually a redirected yoshi spin off and parts of it were probably just inspired by tomb raider
100d the first game back in the day  top tier comfy game imo great soundtrack too    the second one i dont know i could never get into it for some reason although the controls are more responsive and croc no longer takes forever and a day to turn 90 degrees once croc gets moving things feel a lot more slippy and less precise      funilly enough i disliked spyro for the same reason i disliked croc 2      i always liked that green nigger more than yoshi    agreed yoshis fucking creepy and looks vaguely gay which i guess explains why he lays eggs
i liked them they were charming
tfw your autism to find all the puzzle pieces finally gave fruit    
  pretty much this everything is good except the controls
it was fun for like an hour it kind of felt like a decent fan game made by someone who loved other ps1 platformers amusing and colorful but not gripping
  its good even the tank controls work ok since the game is built around them the only issue is turning while moving would kinda hurt my thumb after a while with the ps1 controller i remember my friend had it on pc and controlling it with a keyboard was honestly better
i always preferred the second one i remember getting stuck forever in the snow level where you have to rescue the buried gobbos
fox interactive were a stellar development house croc was fantastic
  you were like fuck yes holy shit when you discovered the crystal island    fun times
it has a lot of charm but the environments feel rather lifeless and the controls are too frustrating for a platformer
  it could just be nostalgia since i havent played either of them in a long time but i remember having fun with them especially the second i absolutely love the soundtracks    
better than mario 64 according to marketing
how do you guys feel about rom hacks of retro games
fine if done well but theyre almost never done well too many romhackers have a boner for making their projects as difficult as they can possibly make them
theyre good if done well some can even be better than the vanilla game like star road
  id say attention to detail is a crucial factor in a rom hacks quality  and the legibility of ops title graphic tells you all you need to know about that games attention to detail
the top 05 of them are spectacular many times seeming like legitimate unreleased sequels the overwhelming majority are straight trash like at least 50 of hacks are just skinhead super mario bros or something
  when you go download playermade mods for anything 99 of them are going to be garbage
i really like ops hack despite its difficulty
does ocarina have rom hacks
  this a lot of these guys do them more for a challenge to themselvesor for epic lulz more than trying to make something of actualy quality      i know of at least one but i cant remember the name never played it looks alright i guess
    actually the one i was thinking of was a massive hack i also just remembered 3 hacks that each just change link into mario waluigi and sonicwho does go fast
  fuck you in the ass
    nailed it the idea of romhacks is great the execution is almost always a let down
  calm down and play some golf
  how do you feel about me roming my dick into your moms hack
havent found a single one that isnt shit
  sounds like you need to check out 
good if theyre fun or well designed    parallel words though is neither
the best ones are ones that are simple like the richter to trevor hack for dracula x or play as zero in mmx3
  what a sad cautious tale that game was
  i saw gameplay of one called zeldas birthday years ago it looked alright no new dungeons or anything like that just some edited text and a couple new event flags
  star road better than sm64  nah
  yes and some are even quite good 
  richter to trevor hack for dracula x  sprite replacement always feels too simple to me i feel like you need something affecting gameplay for the hack to be worth it even if youre just cleaning up gameplay issues from the original eg the playable zero hack you mentioned
  holy shit i quit rom hacking earlier this month after 10 years and already my biggest character is given a golf game brings a joyous tear to my eye
    like at least 50 of hacks are just skinhead super mario bros or something    is this real are there really skinhead super mario bros hacks id really love to see this nonsense if it exists ive seen plenty of articles talking about these kinds of games but havent actually seen any of them
  super nazi penis cartel freedom fighters 3 is a timeless classic
  go to baddesthacksnet its an entire website dedicated to shitty rom hacks
  boi where were you in the early 2000s    
  i think theyre glorious
    yeah this mega man unlimited is the best fan game ie ever played
  theyre fine if done right i know people hate on how hard some of them can be but i think hacks of stuff like super metroid zelda and smw are meant to be for hardcore players who want more of a challenge than the original you dont expect studioquality plots gameplay or that many changes to begin with so the difficulty boost is how you get to enjoy the hack ive played ffvi over and over again but bnw really made me relive the game again instead of mindlessly beating it like its on the back of my hand even parallel worlds i see as the same deal    im not saying there arent totally unbalanced broken cheap ass difficulty hacks though
  this there are some cool ideas but its a great example of why you need quality assurance in any of your games even though the dev might think its fun a lot of these games are just not fun on the consumer side and need to be readjusted to find a balance
  seriously rip dick nazis
never been into romhacks but i do like the ones that alter shitty features of old games like the unworked designs patches
    
they can be pretty fun if done right they add replayability to games you love and have the potential to fix broken things or annoyances wonder boy with ram save hack is nice for not messing with passwords
most of them are shit but there some gems that really stand out if you can find them i recently played hyper metroid which was released in 2015 damn good felt like a whole new experience without bullshit its not perfect doesnt flow the same was as sm but i would recommend
playing evil overlord ver of psii and it is fucking brutal grinding for days just to survive
i like them    however i think that hackers tend to focus a bit too much on changing superficial assets like gee now there are characters with new faces or heres a purple sword rather than focusing on level/map/gameplay design    like desu i tend to like the hacks more that use 100 vanilla assets but focus on creating new and interesting scenarios with them
  there are plenty of hacks out there that i consider flat out better than the original game
  such as
  the shadowrun race hacks it cuts out the early grind and gives you more customization at the same time
by and large shit only good ones are translations bugfixes and ones that restore content
    oh god pls link
  they ruined my fucking life
why does it seem like sonicof all things gets all the good rom hacks    everything else just seems to be lol look how hard i made it le kaizo epic
i enjoy qualityoflife hacks a lot ones that improve the interface or controls without messing with the general design
      whats wrong with parrallel worlds i had an old build that was preguardhouse nerf and the only problem i had with it was overworld bomb jumping for keys
   too many romhackers have a boner for making their projects as difficult as they can possibly make them    smw kaizo rom hacks
there are plenty of hacks which make mm games better lag reduction patches bug fixes etc    for mm3 there is improvement which gets rid of all lag fixes a lot of glitches and also has some other additions/changes which you may or may not like      for rockman 4 doesnt work with mm4 lag reduction patch there are two patches one standard lag reduction and another one which also changes other things like being able to switch weapons on the fly but also gets rid of the autoscroll sections      for rockman 5 but these ones also works with mm5 lag reduction patch    lets you switch weapons on the fly select downselect selectstart      rockman 6 does not work with mm6  lag reduction patch but also speeds up the process of many things like loading times scrolling when entering a room etc    fixed sliding in the original mm6 and unlike other mm games you couldnt jump during a slide plus there is a small delay wait time at the end of a slide this fixes both    with both patches applied rm6 becomes 100 more fun    mega man x3 fully playable zero but also makes the game better if you play as x by getting rid of the delay when firing several charge shots and by making level progression less linear you can use a battle armor as soon as you have the tanks for it and zero can charge subweapons even without the upgrade thus letting you open up levels in a less linear way  
whenever i play a hack with a lot of sprites onscreen at once snes9x slows to a crawl is there a fix for this
  this right here     i sunk a few hours into parallel worlds but it is just hard for the sake of being hard you find next to no hearts and regular enemies wreck you immediately i made it to the dark world lava area and then said fuck this    there are lots of great romhacks that are well done i played 3 super mario world hacks that felt like actual properly made sequels or different versions and they had good puzzles that werent kaizo difficulty    there are a couple well done super metroid hacks but they are on the more difficult side and require bomb jumping and wall climbing for progression not just secrets
  what are the best lttp romhacks
  have you tried doing a randomizer     i have heard that hyrule tail is a good but cringy hack apparantly the gameplay is solid but the writing is all garbage and unfunny

thoughts on the mister fpga system
it has a lot of potential but for now is crap worse than software emulation
  recreating the original consoles on fpgas seems like a really great idea from a conservation perspective but the basic problem remains that theres still too much unknown about the original hardware to recreate it accurately regardless of whether you do so in hardware or software
  i basically agree with this though some of the arcade cores are better than mame now    i wouldnt bother with it for mainstream consoles that already have good software emulators but i could see it becoming a really great platform for more obscure systems its also progressing really quickly right now so yeah pretty exciting
i wouldnt bother with it right now except for the early arcade games and support for less common platforms if youre just sticking to 8 and 16bit systems from nintendo and sega there are better alternatives    that said it looks like itll be really promising in the long term i prefer the original hardware experience largely for sentimental reasons but this could really be a tempting option in the future
i look forward to it becoming something cohesive and realiable
going to get one for the arcade cores in a month or so i want to see how close to original arcade display refresh rates and input latency i can get with the classics it plays
could have saturn be saved if sega realised something akin to roboblast 2 could saturn even run it
  nothing could have saved the saturn
better internal hardware and the ability to play genesis games as intended    lower price and a controller with an analog stick at launch
    the saturn died because sega killed it it was a good console had plenty of good games sega just wasnt willing to support it they way they needed to pretty sad but thats kind of how it was
  no unfortunately it was dead in the water  sega of america pushing 32x after sega cd flop  sega of japan keeping saturn development quiet  removed genesis support   many major retailers didnt carry saturns  difficult to program for compared to its competitors    sega always tried to be ahead of the game by releasing their console first and it never worked out for them after the genesis/megadrive    genesis released 2 years later snes comes out and is more powerful saturn announced playstation boasts 3d games sega scrambles to slap together 3d capable chips dreamcast released majority of people wait for ps2 sega really just needed to appeal to more than just the arcade crowd which was already dying off well into the earlytomid 90s
  ok so first of all saturn was more powerful from the psx just look at the specs no fanboy    first chink in the armor strange architecture it wasnt that devs were dumb just that to make something on saturn youd have to go through some hoops which there werent on psx the quads made it upfront incompatible with modelling software and workarounds had to be found the argument 2 cpus 2 hard is invalid some devs would utilize them    second and biggest sega had kindof a shitty library the company always wanted to differentiate from sony so their game library was more mature which would be awesome but it also meant having a buttload of sport games check andy gavins story for rings of power even though they sold out sega cut them out because even though madden sold less the cart cost also less to make and they mase more profit    third all these at the end could have been overcome with good will but another nail in the coffin was user base many segans were disappointed and jumped ship people who wanted to game saw the variety and chose sony thus saturn had a smaller user base from a devs perspective sony was a greener pasture
i legitimately like sega but nothing could have saved the saturn every week someone forces something new that could have done it its time to let go
  i wouldnt say saturn had the more mature library i can remember all the cool kids at school jerking off to re2 and nightmare creatures  i specifically hate the latter because a classmate told me guardian heroes was shit compared to it  dont talk shit about guardian heroes  in the end one is a treasure classic and the other one is forgotten but his point was valid psx was cooler and more mature to kids
  saturn was more powerful from the psx just look at the specs  well youre just looking at them wrong then two poorly integrated cpus is irrelevant     saturn has no real equivalent to the ps1s geometry transformation engine coprocessor except for a borderline useless dsp in the saturn control unit scu and even if it was properly integrated it would still only have about a third of gtes performance at best    this means that while the ps1 has a dedicated hardware accelerated vertex processing chip the saturn has to do all of that vertex processing on its cpus instead    theres also the matter of how ps1s gpu has vram with 264 mb/s of bandwidth while saturns got its vram bandwidth divided up between different poorly intergrated shit and its still slower if you add the bandwidth from all up together    not to mention how vdp1s pixel pipeline is a flat out piece of shit compared to the one inside of ps1s gpu    lets put it this way if you had a team of john carmack clones each making a ps1 game and a saturn game with all the effort time budget etc in the world the ps1 version would always have significantly better 3d graphics because the hardware was just plain better saturn being hard to dev just made a bad situation worse    that being said saturn can win at 2d thanks to vdp2
no while designing it sega should have had the same mindset as they had in arcades 3d    ability to play mega drive/mega cd and 32x games would have helped also
  theres also the matter of how ps1s gpu has vram with 264 mb/s of bandwidth    ive seen this number before numerous times over the years that is an insane amount of bandwidth dedicated to graphics for something released in 1994 how did they attain that i know their main 2mb bus used 60ns edo dram which would allow for 133mb/s bandwidth    what type of ram did they use for video it wasnt actually vram was it
  it wasnt actually vram was it  yes it was literal vram dualported so 132 mb/s reads and 132 mb/s writes simultaneously
    does ram being dual ported only help for video tasks or could sony have used such ram for their cpu bus as well for double the memory bandwidth that is to say 1mb vram bus for the gpu and 2mb vram bus for the cpu
  helps primarily for video tasks because a gpu has essentially a queue of read/write data to churn through a cpu spends a lot of its time working between registers and cache so it doesnt need to constantly tap on memory    also dual ported memory is obviously a lot more expensive than regular ram    you are right though the ps1 did have an incredibly high amount of memory bandwidth for a 1994 device although the ps1 has less overall memory bandwidth than the n64 memory bandwidth will work out much better for the ps1 because it has lower bandwidth requirements no zbuffer etc and unlike the n64 the different pieces of memory are on separate buses so not prone to bus contention gridlock like n64
  weekly save the saturn thread  why is this the first thing newfags do when they find out about the system
    if im not mistaken the 3do used real vram as well also in a 1mb block i was under the impression that it ran at 50 mb/s which being dualported would mean effective 100 mb/s if that is the case why would it be less than half of sonys if im wrong does that mean the 3do in actuality had 200 mb/s bandwidth for its graphics    does the 3do graphics bus even work the same way as sonys that is storing textures cluts framebuffers etc
  i cant find any info about the 3dos ram so i dont know
  i dunno can roboblast 2 even ran on saturn if engine is optimised for hardware
   saturn has no real equivalent to the ps1s geometry transformation engine coprocessor except for a borderline useless dsp in the saturn control unit scu and even if it was properly integrated it would still only have about a third of gtes performance at best    i know the dsp was very difficult to use and that the saturns architecture was pretty shit but was it really only a third of the gtes performance sonic r seems to use it to pretty good effect
  i know that the 3do uses a quad renderer somewhat like the saturn
  saturn could run 25d doom clones well despite the poor doom port  alien trilogy exhumed and its engine derivatives like quake and duke nukem 3d proved it could run those kind of games well enough maybe not 60fps but whatever
perfect thread    theres a local guy selling an import jpn saturn with no cables or controllers  hes asking 30 for it    i want to know if i can mod it so it can play games from other regions if its backwards compatible and if its worth it if i get it down do 10 or so
  quake isnt a 25d doom clone in any way desu but yeah    the doom port was just not good on that system i dont know why since heretic ran and looked fine
    that model saturn
  that being said saturn can win at 2d thanks to vdp2    easy victory the psx doesnt even have 2d its all just crap slapped onto flat polygons
   psx cant do 2d   explains a way it can do 2d    you cant define 2d to be some arbitrary way of drawing bitmaps  its not like the saturn did 2d graphics the same way as the genesis or snes either
  the quads made it upfront incompatible with modelling software  not really back then it wasnt so cut and dry most modelling software back then could work in either quads or triangles triangular meshes became the standard for games but quads are still used in applications that require more defined shapes such as cad truespace used quads if i recall and i still use wings3d for a lot of modelling which works in quads until you export a mesh or actively triangulate a model  since modern chipsets are beginning to support realtime raytracing you may see a return to quads especially since things like memory are getting less expensive  i only wish there was support for quads in most 3d printing slicers you could potentially get better model quality and thus better prints remember it technically takes two triangles to make the equivalent to a single quad   while i admit these days the difference is negligible but when i print a model you can sometimes see that triangular mesh in the print
  was it really only a third of the gtes performance  it takes more cycles to complete operations than gte and runs at under half the clock speed so yeah it does    sonic r seems to use it to pretty good effect  does it
  i agree that he shouldnt say that the psx doesnt have 2d at all but hes not completely wrong the psxs capabilities are limited inherently to a 3d engine displaying something that appears 2d on it is a workaround it works but not well in the same way the saturn is technically not capable of 3d either everything you see in a 3d saturn game is a deformed square sprite in a 2d plane practically its a small difference but its one worth noting the psx is better equipped to handle 3d than the saturn and vice versa with 2d
   the saturn is technically not capable of 3d either everything you see in a 3d saturn game is a deformed square sprite in a 2d plane    eh all 3d is just skewing 2d shapes   main difference between ps1 and saturn is that on the latter uses forward texture mapping    the texturing on both systems is not really 3d either all affine
    it never fucking failed it had a great run of jap games between 94 and 99 seriously fuck merica i had a blast with mine and still have
  he shouldnt say that the psx doesnt have 2d    the psx doesnt have 2d hardware acceleration there its out    legend has it that the sony retards saw virtua fighter at the arcade and said to themselves this is the future of gaming then went home and removed all 2d capabilities from their psx project they had the marketing millions to push 3d all the way anyway which is what they did
  2d graphics are just a subset of 3d graphics the ps1 has texture mapping acceleration thats basically what sprite rendering is it can just step texel coordinates at a different rate than screen pixels    lots of hardware has sprite rotation and scaling which goes away from a traditional 11 pixel to texel ratio anyway
what killed the saturn was the success of the playstation and the success of the playstation was inevitable sony was a far more mainstream name in consumer electronics and could reach a market that thought nintendo and sega was for geeks and children     i personally love the console because its library is very unconventional but theres nothing sega could have done to still be with us today the bridge was already burned
no phantasy star  no streets of rage  no sonic  no ecco  bought renovation software and did nothing with it    i dont think they ever tried to win they knew it was a failure as far back as 1995 the dreamcast they put absolutely everything in to however
  buuuuut  shining force  dynamite deka  sonic motherfucking jam  nights  panzer motherfucking dragoon ii    i dunno anon sega was still prettay good also virtua fighter 2 what good fighter did sega have before    sega
  maybe it had great games but it tarnished segas reputation
    fighting vipers was good fun
  dreamcast  did they really that is probably my least favorite sega system i remember getting my parents to buy it for 350 with payments and the only game they bought me was chefs love shack because at launch it was either that or sonic and that game was awful and i couldnt return it since it was open    i remember having subscription to dreamcast magazine and it stated that the dreamcast was not going anywhere and more games were coming then like a month later my rental shopped stopped carrying the games and they stopped making them
  why would they get it for 350 with payments the thing only launched with a 200 price tag   also chefs love shack was out a month and a half after launch not at launch  but im still bewildered your parents somehow spent 150 more on the thing than necessary    at launch the best games were sonic soul calibur and ready 2 rumble boxing there were a ton of fighters released in the first half year it was released
  sega should have had the same mindset as they had in arcades 3d  but they did  most of their inhouse saturn games were 3d
  could not afford 200 and the place we ordered from had crazy high interest was fingerhut i think i did get to rent jet grid radio once and it was amazing but like a few weeks later it was gone and i couldnt rent it again by then i had stopped caring about the dreamcast
  they asked yu suzuki for his input on the saturn and he told them to make it better at 3d like their arcade machines     of course they didnt listen to him and the rest is history
  when designing the hardware i mean
  poorfags cant into money
  exhumed  here in the states its called powerslave and its one of the best fps on saturn desu
a 2d sonic  lower price  backwards compatibility    cheaper to just get a regular saturn  action replay cartridge load custom firmware onto the cart and then play imports with that    why would anyone buy fighting vipers or virtua fighter 2 when they could buy fighters megamix 
  fighters megamix would be good if played more like vf3 than fighting vipers
  super nintendo is definitely not more powerful than the genesis its games do look better in screenshots however
  the saturn did very well here in my home country i have almost all regular games in my collection special edition is too numerous and expensive
  saturn was just not well suited to the market at the time barring japan where arcade ports and 2d games were still very popular the hardware was so expensive to produce that it really didnt have a lot of market mobility so the ps1 always had a huge advantage in being able to price competitively this is also true of the 64 which had expensive cartridges    the only thing that could have saved the saturn would have been to literally make it a japan exclusive or be so different that you wouldnt even consider it the same hardware

samsara monster addon when shadowlink223
what a muscular being you are pinkie
no rest for the living is amazing i cant stop replaying it
  not sure if this has been posted before but    nashs gore mod is returning as nashs gore mod vengeance edition
  i found it to be boring aesthetically but better than doom 2s default levels then again i find most stuff to be better than doom 2s default levels
  r8 my wip map
  le doom 2 is bad meme
  is this your first map
  how does cyberdemon look
  le dislike of le game is only le meme meme  fine ill give you my case i didnt like doom 2 for the following  music not as exciting as doom 1 healer stalks into sandys city are pretty dope though  game is too brown i just dont like the way the levels look very much theyre kind of boring to look at  levels dont feel like they flow as smoothly or are as intuitive  map 13 downtown is a good example of things i dont like    i dont think doom 2 is a bad game the new monsters are generally pretty cool i just think doom 1 is just generally better    from best to worst i would roughly rank the doom series as  ultimate doom  doom 64  doom 2  doom 3  doom 2016  doom rpg  havent played drpg2 yet but would really like to regardless of the rankings i love all of these games given more time to think about some of these might shift around
carnevil is still working on wrack good lord it looks awful
  ive released a couple of things online though its rare that i finish stuff despite playing around with doom builder for years add i even had a map in some zdoom community project dump 2 or 3 i forgot which one exactly     through self improvement though ive become more disciplined and have gotten better at finishing things ive found that i really enjoy lighting my map and creating the atmosphere    tldr no this is not my first rodeo
  now thats just silly
  nice lipstick
  it kept the spirit of the vanilla game while managed to improve the visuals one of the best episodes ever
  into sandys city are pretty dope  youre absolutely unworthy of listening any kinds of music anon
  ai did a better job of interpreting the cyberdemons eyes and than some actual people did
ive got guts of steel
  hey what can i say i like what i like
  this doom ii did nothing wrong    no final doom  still i can somewhat see why youve chosen that ranking however i dont get why people even itt liked doom 3 and doom 2016 so much when these titles are just smoking garbage that happen to follow trends and have the name doom on it just to cash in with debatable people scriptfest cinematics piss easy gameplay ragdolls that dont even last two seconds before disappearing thus theyre not satisfying enough too much dark environments pretty much ubiquitous in d3 you name it maybe im just a huge nostalgic faggot that wants their game to be genuine challenging and just fun to play
  yes because doom code is 100 relevant when talking about quake  idiot
  no rest for the living is p mediocre desu
  well shit who do i believe now
anyone have a download for the doom registered wad not ultimate doom
   final doom  ah been meaning to get around to that as well     i dont get why people even itt liked doom 3  i guess i got into doom when i was pretty young around 2007 in 7th or 8th grade something like that the first time i played doom was on the xbox 360 arcade and i was instantly hooked the speed the music the atmosphere those were the days when e2m4 deimos lab and e2m6 halls of the damned gave me the chills i wanted more and when i saw screenshots of doom 3 they looked amazing however being just a wee lad i wasnt allowed to play it so it became the forbidden fruit i was somewhat technically adepteven at that age and my parents knew how much i loved modding games    i convinced them that if they bought it for me i would do my best to mod out all of the blood and gore and they agreed and with some help from my brother we did just that and i loved the game i finally had the forbidden fruit i loved the sp00ky nature of the game and the new demons i guess it was the adventure of getting the game that really made me like it a lot i even played around in gtk radiant and it was a blast for me to see how amazing the levels looked even though i kind of sucked at it    up till that point most of the map editing i had done was with star craft and call of duty 2 radiant while those were cool and cod 2 looked good i was just blown away by how cool i could make my really bad doom 3 maps look i loved tinkering with the interactive displays and stuff     so thats the story of why i like d3 so much    doom 2016 was a lot of fun when it came out but it hasnt captivated me the way other games in the series have i think if it had a real map editor not just snapcrap perhaps i would be hooked on it just as much but alas it doesnt and as i near the end of college today it doesnt have the allure of being the forbidden fruit still i enjoyed it shame all of the dlc was mp
  doomgodcom /wads /iwads
  yamagi still has soundtrack problems  what problems i never noticed any problems  unless you think the music stops when you finish the final objective in the map is a big which is actually a bug in every port that doesnt do that  finishing the final objective sets the current track number to 0 which is supposed to be silence but a lot of ports dont respect that
  nah just a regular bitchy faggot      
eternals marauder will turn out to be pic related
  ive seen that hud many times but dont know what its from
whats the best source port for quake 1 coop ive been using fte but is there something better preferably with mod support
  its so odd that in one of the biggest and most active retro modding communities there hasnt been a full handmade hd sprite pack people just keep making these terrible machine upscales
  theres been multiple attempts they all look awful or questionable dont really represent the games artwork well because no one can do id like id and often enough any criticism tends to send such projects hurtling off the rails into oblivion
  its blank
peroshay bibox malax
  not terrible to be desu face is a little silly but honestly in the heat of combat i doubt you would notice it that much
  then you should complain about gzdoom and some modern stuff too with this bait      not that maybe its on my run but yamagi never recognize ogg or mp3 soundtrack files if its on music folder or baseq2/music  while with other stuff like kmq q2pro q2e and such i never had it    in fact i kinda want to ask the pasta and mega op about giving the link for q2e to add on the mega the textures and stuff still works on other source ports and what i have it here is the final version before they quit
  there hasnt been a full handmade hd sprite pack  you say that as if we need one
  doom 2 is just flawed not bad
  that track slaps fuck you
  boom
heres your biyearly reminder that dark forces is a better game than doom and that we will never get a source port so it doesnt matter that its better
  maybe its on my run but yamagi never recognize ogg or mp3 soundtrack files if its on music folder or baseq2/music  works on my machine
  not him but i rather wait for eternals take on all of classic texures most of the deviantart shit that we see looks like something out of a rpg board map    atleast the dudes at  wing commander project is doing 11 replicas for it      grow a spine and use darkxl it still works
  some of the eternal looks are still their own thing outside the bottles but yeah
  deadline still extended indefinitely  yeah pretty much just feeling it out weve had submissions consistently trickling out slowly
  star wars  hard pass
  darkxl  it begs me to wonder if someone could reach lucius in real life and ask him to give the code to the community jedi is pretty much build    plus jedi engine was mostly cracked by the outlaws dudes and someone probably still has the mac source code for it
  the ai one did remarkably well in many regards  an actual human repaint is more work than people think and doesnt usually look any better and most times worse
  i tried it before but couldnt get past the sewer level its awful and confusing the level i mean not the game and it was like a third level
  now the butt
dark forcesgdx when
i love that system shock 1 has these friendly mutants flying around on the flight bay level
out of all the character this one is the most unexpected imo  
redneck rampage feels like it would be a great game with a bit more polish but as it is with the tiny unnamed keys the enemy projectiles phasing through walls and dynamite phasing through enemies half the time its extremely frustrating are there any mods that fix these issues
  m210 doesnt work with that
  are you talking the one with the switch that has four options if so you just need to look along the walls on the first three options for holes in those holes are the switches to raise the water level in the central area it sounds weird but when you manage to get it youll feel like an idiot    just wait until you get to the imperial city it has a switch puzzle that will make you feel like a dumbass      it works but you end up needing to cheat to get past certain levels and miss out on a lot of audio during the cutscenes i regularly play the dos version and once you get past the huge pixels and fucked up looking mechanism its still fun as fuck
  dos version doesnt work on my computer even in dosbox  i end up with lagged input  like every few seconds there are periods where i will coast because i lose input control intermittently  the action/fps is still going on but since its still registering whatever input was there before it lost control i keep moving unable to turn or fire stuff like that
  use the gog version  an anon posted the darkxl package with the fix here some time ago but the op never added into mega    in fact mega op is missing
  thats all with the gog version by the way forgot to mention that  ive never made it out of the first level because theres some ledge youre supposed to leap to for reaching your ship and i cant make the jump because my inputs keep freezing around the time of trying to do it and it seems like its a very precise thing you have to pull off
      if you give me a couple minutes ill slap together the files i have on my xp machine and put it up on mega    its the gog release with dosbox ece and the steam executable for modern control mapping i beat the game with it last night so its confirmed to work
  i also have the darkxl stuff saved here      if the op could upload it it would be great
  increase dosbox cycles perhaps
  this is the third time this video has been posted
  i understand it would be difficult but these upscales always just look off because the program cant possibly understand the artistic intent behind the pixels if it cant be done right people should just stop trying
  the third time   oh my bad its just i havent seen it post it on the newsettler so i felt compelled to notify it
any other wads that feel like pirate doom or golden souls 1/2
  no i had to lower the cycles because i was getting choppy music for most games of that era the cycles have to be set somewhere in the 20k to 30k range otherwise it gets out of timing and you end up with choppy music and irregular framerates  i always set dosbox to have / 3000 cycles for the cycling keys so i can fine tune it   a particularly annoying aspect of playing xcom 2 terror from the deep because the amount of processing needed varies widely depending on the mission   the ship terror missions can require setting the cycles higher because it has to display all 4 floors worth of tiles otherwise you get a framerate hit just like the old days   whereas if you do that normally the cycles will be too high and youll end up with choppy music
        heres the link      if you guys want i coudl set something like this up for jedi knight as well god damnit more people need to play jedi knight
  fair enough
kinda wish alfonzones levels could be played in a single run
  well they cant and they arent balanced for that  episodes are episodes
    hey this isnt looking too bad honestly i would have expected something much worse
  agreed the authors later level redemption of slain or whatever it was called was far more inventitive and closer to something that can be sold nrftl was like one of the many other mods no better or worse    i like map 4 and 7 though that battle at the top of the staircase was epic
    i think its good all it needs is new music and a new sky texture
  nice work anon  i fucking chuckled
  more like qcde at this point im looking forward to when they start putting in unrelated ocs
  your build/config doesnt work at all  after making sure the launch shortcut was set up properly  running the game loads the dosbox ece splash screen then it sits there with a black screen for a few seconds and crashes to desktop with no message  dead on arrival bud
  balls balls balls balls balls
  they said that they were gonna make custom heroes compatible eventualy so i guess that is our objective i suppose
  you are huge  you must have huge balls of steel  lick and suck  lick and suck your balls
gimme some beautiful screenies of dum
your ass  my ass  whats the ass
  ill try fixing it when i get home from work but all i can think of is it needing to be in cgog games
  yeahh my c drive is packed because its a small partition intended only for the os  ive got everything on d drive    also i dont have a gog games folder either i always customize installation and put things where i want them   wait does your install have all the game content files or do i need to go find mine to copy those over
  its quite literally the folder that i had inside the gog games folder on my xp machine and everything is only about 80mb even on the cd
  yep just checked same files and everything  sorry it must have something to do with ece itself or the way its set up in its configs im too busy trying to get gzdoom unfucked to work on it
  nice
  it most likely is a config issue
  speaking of which has anyone figured out a way to deal with gzdooms ever growing list of issues with every new version that comes out    i just loaded up 36 and im getting slowdowns and very fatal errors crashing the game when loading basic stuff like plutonia experiment      only reason i got it was because im not sure which version is required to play ashes 2063
  you have a grassy ass  and ive got the wacky weed
  not mine just found it and posted it here
  works on my machine )))
    thats not what i asked though and its irrelevant  because earlier versions of it work fine on mine
  vary gud
decide to give bolognese a try despite my bias against mark just because it looks okay  decently surprised with how it looks  start gibbing enemies and noticing the gigantic fucking blood splatters that extend over ledges  notice the glossy blood pools that zfight with oneanother because theyre not solid colors  cacodemons and hell knights require a patch to actually have proper blood while droplets already figured that out and nashgore vengeance is going to have support as well  and here i thought i mightve found my new gore mod of choice
while my back was turned  while my eyes were closed  quakecast released episode 2 featuring quake mapper ionous
  i possess testicles constructed of a manmade alloy
  mark cleaned up the code but the assets are still a spiced up brutal doom and so it still doesnt really work with the aesthetic or style of the game some graphics modifications could maybe do something about it but meh
  nashgore soon fellow doomer
  noice  what is this mod      not so noice
  much scary very good
  supa scary but not much noice
  map is putrefier
    this is a proper time to actually use the rl against lost souls         the one time you have a clear shot at the icon of sin and can kill it with 30 bullets   except auto aiming forces you to shoot at the cybers   why live
  vary much supa noice
  doxylamine moon  overdose  with an old version of accessories to murder and nchud pic related is the same on the map deneb colony by the same author    you probably couldnt play these maps with the newer versions of atm because it replaces some of the things which overdose uses as trees and other things well i mean you could but itd look ridiculous and introduce performance problems
  dum  you mean darn
the ship marathon takes place on is actually deimos
  thanks my friend dude
  i got a couple
  wad i like the sky
  1
  i think its dark tartarus of not ive deleted  forgotten it because of some bullshit sorry anon
  100 minutes of /vr/    questions  does the time required to add a custom midi in slade count towards the 100 minutes  since it needs to be vanilla compatible i assume that means no custom sky textures  do i submit my map by just posting a link itt
i cant seem to remember how i played freezing time completely ingame while being able to shoot at enemyes and move around with one keybinding some time ago if it was with brutal doom or how do anyone know how to do it
  the freeze command
goddamn do i want a game retroengine or otherwise starring some of the characters from quake 3/champs
command to detect enemy name and base health
  wanna try asking that like a human being there buddy
  beep boop
  linetarget
  yes how can i map it and use it
fucking closet weebs
  open the console with  tilde  bind f freeze    now when you press f the game with freeze    unbind f  will unbind any function from f
  wut wad dis is
also perhaps unsurprisingly the sterilized ashes works really well with the duke nukem 3d weapons and monsters mod  well besides the fact that killing the final boss doesnt trigger the ending
  no  yes  yes and specify its for 100min
that hl2 demake in hl1 now has a ravenholm demo    
  have you seen some of the neural network upscaling results  its got a lot of potential its not just a straight filter
  adventures of square
  found two pains      did you try the vintage version
  get on my level
  you have shit taste if you cant appreciate into sandys city one of the bast tracks from doom 2
  people really do need to play more jedi knight that game was my absolute favorite growing up the mod support was incredible too i miss those days bros playing canyon oasis with rbots and my younger brother every day after school
  whats that mod and level looks really interesting
  can somebody port gzdoom to wii so i can play brutal doom with the wiimote
  ok /vg/ skips repeating digits  thats lame as fuck
  i mean /vr/
    i thought you had committed sudoku as jpcpguy
  the doomguy avatar i was controlling died  im still here
  this is your second time youve done this    god damn this is some primo failure
  yeah i didnt know /vr/ skips repeating digits
   556  clearly your only option is to use one on yourself now
    you sure maybe you were just too late    
  i just said everything you did in 2 sentences  oh no you didnt you actually did pretty much the exact same thing i was talking about to begin with are you simonoc by any chance
  check em
  no there was definitely no 555 in the index anywhere
smoothbolognese when
  thank you so much its really fun when you only want to relax a little haha at least for me
  so i believe it might be something on your computer because i was able o get it running on both my laptop and my desktop by changing the location in the shortcut are your drivers up to date is it the ogl option i use      hell yeah
two notes having ralsei as a companion in hideous destructor  the first is that his healing hugs are a little treacherous in that the vision starts to shake and fade a little as occasionally it seems like hes accidentally hurting you which they apparently can since i saw my health go into the yellow when he gets too close and starts to hug me at full health  second note is that its funny watching him run around trying to hug invisible pinkies while im sitting in a corner punching at the air
  jedi knight was so good  played this shit way too much as a kid
  they need a bit of manual work however  for instance the original mancubode model has six nipples a detail thats lost when he was turned into a sprite  this should be replicated on the high res sprites
  maybe a star wars fps compilation could work well for something to put into the op
can somebody recommend me some recently released last year or two techbase wads
  thats totally possible but including stuff past mysteries of the sith would probably make people screech autistically because damn near every shooter is post 1999
  i was playing ashes 2063 sterilized version yet with its included monsters and weapons anyway with darkdoom and some universal enhanced ai it basically transformed entire parts of the episode into relying on my flashlight to catch my bearings or turning it off to throw off enemy accuracy with ueais stealth system at the cost of visibility
  dammit darkdoomz  thats the second time ive done that
  thats mad cool what is that
  same mods as mentioned above
  if sandy was my grandpa things would be different around here
  mmmm i like it
  i recognize that rock texture
  gzdoom or veteran edition  also where is that governors sewer guy
have there been any good megawads this year
what are some good christmas mapsets
  this got me thinking has anyone made any splatoon wads
  it would be neat to have a ketchupbased mod where you gain points by painting the map in blood i dont know what it would do beyond that though
how do i stay on target when im making a large map    i keep thinking just one small part at a time but i keep doubting myself on the details and it never looks quite how i imagine it in my head
  agreed but its a lot less work than working with a typical blurry procedural upscale
  i think screenshots dont really convey how it really kinda does look like some stupid hq resize filter in action    i think theres a ton of potential for this but right now its just not there
re hd sprites    i think a big reason its hard to do a hd sprite pack is because the monsters were made from clay at first theyre not just straight drawings
  im playing pretty much the exact same thing but with hideous destructor and without enhanced ai since i feel like that would conflict with hd holy shit does it get intense the maps are perfect for hds gameplay though plenty of debris to hide behind
  chocolate strife
  last good megawad is plutonia over 20 years ago chances of breaking the streak is zero
  you mean master levels
are /k/obolds a thing    i need pictures of kobolds with guns preferably modern weaponry
  dang that was for a thread on /tg/  we can pretend it was me asking about samson on gmota
    wrong tab
  the first post gave me an error message i guess i fucked up when i reloaded the page
  scythe
i havent played doom 3 in a while but when do the chaingunners or tentacle men ever say stuff like your kind is over that is used in meta doom  i watched some d3 footage and so far they only say you or die in a softer tone
  those voices were from the beta when reznor worked on it
  well splatoon center around not only painting the map but moving around in the ink hidden and with greater mobility allowing you and your team to have control of the map as well as slowing down enemies who step in it i imagine that could easily be fertile grounds for a wad call it blood stalker or something where you can hide and swim around in enemies blood just a little primer idea i guess
  to adapt the concept into something that would work a little better in first person and adapting it to dooms gameplay what if being coated in enemy blood made you harder to detect gib an enemy at point blank and get covered completely in its blood and nothing of that class will see you the further away you are means you are splashed with less blood only giving you a chance of an enemy ignoring you or acting as a blur sphere
  true and you dont get questionable artists taking horrible artistic liberties such as pic related
  true they were intended to be scaled down especially the ones which were made from clay  looking at mr bruiser here youll notice that his face is actually quite flat and undefined probably because they were going to scale the graphics down and would work him out in post    the latex models were somewhat more detailed and more importantly were easier to pose and didnt break when you did so like the clay ones though they ended up doing some substantial changes anyway spidermind had his tiny and dinky threebarreled gun replaced with a big sixbarreled death machine and the revenant was almost completely redone in post going from a fleshy thing with a skull to a skeleton proper
  heres early wips of the baron hes scaled down here and notice that his face actually looks quite alright in this resolution
  
  it always surprised me how much of the game is basically digitized clay and latex models or toys when so much of it has become synonymous with 90s spritework
  
  its like oldschool movie prop making given how many ways they actually did graphics theres actually kind of a mix of visual styles which ultimately means that a lot of graphical styles will fit near seamlessly into doom as long as you put the effort in    a lot of the tech textures were old computer parts they werent using particularly the circuit board ones or all the greebling and detail which was present on the toy raygun which they used to make the bfg9000
  here comes the tech textures
  the famous exit door
  pew pew pew
  this one looks a bit different and i think there were multiple versions of this toy raygun but obviously id was using one which was common in the 90s
  theres three known manufacturers of this thing and judging by how they differ somewhat the mold was probably modified at some point
40k almost had a sskicking doom clone  
latest quakecast is confirmed good
  instead there was that space hulk game
  stop hurting ralsei

i know that skulltag is officially abandoned but why did the mods lock up the site forums and remove them from being visible
  they need to give the russkies time to properly model every crevice of her abs is all      i highly doubt it but its not like its probably very hard work
playing doom  getting my shit pushed in on the highest difficulty   put on bolt thrower  beat a level without taking any damage
  carnevil threw a tanty
  if i remember right  where he basically forced them to shut down skulltag so that he could make his notdoom game wrack by some means or another i think by mainly claiming he owned everything skulltag  he never finished wrack and it didnt do very well while skulltag shifted to zandronum and moved on
just tried out ashes for the first time i think map05 is the most sp00ped ive ever been playing a doom mod lots of fallout and battletanx vibes the levels are a little longer than i prefer though but theyre impressive in scope nonetheless the further soundtrack reminds a lot of the battletanx 2 ost pretty nostalgic how many maps are in this wad
dude waiting for nashgore is becoming fucking painful please just release it already man
does anyone have a more up to date tutorial on 3d modelling or texture editing for the original quake ive been using the tome of preach which actually works but recommends gmax which was outdated in the early 2000s let alone now i also have little idea on how to work within quakes color pallet when making textures causing most stuff to assume the wrong colors when designing    i dont know how to backport stuff with blender it seems like the addon i downloaded for it doesnt save things in the correct format and i havent even started with animation yet
  keep using silhouette of the nme in thumbnail  hunt or be hunted title card  oh crap they finally put in a rott rep    fuck
quake
how the hell do i disable texture filtering on ut i tried with messing around with some commands i know and all of them dont work unless ut doesnt have commands based around that
  huh
  what wad is this for the monsters
  its hard as balls
  a currently wip project    someone developed an all new upscaling algorithm and it actually seems to do a pretty decent job of converting lines and details and make a higher resolution graphic without grossly distorting it  its not perfect but it looks good enough that people are exploring if it can be used as a basis for making a proper hd conversion mod for once  itll be interesting to see how it turns out
i need a quick rundown on quoth and what it is all about
  a pack of new monsters for quake mappers to use not too much to explain  
try to play ad  have to fiddle with command line options to get it running at a good framerate  have to manually enter impulse 130 to make the shotguns fire like normal quake shotguns do  play level  get randomly instagibbed by enemy taken from hexen 2  very cool truly an unassailable masterpiece
   sniff sniff 
  man i remember wrack the gunplay and enemy design was supremely boring   and why the fuck are they making a tower defense roguelite sequel when the first game didnt even get finished
    whats this
  zanieons maps you can find them on moddb  he made hunters moon
  its out  
  praise the lord
fuck it put out a release candidate    
  conductor it appears we may have some issues
  change to software rendering its been a long time since i played with the video settings in ut
please help me out people  in the versions of gzdoom after 34 sound is very muffled/compressed as if im playing duke world tour again  older versions sound fine i tried to dig into configs and experiment with variables but nothing helped
does someone has the link for the qc nailgun for q1
  its still in beta stateso expect to see some complications
  be sure to report it
it burns it burns aahhaaaaaaaaaaaah
  this its the only way they keep it in peoples minds just adding whoever the fuck they can think of
are there wads with a creepyhorror atmosphere that maintain the classic gameplay
  im working on a map that might have the kind of atmosphere that youre looking for but it will be a couple of days before i have it finished music may not be what youre after but thats easy enough to replace this video is a little out dated the map has progressed quite a bit beyond whats shown here  
  i really like itit looks like it was heavily inspired by psx doom aesthetickeep it up
  i had fun anon   nightmare lord is fucking op on uv had to scum sorry p 
  is that some armored core 3 or silent line music i hear
  i always loved the use of color and lighting is psx doom but even more so doom 64 and doom 3 to some extent        yes sir armored core and ace combat were my favorite play station series still play both to this day not sure which armored core is my favorite but i love the aesthetics and soundtrack of 3 and sl theyre both quite dramatic and intense and felt it fit the atmosphere i wanted in my map
does anyone know what counts as matches in srb2kart for unlocks do record attack races and/or nonmodded multiplayer races count
  did you lose your settings have you remembered to turn audio quality up in your audio settings
  where can i download this goat
  i tried that and the game kept crashing
what are some other monster mods that change how enemies behavior things along the line of colorful hell champions and dark doom creatures
  drla monsters
  youre right i forgot about that one i already tried that i was wondering if there were any more i guess for clarity i should also mention ive played combined harms as well
with the new gore feature in doom eternal are there mods that also have some sort of destructible demons thing
  not a retro game and looks ugly
  project babel
  yeah i tried that as well
  project msx/msfixd bulletye/bulleteye monster only
    fun but lacks the depth to make it engaging not a fan of lowres pixel art just for the sake of looking retro either but that ones pure preference
  ive tried project msx but not fixd and this bulletye is new to me ill check it out thanks
  project msx/msfixd  speaking about this whatever happened to the anon that was making an overhauled version of it
  the msfixd guy he seems to release a version vanish for a few years and then release another
  same question for the anon that was working on the immoral conduct update
  what is this
  based and nashpilled
  is this what i think it is
  
  have you remembered to turn audio quality up in your audio settings  how the fuck do you do that i know of fucking none of the context of the sliders and switches on most of those
this fits more than i thought it would but fuck me if the difficulty didnt significantly spike from all the hitscanning superaccurate assholes everywhere
  sound options  openal options  resampler    what is it set to
  city of the damned  apocalypse
what do you think of brutal doom lite/vr/
  not as good as it sounds a lot of it seems off and it ends up coming across as a bit of a waste of time compared to other mods
  promising but was expecting itd have a bunch of cvars so i could turn stuff on and off
  literally brutal doom has this zombiemen and imps can be shredded apart and some of the other monsters also have location based damage its honestly one of the highlights of the mod shame that the hit detection is usually ass
  yeah its my poor attempt it didnt turn out very well but was a nice learning experience ive always liked the original city killer combat shotgun in fallout though
  this is exactly what i was hoping for thanks anon ive played some paks with interesting custom models in terms of new weapons new enemies and just doodads that go around the map to add detail and i wanted to try my hand at the same
  tfw quake and classic fallout games are my favorite   keep up the gods work anon i really hope you wont abandon this stuff and keep making more    this is kinda unrelated but i figured it might give you some inspiration  
  so how long until the burtl crowd starts claiming they stole the idea from mark ive already seen someone claiming they took the flamethrower idea from bd even though they work completely different
  mark himself tried to promote the idea that doom 4 stole from him and that they shouldve been paying him for his ideas they used
  isnt bds flamethrower just a regular one  because eternal is meant to be on dgs left shoulder  you could say that the heavy cannon being a machinegun/sniper rifle hybrid resembles a weapon upgrade in trailblazer or that some things like the meathook and sword resemble gmota  you could say the fire baron resembles that one black baron spriteset from most randomizers and realm667  but you dont see anyone saying that because they only know one mod
when is really low poly going be be an aesthetic again
    looks like the tower defence map in dump3 dont know what the weapon mod is
  dusk is going with that
  i like that it takes place in a mesoamerican setting the rest is meh
  it already is    the problem is that its being done by posers with neither the artistic talent nor the funding to make proper use of it    today low poly means 1k tris and minimal texture work because texturing is hard and takes skill time and effort but any idiot can slap together a vaguely human shape out of boxes    pic related modern garbage
      yeah i guess im talking more about the preskeleton days where body parts were all just basic shapes that sort of look like a single model when still
  its either that or you get hideous shit out of this from games that claim to be inspired by 90s fps  
  i can count one person who nails the lowpoly look and sadly they turned out to be infected with massive /pol/io hopefully someone else can pick up the slack
  it bothers me that for as solid as dusk is with its gameplay the admittedly very small dev team opted for models so lowpoly that im pretty sure quake 1 has more polygons
  i can count one person who nails the lowpoly look and sadly they turned out to be infected with massive /pol/io    which strife dialog script is this
  who who actually gets that style i dont give a fuck about their other opinions
  bug off
  its got the problem of artists coming at it with make it look old and crude at the front of their minds when they should have come at it with 256 colors 800 polys 128256 texture at the front of their mind
  being this mad
  i mean ill take that over flat shaded hipster trash any day
  kind of depressing seeing shit look so much worse than it did back when those were the hard technological limitations because back then people were working within those limitations to make something look decent rather than trying to make something look like utter shit to say it looks older than it is
  its still some generic shooter that theyve downscaled stuck janky looking models in and thrown some awful filters on to say its pixelized
  well dish sister
  hes referring to proteus in the response chain i believe
  hi zanieon
  i really like that games style regardless of its claims to inspiration
  800 polys  woah buddy what super computer do you have were not running this at nasa
  im taking an actual 3d modeling course next year to improve my skills its just right now im working in the quake engine so polycounts have to be somewhat low and animation is done frame by frame instead of whatever they use in the modern era bones or something else if weve past that point as well    so many people make doom mods here its wonderful inspiration to see what can be done with older engines even if it is something as simple as a few weapon replacements a new enemy and a sleek looking map
  its still bones and various constraints unless youre doing movies then you get muscle simulations and what not  some of that type of tech is being implemented in newer games blend shapes and blend textures its kinda a meme game at this point but check out star citizens behind the scenes stuff for some interesting videos on how they do stuff with facial animations and whathaveyou
damn this is one of the best quake maps ive ever played retro jam 6 mjb the level design is really intricate and interesting involving a lot of impossible geometry swimming throguh freestanding walls floors  ceilings of water and it looks beautiful too
  you can make mosaic art look good hence why pixels can still be in vogue  cant say the same for low poly 3d was seen as a revolutionary step in a journey to realism and now that weve come as far as we have the old doesnt look pretty the same way pixels did instead of a tapestry of color creatively assembled into a character it comes across to us as some sort of stillborn attempt it feels half baked even when good effort is put into it the antiquated nature of pixels acts as a benefit as their construction and composition belies a sense of artistic competence and a sense of nostalgia old polys dont carry nostalgia for the past but awkward loathing for it it looks like an outdated version of something we now know in its near perfection rather than something old and singular that we miss
  thanks
  i mostly disagree but thats because i play a lot of late 90s/end of ps1/n64 games you often see a lot more in the way of texture work than you do nowadays and in the case of games like the n64 zeldas and quake/jedi knight a lot of effort going in to making the simple polygons look better than they should
  i love dusk but its graphics are bad even when compared to fps circa1996
  disagree there are plenty of low poly examples that shine ff9 has some great low poly art both examples are working within a limitation and low poly focuses more on efficient silhouette than anything and then onto wrapping your mosaic around a form     you often see a lot more in the way of texture work than you do nowadays  you see a lot more put into the color map texturing now is multiple maps to achieve a different look in different environments the amount of work is still up there but spread out there are better tools too so theyre not fighting limitations of the technology as much
  so how long until the burtl crowd starts claiming they stole the idea from mark  thats been a thing since doom 4 even mark was whining about how id stole his ideas
  low poly only looks bad when it tries to be realistic and even the ugly jedi knight models have some charm
  youre right i just wish shit was still simple enough that really good texture work could make something look a lot better than the shading ever could also when are we gonna get big fuck off pixels as particles again
  well that was short
  i remember playing through that map as well in the egypt jam its a really creative use of water i was slightly annoyed by some of the enemy placement combined with the sluggish movement being in water gives you i still think its an excellent use of quakes limited water physics next time i play through a map jam i need to make note of all the gems i come across
  they turned out to be infected with massive /pol/io  thats even better
  shhh hell get mad
  please make a falloutmod in quake
  wonder if its anyone we know
  catmouth island was made with n64standards in mind characters were all under 300 triangles and the rest was made using as few triangles as possible all using the same texture atlas and compressed animations with simple rigs the only thing that made it about 50 mb in size was a lot of sound and music
  not him but i think devil daggers has a very strong low poly aesthetic however it doesnt have level design which is a shame
spotted this in the window of a tattoo parlor a few years back
  who
  hes not wrong
  does banjo conker perfect dark etc look like that trash
  possibly the most correct sign ive ever seen in a window
are there any mods that let me play with blood weapons/enemies in doom but not the levels that everyone keeps trying to remake
  n64 standards  no texture filtering  twocolor textures on everything  high resolution font    yeah no    that doesnt look anything like an n64 game whatsoever
  thats just doom3/quake4/prey
  theres one called ultra crispy
  thats really more of a bloodlike mod where the creator loosely compiled some blood graphics and sounds with a lot of other things to also mix in blood 2
  who mentioned n64
   
  now im not sure if that picture is the same game
  oh i think he meant technical standards not style
  looking at screenshots its definitely not  looks like catmouth island also has higher res textures though the poly count looks within n64 limits
download and install reshade to have that beautiful ssao in muh quake  doesnt work  well at least i have ut2004  doesnt work
  read this  check utzone  404  darkest timeline
  so many unreal mods lost to the echoes of time and abandoned hard drives
  lowpoly in q1/q2/q3 is beautiful
  there is a guy in the epic and beyond forums carbon who has a back up of all the shit that was produced for the game he tried to share it but the torrent was hueg i couldnt participate i didnt have the space or the speed at the time
  ssao  in quake  stop this
im glad i dont care about unreal
  okay
  beat this on super slimey yesterday and i feel fucking blessed  godlike arts and environmentsespecially 2  level designs are tight as fuck   weapons that feels great to use  fucking spinning fork spoon    where can i find all the fanmade mods i actually bought chex cereal for this shit
  blocks ur path
  why what did unreal do to you
    okay where the hell are the last two secrets on the hub map is it the two locked doors facing each other or are they actually locked with nothing behind them
  
  just play brutal doom its a bit fun
  go fuck yourself
  final doomer
  best heavy machine gun in any mod
  your screenshot looks like a lot of walking i dont like this
  theres a few maps and chex quest 3 the official one but thats mostly it bd and samsara/high noon drifter have monster replacers for them and theres a patch to play doom mods in chex but not much else
lowpoly thing
  i cant think of any game from the 90s era which had textures this clean and high res also thats far higher poly than most mid to late 90s 3d games
  well thats an emulated ps1 game it was possible and still looked great its just the emulators making it look way better than it really is
  easiest way to date stuff like that is that ut99 was considered good looking for the time and that obviously came out towards the end of the 90s
when your 100 minutes map becomes countless hour passion project  maybe some other project will want it
  that would look awesome in quake  little mushroom dudes in the swamp punching rangers knees
  too wobbly quake models seem to be animated in a more rigid manner spawn are the closest probably but even they arent quite as gelatinous
  to elaborate it does look good and it is a very fine looking and animated lowpoly shroomcreature but it just doesnt seem to be taken out of quake to me
  steve  banjo  sora  walugi  sans  shadow    im willing to sacrifice doomguy never being in smash if it saves us from the shit show of either of those other characters getting in
how would you simulate a thunderstorm in    i know we have the lightning effect from r667 but im wanting more ideas on how its done i cant imagine a way to do lightning rolling inside clouds hanging overhead for instance
  quake models seem to be animated in a more rigid manner  combination of archaiac tools a 10 fps animation rate that looks like shit for most models with interpolation because of the low precision those frames have to adhere to and being basically the first fucking devs to make that jump to 3d in that form in the first place
  how often do you look up
  almost never but i did manage to find the one in the library   4/5 maps feelsbadman
  what secret maps have you found so far then    i hope i didnt hide the buttons too well
  bobby the bathroom one the goat one and the library one
  ah so youre missing the very first secret map    look behind the barrels
  nvm found it  hahaha
  i noticed a glitch with hub ladder btw if you move off it quickly before you touch it it lets you fly around the map
  oh it also lets you fly through all the maps lol
  fuck
  it fits with the theme though doomguy is a spoonky ghost
since it seems to run mostly fine heres a compatibility patch to run doom mods with strife mostly without gamebreaking issues for most mods        little forewarning if you use the weapon replacer youll probably want the sigilpk3 or else later bosses cant be killed    also doom stuff from shops and like one npc drops at your feet so you pick it up when you move kind of stuck that way till i can be arsed to use a better solution    also minor update to my other patches mostly just minor fixes ways to unfuck forced skill levels specially for hexen and optional alternative shit just because        
does anybody know where i can find textures for a larger door than this its 128 in size  for reference heres an idea of how large that is    im wanting a larger door for a larger monster to walk through
  pic fucking related because thats the one thing i forgot    also space hunter is fun
  i liked the secret ending btw   did you manage to recreate the glitch
  works on my machine  
  square up nigga
what is your favorite doom texture and why is it pic related you can use this bad boi on literally any map ever
  i associate that texture with a lot of doom 2s less nice aesthetics so im not in love with it    i like the zimmer textures a lot though
  i associate it with rjspace and it pairs well with your standard e1 textures
  post screenies of rjspace
  hello did you want more modwall than any one man can handle
  any rjump maps since then other than rjumpextreme
  i havent kept up with that stuff but if theyd be anywhere theyd be on the zdaemon forums  so probably not
  good thing nnn is over
  but rjumpextreme was made for skulltag only so logically speaking any new ones should be on zandronum now
  a smasher should literally never talk shit about other fanbases ever
  most rj maps are for zdaemon though and grognards are picky about their physics  the only three i can think of that used skulltag air physics were rjumpn rjump2 and rjumpextreme and rjumpn/rjump2 are kinda garbage
  you can always start again
when your 100 minutes entry becomes a 32 map megawad  help
  the only way you could possibly make 32 maps in 100 minutes is with oblige if that is not the case what is your secret
  my secret is that it stopped being a 100 minutes entry long ago
  were all counting on you good luck
  once you pop you just cant stop
  based mapper  how many maps so far then
anyone else find it enormously satisfying comparing the complexity of your map at the outset vs when its nearly done its invigorating and sort of gives you the energy to make the final push to complete the level pic related
  i kind of get that satisfaction just with whatever mod stuff i do like using a simple graphic as a base and then frankensteining together something pretty nice
  thanks im debating having it keyed at low fps but i probably wont go as low as quake its for gzdoom anyways
    default  i tried messing with options and copying configs from previous versions  that didnt help
  itd be funny if they modeled doomguys face and made it more faithfull than in qc
  more faithfull than in qc  so take qcs model and just stretch it vertically a bit
  but it looks fine as is
  different color/tone of hair  eyes are brown  smaller ears  aspect ratio
  those could be easily mended in like less than 10 minutes you dont need a complete rework for that
  i think such a task would end up a little more complicated than that i wish someone would try and tackle such a task though  in the event that doomguy would officially end up in smash id fucking kill myself
doom wad idea doomguy tries to be in smash by fighting against other characters that also want to be in
  then after winning sakurai still doesnt let him in because he has no idea who the fuck he is and just puts in whatever deranged bullshit he feels like adding so doomguy fucking kills him takes his place becomes the new god of the smashverse and nobody tries to stop him because theyre too scared shitless to do so
  aaat least he mentioned carmack as the father of fps in an interview  off to playstation all stars 2
what are some good universal mods /vr/
am i shit for suffering my through thy flesh consumed im on perfect hatred
  doom 2016 is mainstream you know its very likely he knows who he is even if he never knew about the original game he has also talked about fps and john carmack before anyway    also i didnt know that ridley k rool and simon were deranged bullshit or do other additions you dont like magically make those not count
  check  
quake
  its much more difficult than the first 3 episodes probably every firsttime player felt the same
    thy flesh consumed was made after doom 2 and for the first two maps perfect hatred especially the mappers just went full asshole mode out of the gate the rest of the episode is obnoxious but doable by comparison
  huh
i like the concept of the ralsei mod but itd like to see it with other characters
  imp tan or hell knight dame follower
  the first couple of maps of that episode are pretty cruel it calms down a lot by the middle
  those wouldnt be hard youd just rip the assets out and jam them in    hell you could probably have a version of the fire demon chick from high noon drifter
how do i go about setting up q1 for coop
hey /vr/ could you guys please help me out this once recently i found videos of a work in progress doom wad based on my favorite game tormentorxpunisher though it was from a year ago and is clearly not in development anymore i desperately want to find whatever version of the wad is out there but cant find it if you can could you atleast tell me who was making this it would mean a lot to me videos  and 
have a merry christmas /doom/
  dont forget that theres doom 1  2 for gameboy and doom 64  all the games except doom 3 and final doom are on nintendo consoles  so far doomguy supprters seem to be the most chill
  holy shit you are so mad over something so completely unimportant
  merry christdoommas hoping id does something for dooms anniversary
im playing hideous destructor and the manual says that there are reloading stuff on the stock of the liberator i havent yet figured out how to use it to melt down some zm66 magazines  is there a particular keybind for it
  animes  when will doom have a goblin slayer wad
  when you make it
is there any reason newer versions of gzdoom would feeldifferent to play i upgraded from 341 to try the new nashgore and movement and aiming just felt wrong sluggish
  i think a new update lets you reload battle rifle cartridges manually but in older versions this happened on level change  if you have empty casings and loose caseless ammo in your inventory it would reload them into loose battle rifle cartridges at some ratio of 3 loose caseless for every case or something  now its manual and player controlled afaik so check the changelogs
  it happens automatically between levels when you have the liberator 776 brass and loose 426 rounds you can also do it manually midlevel in newer github versions by holding use and pressing unload with the liberator
    interesting ill try that out when i play again thanks
map is technically over  160/298 kills  3/50 secrets  jesus christ sock
  goblin slayer is trash
  not playing on nightmare
its saturday and no one has asked us what were making  what a god damned nightmare
  oh right its that time again    screenshot saturday    show us what youre makin
  it was this  
mfw i just beat quake
  isnt manual reloading part of an addon
  how underwhelmed were you by the ending
  the simple style really reminds me of mega man legends
anything else that captures that weird mix of gothic scifi medieval lovecraft that quake 1 had i dont care if its more quake doom wads or even duke
  nightmare ogre
anybody got the latest version of smooth doom all the ones i find are old versions unless im looking in the wrong places
  doom 2 just has some fucked level designs is all
  doom 3  2016          first try on google
  anybody    im trying to make a door that looks like a cyberdemon would walk through it without having to duck his head
  q3 was good looking from tech standpoint ut99 good looks were in its graphical style that worked really well for that kind of higher end of low poly but from technical standpoint it was lagging behind
  eh i meant to play on hard but forgot to change the cfg file and realized too late ill have to replay it on skill 2 and find more secrets sucks that you you cant leave the exit room to explore more unless thats a secret in itself i missed
  ultimate doom the way id did released 
how exactly are you supposed to implement this texture into a map with an arch    do you make a 3d arch and then use this texture repeatedly on each section of the arch and line it up
  what difficulty
  yes or make a square apply the texture then clip the square until it matches the arch
  im sorry can you explain that  clip the square
  what map editor are you using
  oh wait are you using that texture in doom hence why you had to specify 3d arch cant help you at all sorry thought you meant mapping for quake given thats a q1 texture  my mistake
      doombuilder 2
  do you make a 3d arch and then use this texture repeatedly on each section of the arch and line it up  yes
  oh but use gzdoombuilder
  insert joke about captain js art here
you know what i think would be cool something like the dtwid series but for 90s pwads like the memento moris
  yep  
  for doom people typically make the negative space tramsparent and use it as a midtexture
  thats really cool
  kiroshe cruo
  50 secrets  thats quite excessive some of the largest doom 2 maps ive played dont even have half of that
  bloodstained dimensions of the boomed and uac ultra share a similar texture style dotb literally uses quake textures strife fits that visual style as well    outside of that maybe find something warhammerish in nature the only other games that are similar i know of arent retro painkiller feels and looks similar to quake and dishonored shares a similar theme although it isnt really a fps
  a fistful of maps when
    strife fits the bill pretty much perfectly a mix of scifi and medieval stuff with some lovecraftian cult sort of stuff thrown in on top
  just remembered strange aeons should be on that list too
  mod of the year
  one thing you might need to consider is the age of the clay models they were j know to melt and deform under the lights while scanning and break apart while being posed the original sculpt might have been slightly more detailed  the latex models where much more resilient and were made by an experienced professional while adrian was primarily a 2d artist and was not intimately familiar with the techniques of clay character modelling
  its popular on 3d modelling forums polycount has contests for it iirc and people make loads of nice work  the pic you chose is a horrible example of low poly art the texture and poly density is so jarring
  im using hexen 2 textures i kinda regret it
  seconding bloodstain its got some great gothic locales to it
  thatd be cool as hell actually
new thread            the dark forces download was considered but apparently theres issues so ill leave it out until then
is there anyone out there working on an ode or an fpga repalcement for this thing right here    if you tell me to google it i wil laugh at you and go masturbate to my porn tumblr
bing it
  haha im still going to masturbate
  duck it
i ordered a mega ever drive from stone age gamer on the first day of the black friday sale they still havent shipped my order and only say it will ship soon anyone else have this problem im starting to regret not buying off amazon but i love the usa style cartridge
  i ordered 3 everdrives during the sale and they recently messaged me saying they should ship any day now shouldnt be too long anon unless yours is on backorder
i got my gchd and sd2snes from them yesterday
    thanks for giving me hope i ordered as soon as the sale started so theres no reason i should be moved to the backorder list
  not ordering directly from krikkz
  3 months shipping from ukraine and a ribbed for your pleasure cart
  and a ribbed for your pleasure cart  damn right western snes carts look like shit
  sag sells jp/pal style carts that why i got with my sd2snes
  na snes carts are functionally superior due to top label but i was specifically referring to cartridges for the genesis /mega drive
  it took over 3 months to get my order from him and that was after waiting a month for it to even ship all the while he was happy to charge my card as soon as i placed the order and his customer service goons assured me it was on its way buying direct from that guy is a fools errand
  dont expect it before january lol
  i usually have good service when buying directly from him but i will never buy anything from him on black friday ever again it usually takes about three weeks for something to arrive normally and i understand that it would take longer during the holiday season but i didnt get my purchase until the very end of january two months later and his customer service tool scolded me for me even asking what the status of the order was because it didnt ship until fucking january that wasnt a very good experience
  dude they are probably pounded with black friday sales if they are out of stock its usually a week or two til they ship youve waited this long to get a deal on a flashcart a couple weeks longer isnt going to hurt you    if you ordered a custom shell or sticker or such it states right there they have to make it before they ship it and thats if the boards are in stock part of getting the us style shell is that they have to cut the slots in it    btw before i trigger someones autism im not defending this this is just kind of the nature of buying from small businesses on the internet the company is probably one dude so it might take a few days longer to get a product
  oh samefag here my gamegear one says it has shipped on nov 24th so it probably depends on stock levels and if they have to make the shell or customize it
  i ordered one from a chink site and it arrived in a few days and cost me a fraction of the price sucks to be you
  the irony here is that youd probably still get it faster than from stoneage
  i think i got mine on taobao it was like 120 total for an x7 sucks i had to pay shipping twice from the warehouse to the some guy and then from that guy to me
theyre saying i should have it saturday ive never ordered from them before and i know small operations like this will sometimes outstrip their ability  customization for these things is bullshit i also got a scart cable half off with my order so thats nice
  yea just chill this isnt a huge corporation like amazon exploiting workers its just him packaging and sending out the 100 orders he probably got on bf
will /vr/ be getting one
  no
  good god no if i wanted to play on my crt id use a real genny and a flashcart or a wii if i wanted to play on my flatscreen id use an accurate emulator
another depraved interim of emulation and playing on real hardware ill just boot up my genesis and not throw money at whatever the hell this is
well i dont have a genesis or a mega everdrive so i will probably get this and the upcoming dac theyre going to be putting out
  i will so i can play reprise romhacks and fantrans
  no cd emulation and no 32x support at all no thanks
  yes ive preordered one ive also got an nt mini and super nt which are great fuck the naysayers    basically theyve replaced my real consoles pal but are an extravagance more than anything id just as easily recommend a dedicated emulation pc
  whats this new scam device this week
  ive preordered one  you utter fucking retard
  i have confidence analogue and kevtris will deliver im more than happy with their previous products
  official 32x support will almost certainly come eventually and once hacked its up to the community to put a mega cd core on the thing although im really interesting in seeing this connected to a real sega cd
  how does it look attached to the sega cd seems rather small and like it would look odd together
  buying a product in the hope of a feature maybe eventually being supported some time in the future is incredibly retarded    youre deluding yourself if you think development will continue on this thing after its released analogue will just move on to their next cash grab and the community is more interested in the mister anyway
  analogue mega sg an fpgabased clone genesis    basically a boutique product that rustles /vr/s jimmies look out for the following comments in upcoming posts    but fpga is still emulation  but muh bugs  but crts and real hardware is better  but muh runahead  190 and no controller    etc etc
try finding hd graphics genesis  mono output unless modded  ok how about a model 2  needs to be a va4 short em shield with square punches  youll still want to do the mega amp mod  pretend the model 3 doesnt exist  whatever i found and modded my model 1 im all set  how much is an everdrive  fuck ok lets just plug in the scart cable already  what are those ugly vertical lines is my console broken    yeah forget about this scam just pick up any ol genny easy peasy
  well the community has to get the mister to a point where its not a mess first whether you get an analogue clone an original console  mods and everdrive or cobble together a mister they all cost about as much
  230 and no controller  ftfy
  if youre looking for the real scam look up polymega    two months since trousering half a mil in a crowdfundingdisguisedaspreordering campaign after backtracking on their hybrid emulation claim and with massive questions on whether this thing even really exists/works just five months before its due to ship theyve managed just one update to their customers  a shill tweet from their mate
its already ordered thinking of buying a sega cd to plug into it soon but i want some explanation of how it looks and works from analogue first
  nope it isnt that expensive after shipping unlike the super nt its only 205
  thats a blatant lie and you know it    original console 30 ebay pricing  everdrive 70  total cost 100    mister 130  sdram board not actually required for genesis but well include it anyway 30  total cost 160    mega sg 190  shipping 40  total cost 230    the mega sg doesnt really offer much for its premium price other than a pretty plastic case and a cart slot sure the mister isnt that userfriendly yet but its in very active development and supports way more than just genesis once it matures a bit analogue as a company will simply be obsolete
  the average consumer doesnt want to fuck around tinkering with a project board going through a convoluted update process every time theres a small core improvement    analogue wont become obsolete whilst they are able to produce userfriendly products that work straight out of the box
  just like all those cores were surely coming to the super nt right riiiiiiiiiiight
  okay sure only mister can play more than one console ya dummy
  if were talking about average consumers and outofthebox experiences now we need to tack on the price of an everdrive to the mega sgs cost making it look even sillier
  the odds of mega sg getting a jailbreak firmware like super nt are pretty good and it would play far more of the consoles library too
  thats not outofthebox and average consumers dont want to fuck around with jailbreaks and unofficial firmware and voided warranties    also the mega everdrive is incompatible with what two or three games its unlikely the mega sg will be able to play virtua racing on its jailbreak firmware either
  i meant compared to the super nts firmware which couldnt run any game with a special chip    i like how you said unofficial  as if kevtris didnt put that shit out himself and are you saying people are too lazy and stupid to put a firmware file and some roms on an sd card and stick it in their console
  ebay og hardware no mods 200 if youre lucky  mister 320  mega sg 205 per     youre right i was being generous to the naysayers the mega sg is also hdmi so that saves you having to add lag with a framemeister    once it matures a bit analogue as a company will simply be obsolete    once it matures analogue will be making fpga fifth gen clones what if all you want is a dedicated presaturn solution that looks damned handsome    what it comes down to is this    1 were you lucky enough to have found the right genesis for a good price mod it stereo or amp depending grab a flash cart and enjoy    2 are you willing to invest the time and money into fiddling with the tech of an emerging scene grab a de10nano and all necessary components and get to work    3 do you just want something pretty you can flash cfw onto and fill with roms/cores so you can play old games without lag preorder the mega sg but also pick up a controller
  holy crap why do you believe this        if analogue doesnt provide then the community will come through
  i dont think custom firmwares are against analogues warranty theyve always stated in interviews that they dont mind what people do with their hardware
  what in the fuck even is this post is this shilling do 4chan shills really exist are they this retarded
  its more like defending yourself when someone else attacks something you say is good it feels like theyre insulting you by proxy so you go defend your honor
    or i could get a new genesis and 32x and have it be supported now
  absolutely in a few years when theyre selling for a few bucks in thrift stores and youre old enough to post here ill get a bunch
  look up super nt on ebay and rethink that pal
  wew lad
  well those are made with an aluminum frame though not sure whar analogue was thinking there
  or maybe they just like the item and think the good outweighs the bad and are explaining their views dumbass
  except theyre posting straightup lies to support their opinion about a commercial product whether or not its actual shilling or just a hyperdelusional collector trying to justify his spending habits its not a good look
  that post wasnt lies though
  making up nonsense numbers is lying yes
  i already have a model 1 so no need
  about 40 bux shipping despite being based in the us  no controller included  sega cd unit required for cd games and theyre kinda pricey these days for a working one  no 32x support either builtin at launch or for the actual unit  hdmi only and no eta on that analogue out dongle    hard fucking pass the only thing i want is an nt mini which you cant even get right now unless you pay outlandish ebay prices for one what i want instead is a solidstate solution for og genesis consoles similar to the super sd system 3 or a rhea/phoebetype solution id buy that in a heartbeat    unless analouge makes the zimba 3000 happen or at least put the nt mini back into production they can fuck right off
  shipping is 1470
  2211 here
  so i suppose it depends on where you are im in ohio myself
    look up underage bandwagoner on ebay  kids lol
  i still see no additional cores super nt just plays snes
  official 32x support will almost certainly come eventually and once hacked its up to the community to put a mega cd core on the thing    sorry but im pretty sure this will never happen because those system are much more complex and nobody ever made fpga implementation for them contrary to genesis so i doubt the community will make anything about it    see also    
  custom jailbreak firmware for the analogue super nt that allows loading roms from the sd card slot and an expanded featureset    its just a custome firmware that allows you to load rom it can not load other fpga cores like ntmini custom firware    also all the fpga cores were made by kevtris not the community whatever that means and he already sad he had no intentions in making 32x or sega cd cores
  other than the cartridgeconnector is there any reason the nt or super nt cant run the megadrivefpgaemu
  this shit like the mega sg is designed for hobbyist boomers with too much extra cash and not enough common fucking sense
  everdrive 70    genesis everdrives cost 25 dollarydoos actually and they can play every single game except virtua racing because of the svp chip
its fucking cold out post some music from snow levels  
  i fucking hate holidays but snow levels are ok
    lmao i somehow missed the link but snowman was the first one that came to mind sorry  
  
  came to post this one
      these anons are my bros one of my alltime top tracks
        
    
one of the best imo  
ill show you best snow level music  
      maybe not the best snow music but i do love this game snow levels on cold days are the best
  its fucking cold out  must be nice to live in america its like 36c in australia shits fucked  have some summer music instead aye  
no megaman song        
  
do these count        
  that reminded me of this  
that rhodes piano    
    much better than freezeezy peak with its christmasy theme nothing against xmas but cold doesnt equal xmas  plus theres a volcano version of this hailfire peak was such an amazing idea great level
whats a randomizer  a randomizers is a program/website that creates randomized roms by shuffling various game components around to create a new experience based off of the original while commonly used for speedrunning contests theyre fun to play even from a casual perspective     whoa you got a list for me to check out  the big list of video game randomizers is a fairly comprehensive list of generators and is updated regularly      some popular randomized games  the legend of zelda nes   super metroid/link to the past crossover   ff1   ff4 free enterprise     some discussion starters  how is your run going so far easier/harder than expected  share some interesting screenshots/gifs  discovered a randomizer that is more fun that it sounds or has unique features    another idea that came up during the previous thread would be to run a generated seed together for a week that would mean say setting up a super metroid run with specific flags and a predetermined seed number so we could all share the same run
some shameless copypasta from former ops posts incoming  faq  loz  try the swiss 2018 flags itll test your knowledge of the default overworld cave entrences will be the same as the vanilla 1st quest and original 1st quest dungeon layouts items will be moved between dungeons the white sword location and the coast heart if you find a take any cave picking a candle over a heart container will help you more quickly get started in the seed allowing you access to caves hidden by bushes which can reveal a lot of locations also finding a blue candle shop isnt always easy    sm/lttp  you can switch between games through various portals in each which replace lesser used rooms the first of which is the crateria map room  fortune tellers hut if the morph ball/bomb powerup is randomized searching lttp first might be easier due to the higher number of items available youll need the moon pearl and the hammer or gloves lv2 to get into the dark world    sounds overwhelming or youre rusty with sm or lttp thats okay fullyfeatured randomizers exist for both games by themselves    ff1  using the swiss flags key items will be moved to any chest in the world you might get a canoe before the bridge and have to cross the river to dwarf cave to elfland via a new route from corneria to dwarf cave youll need to kill all four fiends then open up tof with the lute temper is your friend    free enterprise  an ff4 seed that starts you with the enterprise and two random characters characters can be found in their story locations as normal try the league qualifiers for a default setup
as an example of the things youll find    in ff1 ive had to complete the game using the ship canoe and the tnt as my only key items which meant making use of the newly added ports in the northern continent to support that that meant the game progressed with defeating garland obtaining a canoe from princess sara trekking from corneria to dwarf cave to elfland which had nuke in the level 3 spell shop for my black mage going to crescent lake for new equipment raiding the chest room armory in the volcano which dropped a power gauntlet and a zeus hammer along with the oxyale from a chest killing kary finding the mystic key in ice cave digging out the tnt in marsh cave and the herb in dwarf cave waking the prince to get the crown fighting astos for a slab and sailing north to clear the water temple after which i got a chime in the waterfall i dug the cube out of ordeals finding the excalibur in a chest in sky tower and finally obtaining the floater after translating the slab and talking to lefland which allowed a class change    in loz ive gone an entire game without actually finding the wooden sword until id completed several dungeons which turned out to be in a shop on the coast luckily i found the white sword long before that hidden in dungeon 4 by taking out a manhandla using bombs sometimes things dont go quite that well    in ff4 ive started with a hook key item along porom and edward which meant i had to explore eblan cave and the tower of babil as one of my first locations after mt hobbs finding rosa and the antlion i wound up finding the darkness crystal from the land of the summoned monsters and paying the moon a visit early which i discovered tellah to be hiding at in fusoyas spot which prompted a trip to mt ordeals    generally the fun comes from the unexpected twists and turns you have to make compared to playing the normal game which sort of tests your knowledge about doing things out of sequence
  theres tons of flags to choose from when generating a seed for smb3 see pic related for most of the flags i picked for my first run    permanent powerups were a lot harder to come by while inside levels because there were more star powers throughout this had me rely on my inventory more often which was interesting
which nes games still need a randomizer
hot take if a randomizer can only work by adding to or editing the base content of a game eg adding ports in ff1 then its not a good randomizer
was unaware there was so many randomizers till now i love that the idea of it is taking off    have been playing super metroid arcade  endless mode shits fun
  randomizers do target a slightly different audience than the original game in many cases and minor tweaks can go a long way towards making the experience better and in the case of storyheavy games completely excising the dialog hardly counts as a minor edit but is obviously understandable
  sm arcade is a treasure i only wish similar hacks existed for more games
    alright ive gotta stop putting off sm arcade it looks like a buttload of fun and without the commitment of having to do a complete run
  solstice   smb1
  removing dialogue i understand but to me the idea of adding gameplay elements to the base level of the game just kind of ruins the appeal the whole idea of a randomizer to me is having to deal with random elements within the original games framework when you start tweaking and editing the game to accommodate the randomizer it kind of just loses its charm youre basically playing a different game at that point
  can you give an example of a randomizer you like what youre describing sounds like every randomizer out there
  metroid and zelda series randomizers work really well because so much of your progression is itembased to begin with and the games are just nonlinear enough already to support it
  when you start tweaking and editing the game to accommodate the randomizer it kind of just loses its charm  sure but the specific edits matter i havent played the ff1 randomizer but something like teleports seem like a relatively minor mechanic probably added to relieve some obvious tedium that players encountered could you maybe explain why it ruins the appeal in that specific instance sometimes modifications to randomizers are made based on substantial playtesting and feedback    for simple example the ff4fe randomizer changes the game so that when cecil transforms into a paladin he comes with a silver staff instead of the legend sword this is because the legend sword is a key item and you need to be able to get it even if cecil himself was randomized out of the seed obviously the randomized characters are a huge part of the fun of the randomizer and it wouldnt be worth ditching that entirely just to fix a problem with one key item so you tweak the content a bit to make it work
  i guess its more of a sliding scale if i really had to quantify it the more/larger things that you must change within the base game to make the randomizer not produce failstates the less good the randomizer is or the less suited to a randomizer the game is in general certain convenience features can be forgiven entirely like removing dialogue or cutscenes but the general rule is still there and im not trying to tout this as objective fact or anything i know its an opinion and i know other people value different things in randomizers than i might
    man i was a dumbass for putting off smarcade for so long the very low amount of downtime is really fun and engaging its really made me appreciate how tough and dangerous certain enemies really are life bar on bosses is a great touch as well it really quantifies how much beam upgrades help with damage    i also felt like the constant fresh action was sharpening my skills more than normal gameplay i got dumped in pic related super missile room a few times usually from the bottom by the third time i saw it i did a flawless back and forth wall jump climb all the way up the shaft
  could you give me a rundown of exactly what super metroid arcade is
  sure thing the website for the project is here      its an ips patch that can be applied to the sm ju rom and gives you a menu in pic related you pick your various options and pick insert coin to start off a run from the zebes landing site after that every door is randomized to give you a different room than expected play until you die or reach the room number limit chosen apparently monster speed and damage will increase after certain room number milestones i dont think i hit one in normal yet    ive only played around with it for a couple of hours so i dont have a huge amount of experience yet but the options are broken down in the readme quite well normal is fine for me easy was good to get used to how everything worked
man id kill for a suikoden randomizer shame cd based games are such a bitch to work with
    that sounds neat as fuck
  smb1 has a randomizer and its actually quite fun since it makes totally original levels i think its called levelheaded but im not sure
    ive never really messed around with these randomizer patches does it ever create a situation where its impossible to win ie a super long chasm that cant be jumped across
  ideally the situation youre describing softlock should not happen in a wellcrafted randomizer ie anything that is on the big list someone expressed annoyance that they couldnt finish their mmx1 seed last month but i havent had a problem so far on my run the metroid 1 randomizer had this occur rarely and the author actually checked in here and fixed it up
  its pretty rad honestly my expectations werent too high because i tried the mega man 2 endless hack a few weeks ago and found it to be fun but not enough to go back to it regularly ive come back to sma 4 separate times so far and i still want more    found a recent and more importantly quiet run doing 50 room arcade difficulty  
  oh shit literally every door is randomized i thought it was more like a randomized map but seeing that guy go back through the door he came in and it not leading back to the room he came from just blew my mind this video makes me want to give it a try for sure
  yep yep thats right theres a catch though the rooms arent chaotically randomized for example if you go up an elevator youll end up in a room that has an elevator you can go down exiting left though a horizontal door will put you in a room that has to have a door on the right this means early on especially in easy finding doors on the right have a good chance of leading you to bomb chorizo
ocarina of time just reached randomizer version 30 and we are reaching the end of a big tournament on twitch right now    spoiler alert progression is always on deep fire
  
  i did notice that about the rooms as well which is pretty neat brings in an element of strategy and map knowledge to the randomness
  last time i checked it was still quite basic and the randomized levels are samey or just uninteresting    personally id loved to see normal randomizer which just changes level header settings enemies level order etc now only if i had time to code instead of shitposting
  you mean youd rather the randomizer does not create random level data so the levels arent actually randomized just shuffled around     why would you want a randomizer that is less of a randomizer than it could be    thats like saying zelda3s randomizer is good because it doesnt randomizer the overworld
  its a really nice blend of map knowledge and unpredictability that really makes it work im never ever checking an area map or looking up item locations but im constantly making educated guesses about which exit i should go for    hit it up soon and let us know how you like it familial brethren
  im a little dumb can you clarify what this means exactly    so if you go through a door in one screen there will be a door where you came through    as opposed to going through a door and you exit through a wall
  so if you go through a door in one screen there will be a door where you came through  as opposed to going through a door and you exit through a wall    yep thats exactly right im gonna record a webm in an attempt to illustrate it a bit more clearly before i start i moved down to easy to make the item progression less chaotic morph ball and bomb should show up early i have two choices from the zebes landing site going left means that i could see morph ball because theres a door on the right wall in there going right means i could see bomb chorizo because theres a left exit ill try left at first because bomb is useless without morph    alright recorded a minute and it didnt go as planned but still decent couple of enemy rooms and then hi jump spazer super missile as you can see rooms that have only one door require an item to be collected before that door will unlock if theres more than one exit the door that you entered stays locked
  because its currently not that good yet the levels it makes arent that complex or interesting yet and they all feel samey because lack of variety    i love the original smb1 and i have beaten it multiple times so i want to spice it up a little and basic randomizer could do the job just fine
  any word on links awakening randomizers ive seen a couple beta playthroughs but they were far from polished
shitty photo sorry but am i fucked was enjoying super metroid arcade but now im stuck in this room im not great at wall jumping but it seems impossible regardless
  its a pain in the nuggets but nope youre not softlocked it took me several tries but i started off all the way on the left when the water is almost done rising run right with dash and jump near the end connect with a clean wall jump and itll be enough to get out the tricky part is timing when you should start running so the water will be low enough when youre doing the wall jump since thats when it matters    oh perfect i actually had a save state leftover in bizhawk see webm related it tricky but manageable
  oh wait just in case you were talking about getting up to that platform in the first place theres a little trick youll need the crouchdown grab to get just a bit more height on the jump see this short yt clip    
  so i got sma and started messing around with it its a lot of fun i still havent beaten easy 50 rooms yet but i love the type of challenge it presents and ill definitely be playing a lot more of it i like super metroid a lot but i dont play it terribly often these days because even when you know fun sequence breaking tricks and things it can still lack a certain freshness this is breathing a whole new life into the game though thanks for the explanations and suggestions im glad i found this
    i did have one question though what is autorefresh and how do you turn it on the readme makes no mention of it
  holy shit thank you im still learning new things about this game after like 10 years playing it what a perfect game
  press a on the seed option in the menu screen it says auto refresh with a little check box next to it turning it on gives you a random seed every time you start the game
    thats awesome so glad to hear youre enjoying it i only got around to trying it due to the hype in the last thread and the earlier anons in this one i really feel like my skills are sharpening much faster from tackling these rooms in new ways    and although  got to ya i found a mention of the option in the patch notes   auto refresh seed check box now added  select seed and press a to activate  seed is randomly generated when you insert coin  you cant see the seed you got until you go back to the main menu    another interesting tidbit from the patch notes apparently they have it working on the snes classic not my thing but its neat
  no problem at all that tech was a new one to me when i started a varia seed last month i also had to learn lava dive which was actually really fun oh and mochtroid clipping
  why would it not work on snes classic
  finally beat a round of 50 rooms in easy feels good man    one thing thats still been getting me consistently stuck is the room with the ramp that normally leads to the grappling beam getting out of there with no power bombs or speed booster is tough im not very good at angling during bomb jumps and that seems to be required to get out of that room if you cant use the ramp to jump the gap or is there some other way
  forgot my screencap not that its impressive to anyone but myself
  just do vertical bomb jumps from the furthest left falling platform in the lava you will need to start the bomb jumps out of a jump
  because its a poorly coded emulator
  not sure really but support was added with v60 a while back
  you will need to start the bomb jumps out of a jump  this is something ill have to learn even starting from the ground im still not 100 consistent with starting a bomb jump
    good stuff senpai getting acquainted rather nicely i see funny enough ive seen some 400 500 rooms in the past few days and i have not run into the situation youre describing and i should run into it even more often on normal but nope sounds like ibj is the only way as anon said but if i think of anything ill drop it here
mm2 rando was pretty fun i just hope the author adds options to enable/disable the weapon customizations i dont mind them but i cant really recommend it here too heavily until a more unmodified experience exists
  aaaaaaaaaa  aaaaaaaaaa  aaaaaaaaaa
  i cant help but think that randomizers are basically this decades version of jackass for people just smart enough to not want to hurt themselves
warming up on sma had a pretty stylish normal run until i got too greedy with trying to save time
  not getting the secrets behind the life refill station and on top of the chozo statue  not killing every enemy in every room to maximize score  why do you hurt me so
i wonder why zelda randomizers are so fun
5168094  not getting the secrets behind the life refill station and on top of the chozo statue  hmm i poked around the life refill rooms the first few times but didnt see anything i guess ill have to be more thorough chozo statue i think i know if its bomb ill poke around more next time i see em    not killing every enemy in every room to maximize score  i found out recently that theres a 2min limit for webms here so i cant really score attack and show off more than a few rooms usually
wanna play sma  download patch  use floatingips to patch it  says its just fine  load rom in snes9x  get nintendo screen then black screen  probably didnt patch right since my rom is headered  use rom patcher js to unheader it and patch again  same result  probably snes9x being crap  download bizhawk for bsnes  same result  what the hell this very rom works just fine when ive patched it for any other sm romhack why doesnt sma want to play ball headered or unheadered it will not patch and work for me
i really really hate that the community tends to only distribute patches of roms instead of the roms themselves its obviously only done that way as a legalloophole circumvention of copyright but makes the process of me trying out and testing a patched rom 50x more annoying and complicated to do instead of just double clicking a rom hack and playing it in my emulator to see what its all about now i need to go through this giant annoying fucking process to play it and i usually dont because its not worth it to me 9 times out of 10 to go through that entire giant annoying fucking process when all i _should_ have to do is just double click their work for it to begin playing    i wish the community would stop being such obvious pussies and just distribute the raw hacked roms themselves    and to anyone saying its not that hard to patch a rom dur hurrrrr stfu youre missing the obvious fucking point it is not hard but it is absolutely fucking annoying to do and significantly reduces the likelihood that i and others will play your work and nintendo isnt gonna come after a bunch of rom hacks anyway so honestly the rom hacking communities need to stop being such pussies and grow some balls and distribute the raw hacked roms instead of a bunch of bps or ips or whatever shit patch files    /rant
  nintendo does go after them if they get too popular like pokemon prism and authors can feel free to distribute the prepatched roms anyway because ninty doesnt care the least bit about how the hacks are distributed
  fucking retard   get patch   copy rom  patch in 0000001 seconds   play patched rom  if you find this a long or tedious process you definitely have aspergers
  most web hosts dont take kindly to piracy and nintendo are a bunch of faggots that said i did get banned from a romhacking forum years ago when i challenged several of the hackers to prove they owned a legitimate copy of mega man
as good as zelda ii is i dont think it really works well as a randomized game with a randomized map ive played several seeds and havent finished a single one for one reason or another the randomizer concept works better with zelda 1 and lttp since the overworld map doesnt change
  floating ips registers file associations when you first launch it so all you have to do is double click on the patch file you want to apply and then choose the file you want to apply it to its hardly obtrusive
  the super metroid/alttp thing blew my mind at first but in practice its kind of lame like ill have a bit of fun opening chests in alttp then get hyped to go and use my new abilities to find items in super metroid but all i find is rupees and arrow expansions kinda lame
  spoilered in case you want to figure them out for yourself    i poked around the life refill rooms the first few times but didnt see anything  behind every refill station except for the dualrefill one    chozo statue i think i know if its bomb  atop every chozo statues head except for bomb and charge beam
  i agree with you
  just read the fucking howto page on the website     the section labeled headers breaks down exactly what you need and even gives you a fucking md5 hash if you want to check that your rom is exactly identical to whats needed it sounds like you have a rom that was tampered with in some small way thats okay for some hacks but not others try getting a better rom because i havent had any problems with the sma patch
  and if ips patches werent annoying enough now they invented the header game
  not that anon but the one above him my shit matches the hash with the header removed yet it still wont patch with floating ips or rom patcher js or any other patching program i use i havent had any problems playing other sm romhackshyper metroid project base etc using the exact same base rom and the same patching programs i have no idea why sma doesnt wanna work i tried using snes9x 155 and the latest version of bizhawk neither would go beyond the nintendo screen      the community no they need to cover their asses what should happen is people should upload prepatched roms to your usual rom sites like the hacks section on rom depot just because the hacking community needs to cover their asses doesnt mean the rom sites need to after all nintendo will go after them no matter what
  i got sm from depot and patched it with lunar ips with no issue not sure what version of snes9x im using id have to check it at home
  check the hash of the rom on the depot  exact same as the one ive been using  patch it again  same fucking issue  goddamnit can anyone confirm the size of the patch file according to my pc its 379346 bytes im starting to wonder if the download of the patch got borked and my computer never bothered to tell me
  nevermind just downloaded it again exact same ips file exact same issues i have no fucking clue
  thats a headscratcher for sure i have no clue what it could be but hopefully this will help  patched up sma that ive been using for a week now that i threw on gdrive  
  it works  its a different hash than the patched rom floating ips has been giving me  i have no fucking clue either at this point im forced to believe my hdd is dying and the computer just hasnt noticed it yet thanks just tried it out had great fun right up until it stuck me in the grapple water room between the starting area and sunken ship without grapple i could just barely touch the missiles but i couldnt get to the door on the other side walljumping doesnt seem to work underwater without the gravity suit still this is pretty cool
man arcade really doesnt like me  start new round  first boss is in 3rd room  room 12 shoves me into underwater quicksand with no items yet i cant walljump my way up period  made new seed  room 5 is that one lava room with the blocks near the start of the game  i dont even have bombs cant move forward door is locked  make another seed  get thrown in that one room before the billy mays room with no items door locks cant get to invisible platform  ive been playing endless but have yet to make it any deeper than 50 rooms so far since the game keeps dropping me in situations i cant do anything in at least the lava room let me kill myself off so i didnt have to reset
   12 shoves me into underwater quicksand with no items yet i cant walljump my way up period    if you entered that room via sandwaterfall and theres no door those rooms usually have exits under the sand at certain spots you can fall into to get to the next room    i dont have tips for the other two rooms because frankly i have no idea what rooms those are based on your descriptions but theres probably a way out that youre not aware of sometimes it just takes techniques you might not know like the crouchjump ledge grab trick but theres usually a way
  speaking of which just got this i have no super bombs the enemies wont drop them and even though i just picked up the speed booster i cant run underwater since i dont have the suit yet ive managed to wedge myself this far to the left but i cant get over this hump i got over the hump prior to it without issue but i keep hitting my head on the ceiling and cant ball high enough here cant go back to the right either the door is locked i know i gotta pull some splitsecond timing move to get up there and i really cant give enough of a fuck to put in the effort to pull it off gonna change seed and try again i thought easy difficulty was supposed to prevent the game asking this kind of shit from you i guess i misread the page
  i did check that entire floor even rolled around in ball form it wouldnt let me go back down i stood right where i came up from i didnt go anywhere    the way out of the lava room would have been to bomb the blocks out of the way but without bombs you cant do anything but die the way out of the passage to the billy mays room is to open the door and jump from the ledge or come from the room prior and make a running leap off of it once youre in and the door locks youre kinda fucked
  and after a half hour of trying i finally got the pixel perfect jump needed to get past now i cant get out of the sand i checked that video about getting out of quicksand and do exactly that i do not move upwards i cant move up a single block at this point the input lag between my emulator screen and controller is making it impossible to do what the hack demands i hope this thing works on real hardware
  i hope this thing works on real hardware  i think one of the patch notes mentions flash cart compatibility
you know playing sma for a while its kind of started to bug me that they count the spawn room as room 1 and give you 50 points to start even though you always start there and even in time attack mode the timer doesnt start until you leave the spawn room
seed 61d5 for sma gave me an impossible room 40 i was put in a room that requires the grapple beam to move from one side to the other and it never gave it to me lucky the room had lava on the ground so i could kill myself
  624a gave me another around room 42 meridia underwater room no gravity suit stuck me in a room with quicksandno exit i checked and one door out i took the door to a deadend and it let me exit back the way i came instead of giving me a random room it stuck me back in the same quicksand room the other door is still grey and the room counter has stopped going up i seem to be running into all the bad seeds today
until now i only played alttp rando and heard of oot and sm thanks for the thread op will be downloading sma and after playing vanilla again maybe sm rando and the zelda metroid cross
  if theres one complaint i have with sma its the constant lack of gravity suit and how fucking often maridia seems to come up despite that fact every time i enter a water room i just groan its such a slog
  yep happens nearly every single fucking run im even playing on easy to try and avoid shit like this the game constantly hands you the high jump boots ball bomb and charge/wave/ice/spazer beams but ive only gotten the speed boost twice grapple every other run and never seen gravity suit everytime i see an underwater room with quicksand i just reset and make a new seed i have yet to go beyond 62 rooms the only other complaint is the damned thing asks for some expert level gameplay on easy mode just got dumped into the bottom of a room full of disappearing blocks sure you can use them if your timing is perfect but easy really shouldnt be expecting perfect gameplay from the player    i love the hack but damn if the execution isnt somewhat lacking unfortunately most of the randomizers ive tried have the same issues dw3s caused a lockup crash when i tried to throw the sword into the volcano mmx made a miniboss stop taking damage halfway through the fight etc great concepts glaring bugs
    not enjoying suitless maridia    i wasnt aware there were people with no taste posting on /vr/
  hur suitless quicksand is fun  go back to being contrarian on /v/ you arent fitting in
  just dont fall in loll
  /v/irgin reveals he doesnt actually play sm  
  everytime i see an underwater room with quicksand i just reset and make a new seed  frustrating as it is i havent actually found a quicksand room i couldnt get out of i have yet to actually reset because of them like you i havent seen the gravity suit even once but even so ive never actually gotten stuck in maridia its just slow and annoying and those fucking red crabs that do like 150 damage to nonvaria samus are super obnoxious to try to avoid
  god damn it nobody has an answer to this
          i asked about it in the last topic and was directed to this for the most recent version theres actually a good bit you can select compared to what they show in some of the videos on places like youtube but its still not as deep as compared to the lttp randomizer    i started playing it myself and ended up doing the bottle grotto first but had to quit at the boss because it was the slime boss that needed the boots after that i beat the slime cavern with the floor face as the boss then went and beat eagle tower getting lost in the process because i already had the bracelet when i went in there and did a bunch of shit out of order i havent played it further but i intend to beat this seed before i try out any more combinations
  hey thanks a lot man appreciate it
smarcade friends i need help patching a headered version gives me blackscreen post nintendo logo unheadred gives me copy protection screen i might be using wrong version of the game which one should i use and where can i get it right now
  wish i could help with the patching biz but when i patched mine it worked fortunately i upd my patched rom here and others have had success with it    enjoy
  i uploaded my patched rom to the depot under the hacks section
    thanks friends
    hold on whats the url for rom depot the one on google aint working
  works 4 me
  is it simply romdepot dot com cos thats the one i am finding
  i cant find that url in google   can you show screenshot
  and this
  o    well maybe your ip is banned  or something i have no idea   because the owner said he had problems with bots from weird countries
  yay rangebans my favorite
    sorry about that man hopefully that other anons drive link will work for you
  yeah got his file proxies work but not well enough to bypass his captcha scripts fuck
woah the changes to how bosses work caught me by surprise in sma had a decent run going still had no super bombs or grapple beam or any beam improvements other than spazer and wave and charge then room 52 dumps me in the phantoon fight not the first time ive encountered him early last time it was around room 36 i figured hey ill just use charge shots to take him out and avoid the flame waves ive never seen him suddenly go flying across the screen from side to side with the eye open before usually he stays in place when his eye is open even worse i noticed i was taking damage when doing a charged spin jump through the fires neither of these things happened the last time i fought him do the bosses get more powerful the later you encounter them
so heres a fun issue pic related i entered the room on the left through the door that is now locked going through the door on the right i found myself in the room there on the right took me a minute to get out of the sand since i have no gravity then i went back into the door i came from which took me back to the room on the left whats up with this why is this door not randomized without gravity i see no way to get out of here any suggestions is this a bug i should report to the creator
  well holy shit i managed to get myself out breaking the ceiling blocks in the right side room i could just barely jump up and touch the side of the middle platform if i held run while jumping then wall jumping back and forth gave me like a pixel of height each time and eventually the block respawned and pushed me up into the upper chamber i had no clue this would work but i tried it in a last ditch effort and it worked
  okay new problem the ceiling above me is not breakable from underneath so what the fuck
  at no point in the game is falling in unavoidable dingus
  break the grapple beam block then bomb jump up there
    i got the same thing without high jump boots i got up there by managing to get at the height when the block respawned allowing me to jump up again but then you discover its a one way trip down you cant go up that way pic related    im sure its a bug that needs to be fixed
  final update solved  they added a grapple block above the breakable one which definitely wasnt in the original game i wish theyd found a way to make it apparent that was added sure i figured it out eventually but this isnt the first time ive been in this room
  bombjumping underwater without gravity suit      i get it you havent played super metroid look at the picture and please go away
  you cant bomb jump underwater without gravity      nope they actually added a block up there to use to get up standing on top of that block you can get out of the water far enough to triangle jump up the shaft man this was frustrating to figure out but im glad i finally did
  so if you wind up in there without grapple reset good to know
  i would hope the game is smart enough to equipment check the grapple beam but yes
  i had it soft lock me once by putting me in a position where i needed the grapple to get to the other side without the grapple once out of a few dozen plays its good but not quite perfect
  you dont need to ever enter this room retard
  were discussing a randomizer here dude sometimes you actually are forced into that room of course there is an exit you can reach without the gravity suit just by spamming jump and then letting yourself get sucked down in this room isnt too bad
  just ignore him he clearly hasnt played the game and just wants to harass people who actually play videogames a lost /v/irgin    back to sma did you know if you get bombs before morph ball you can pick up some easy points by bombing the wall to the left after you get the morph ball
  neat ill have to remember that
getting thrown into this room from the bottom shouldnt be possible below expert you need perfect timing to get out of here if you have enough input lag that you cant make jumps off of the disappearing platforms its impossible
had a damn good run of sma at least for me that worm miniboss fucked my day up he did a ton of damage anytime he touched me thinking about taking another swing at this seed and hoping i get high jump boots this time around
  68  easy    nice nice i made it to the 50s several times and then moved onto normal in case youre not aware hell run rooms become a thing when moving to normal but they seem to do a current hp check during the door transition thankfully
  i think you can just wall jump from the side of the top crumble blocks to the door if not theres also bomb jumping from the very bottom all the way to the door
ok wound up in this room as room 77 no high jump no space jump the only way i see out of this is to bomb jump all the way up the creator really needs to take shit like this out of easy its not challenging its just annoying forced mechanics
  why would you complain about falling in quicksand for that room its what youre supposed to do to exit
i havent played sm in years was considering a blind replaythrough is a randomized sm possible blind like that
  from the bottom you can run from the left jump up and wall jump off the ledge to get up then you go over to the left and bomb jump up to the door bomb jumping isnt particularly difficult you really should learn it stuff like this appears on easy because infinite bomb jumping is considered one of the most basic of the advanced techniques of super metroid
  i suppose it would be possible but one thing is youll need to be able to do things like wall jumping and infinite bomb jumping in order to proceed through some rooms if you arent familiar with those techniques youre gonna get stuck more often than you should
  is it a blind playthrough if you played it before
  walljumps arent a problem now infibombing that will take some time
  because it sent me from the bottom and wouldnt let me go back through only other exit is up top and there was no way without gravity suit      yeah i know i gotta bomb jump out thats what i just said i just dont find it fun sitting there tapping the button until i get the timing right like i just said its not hard its just annoying as fuck i know the sm players whove played the game to death to the point they can bomb jump perfectly every time dont find it a problem but your average player who has played and beaten sm will find it bullshit    i also felt sma asking you to do quick speed dash relocations to leave a room on easy is kinda fucked up too most players arent aware you can do jumps while speed charged without using the speed charge demanding everyone learn obscure techniques instead of just blocking the 23 times the situation could come up doesnt make sense i can understand stuff like this on normal or expert but theres no reason for this stuff to be on easy
alright lads since theres been a bunch of talk about sma lately i figure its a great time to plug the varia randomizer project      this randomizer really shines through its massive amount of flags and options to choose from see webm related you can go through the presets and choose which techniques will be required to finish the seed think green gate glitch is dumb but think ibj and lava dive are fun you can do that if you really enjoy the random chaotic routing that sma offers you can even apply that to a varia seed
another great feature is the solver its a page where you can upload your generated varia seed and it will give you the expected solve path all laid out nice for you i consulted my spoiler path a few times for my first run if youre careful you can find out very little such as just your next target room or movement item pic related is how my first one looked
  mockball and shortcharge listed as easier than bombjumping
ok just found a bug in sma apparently it only keeps track of if you do a spinning jump to determine if it should drain your space jump/screw attack energy not if you actually have the item equipped or not got space jump and turned it off to save it for a later room when i needed it noticed energy was draining anytime i did a spinning jump so if you wanna save the jump abilities heads up
ok red line is the water level dont have gravity suit i tried a running jump cant get out of the water enough to walljump up tried a crouch jump didnt even get as high up the wall on the other side as i did with a running jump i came in through the bottom and i cant seem to reach the only exit available this is the second lock ive gotten going different directions on the same seed ive been enjoying it but im gonna abandon sma for being too buggy for now    i say we should put together a list of randomizers that dont add in gamebreaking bugs to recommend to people so far i can think of ff5ac ff6 beyond chaos and i think smb3 was clean when i tested it
  wait until the water level is at its lowest and jump to the highest part of the opposite ledge and you can wall jump off it someone posted a webm of this very thing earlier in this thread and ive done it myself as well theres nothing gamebreaking or bugged about it you just need to practice more and try a little harder
  what you saw was a coincidence the space jump gravity suit screw attack and plasma beam are all timed not usage based
  someone posted a webm of this very thing earlier    doingmypartgifv
  mhm i havent found a reason to deactivate an item in sma yet but i also havent seen the lava dive room so maybe
  infibombing that will take some time  despite playing sm for 24 years i still wasnt too great at ibj until last month when i watched this guys video on advanced techs the video is about the smlttp crossover but most of the time hes in sm the first 40 or 50 mins covers just about everything youd need to know for sma or a varia seed    sorry for twitch but this guy is skilled and teaches techniques well i can finally ibj reliably now
  i like to deactivate high jump boots when im trying to enter the wrecked ship without the grappling beam and i like to disable charge beam outside of boss fights because holding down the fire button is convenient
  deactivate high jump boots when im trying to enter the wrecked ship without the grappling beam  ohh i like this a lot thank you for this idea  i always end up rushing this scenario and ping a fish and usually get ohkod
  funny part is until a month or so ago i would have agreed that mock and short are easier than ibj
  man this was frustrating to figure out but im glad i finally did  those aha moments are the best im convinced that sma truly does not give any softlocks the only unresolved case is  but the room isnt clear enough for me to confirm either way everything else has been solved
    anyone manage getting past this room in super metroid arcade coming in from the left without the gravity suit or space jump    you can morph midair and get into the stones in the roof and get the energy tank over the quicksand but without the gravity suit bomb jumping is seemingly impossible and i couldnt figure out a way out from there after half an hour or so of trying
  theres some relevant posts about this room round here  before and after too im not 100 certain if thats everything youll need to know to pass the room though i havent run across it myself yet sadly  my guess is that the sma authors made a slight tweak to that room to allow passage but maybe one of anons posts will help you
  ah glad it worked man
  ive encountered that room three times now you gotta make a running jump to get into the pipeline then you gotta jump and ball up perfectly inside at two points to make the edge and move forward i couldnt do it on an emulator maybe you can pull it off like i posted i just reset and picked a different seed
  found the problem spot   coming from the right no problem coming from the left i was stuck no grapple no gravity suit no speed boostereven if i had come in running and jumping no space jump wish i had saved the seed and the path i took like i said though it only happened to me once
  ah so thats the one sure seems like a problem to me ill do some digging and playing around worst case scenario i have a save file on a normal rom and should be able to replicate the equipped gear to see if i can figure anything out hopefully theres not an smaspecific tweak
  just got another one on seed 0000 i forget the route i took but its the 22nd room   i got dumped on the lower left door with no gravity grapple speed boost or space jump i grabbed the missile in the lower left but the door wouldnt unlock i couldnt even reach the second platform above water without the grapple didnt see anything underwater to get me there either
  just wall jump off the side of each platform where youd normally need to grapple beam pic related disabling high jump helps here because the high jump will make it really easy to get caught on the overhead protrusions it requires a bit of finesse to get under the grappling beam blocks while still getting all the way to the wall jump spot but its 100 doable
do randomizers mainly switch level orders up or is there more to it
  depends on the randomizer but generally theres more to it than shuffling level order see  s pic for most of the options for smb3 heres a gif showing most of the options for the mmx randomizer as you can see you can have either game be anywhere from a simple level shuffle to fullon powerup/weakness/boss room/color/song/etc chaos     but yeah some randomizers are very basic and dont have many features the kirby super star program can only shuffle copy abilities gained from enemies and the element/strength of copy skills used
  thats really cool its something i can apply to a rom and then play on my phone emulator right
  yep yep absolutely you could even generate a dozen different seeds and throw them all on at once
  aha yeah thats what i was thinking with disabling hijump its not really a dangerous or difficult room its just easy to get impatient and screw up
ok i gotta ask is there some way to shinespark down or at a downward angle i just got dumped into  from the top and while they removed the wall forcing you to ball up near the super missile i cant figure out how to get rid of the blocks so i can continue just checked the door didnt unlock so i gotta go through any ideas
  nevermind apparently you can trigger speed booster faster by tapping the button like a spaz
    my best run so far got dumped in that one room in meridia with metroids and quicksand from the left side failed to make the jump landed in the quicksand and got sucked into the spikes i really gotta play this on real hardware the input lag makes the underwater quicksand instant death since i cant work my way out
  glad to hear you got through 156 is pretty impressive i still havent broken 70something but i havent gone back to easy after some normal runs   appreciate the questionanswer posts too i plan on archiving a bunch of these sma posts/images into a little imgur album so they can be in/near op for next thread a minifaq for many of smas tricky situations if you will
  no nods    yes shakes head
  congrats anon you learned how to short charge your speed boost
is there a clean dump of the latest oot randomizer google firefox and avast all say the exe is malware
play earthbound randomizer  get this    why does this randomizer suck so hard
  use python branch and stop being a retarded mu virus
    i dont know what python branch is
  some are just terrible and/or unfinished sadly i would check the last updated time for the randomizer and see if it was this year if not probably a good idea to forget about it and move on  thanks for the headsup on the quality
  for context that womans sprite has a hitbox too large to walk past and considering its the only way to actually beat the game thats really a problem  other issues involved a multi bottle rocket named multitinyspacebottle rocket a name so long it overflowed into the next space and a cave entrance in giant step that sent me into an inescapable area
  i think youre using an outdated randomizer theres a newer one that i was able to complete without any issues
  could just be a bad seed ive had a few randomizers i could play through fine yet still got the occasional unbeatable seed mmx has been a prime offender in that regard nearly half of the roms it has given me have been broken at some point in the game sma had a seed give someone the moat from the left without grapple or anything else to assist
  there really should be sanity checks in place to prevent such a thing theres also the matter that im certain the monkey caves werent changed at all when in any good randomizer itd be streamlined to not require a bullshit amount of backtracking for items that might not even be available
  sanity checks are the other half of randomizers and generally the hardest part to do randomization alone requires good knowledge of the game and where all data is located sanity checks involves knowing possible edge cases like the moat requiring grapple or something else when you come from the left but not the right only thing you can really do is report the edge case give them the seed you used and settings if any and hope the creator can fix it or is still working on it we really should make a list of polished randomizers that dont have issues for future ops    as for eb i found many maps had multiple routes between them so i havent yet hit a hard block yet still need to sit down and map out a seed and play all the way through so its possible i just havent hit any roadblocks yet
  nintendo does go after them if they get too popular like pokemon prism  how can nintendo shut down a hack if they only provide an ips file and not the original copywrited rom or did they just scare them with legal talk despite not having a leg to stand on
  thats one of the nice things about the ff1 randomizer the only time ive seen an issue was when tnt was shop locked in corneria for progression for around 20k gold and the highest gold giving enemy was ogres for around 200 gp per fight its not even technically a lock since you can grind it out but it doesnt make for a very good race seed
  theoretically nintendo can go after anyone without a strong case because they know they can tie them up in litigation until they get their way its one of the things that worry me about things like the lttp randomizer even though it doesnt break any laws all it takes is for nintendo to declare that its causing damage to their business or generating a profit of its own for it to get shut down i believe there was a stir about that when mario maker came out some romhack sites got notices that went nowhere
  the worst i ever had it was thunder pirates back before there was a safe pirates option and my forced partymembers were 3 whitemages and a black belt
is it possible to rip original roms from the nes/snes classic to use these randomizer patches on not that itll happen anytime soon but in case nintendo gets crazy with the lawsuits and original roms actually become hard to find
  because of the duke nukem 3d case     ever since then technically any fanmade maps mods or whatever have been the property of the copyright holder and not of the person making it companies dont push the issue for the most part since attacking your fanbase isnt in good taste but they can legally step in and shut down anything of the sort if they feel the need the romhack/mod community in turn only distribute ips files and patches instead of readytoplay packages to avoid giving the appearance of providing unlicensed sequels to the companies
  formgen inc gt interactive software corp and apogee software ltd collectively formgen made duke nukem 3d d/n3d a 3d firstperson perspective video game a build editor was shipped along with the game which enables players to design and build their own levels and then share those levels with others through the internet formgen encouraged people to make levels and did not consider this usercreated content to be a copyright infringement1    micro star collected 300 of these usergenerated levels packaged them onto a cd and sold it commercially as nuke it n/i n/is packaging was decorated with numerous screen shots of the included usercreated levels    in this case micro star was clearly being an ass by trying to make money off of custom maps which is probably why duke nukem 3d won the case the older case of nintendo vs game genie ruled against nintendo though saying that users were free to use game genie to make altered versions of the games they purchased for their own enjoyment you could argue these ips patches are just like game genie modifications and not derivative works but i can see where the issue can get muddled especially if the ips maker is using screencaps of the game to advertise his product and of course if hes selling it
  yeah but the difference here is that the game genie just let you muck around with the games you owned all you could really do in terms of sharing material is share codes so others could modify a few values as well many hacks/mods try to create entire overhauls of the game and distribute the material to many people online    to borrow the analogy from the galoob case the game genie is like a vcr with fast forward and rewind a hack/mod would be closer to splicing the tape to create a modified video and then sharing that video with others i think the legal distinction here is the game genie will work with any compatible cartridge as a general tool the mod/hack only works with a specific game and is thus an unauthorized derivative of the original material
  the issue here is defining at which point an ips patch goes from game genie code to derivative work which sounds like a nightmare to parse out legally some hacks just change values as well like making exp values/encounter rates in rpgs different to make the game more fun to play some replace certain sprites with others which is feasibly something a game genie could have done however writing whole code to handle complete overhauls of the game like in a randomizer is questionable even though it seems like something a game genie could have done if it allowed for more code injection than just three lines of inputs
  the issue here is defining at which point an ips patch goes from game genie code to derivative work which sounds like a nightmare to parse out legally  yeah but rather than telling people what to modify like telling someone a gg code would be an ips just modifies the difference between telling someone what to do and a product that does it all for them isnt that hard to define legally even if the end result is identical just be glad the companies generally let it slide to avoid attacking their own fans or romhacking and modding wouldnt exist anymore outside of official map editors
  well zelda3s randomizer only randomizing items is specifically what makes it so attractive for tournaments knowing where things can be and what theyd be locked behind is what makes the routing aspect so interesting speaking as a spectator who sucks at lttp that is  i love watching top level players figure this shit out a randomized overworld would remove some of the competitiveness and make it far more luckbased
  solver  wish alttp rando had this ive been trying to learn routing in lttp but i suck at the vanilla game asis
  attacking your own fanbase isnt in good taste    wish nintendo would realize this legal or not so much of the activity of hackers dumpers roms the whole community comes from love and devotion
wanted to try super metroid/alttp randomizer  legally obtain both roms  find out that you need an obscure japanese version of the roms
  it does if you expand the spoiler section on the webpage after generating your rom theres a playthrough option there
  in the case of alttp at least this is because the 10 japanese release has some cool glitches and techniques like hammerdashing that were patched out of all later releases
oh sweet randomizer general i forgot all about randomizers  spend the next three hours generating and loading up randomized games for comfy wii emulation    thanks /vr/
  glad to hear it i havent loaded my wii or nes flashcart up with rando seeds yet but i really should for maximum comfy
  id be curious to know how much actual lost revenue they got from rom pirates when it came to the nes/snes classic or online switch roms most people i know who bought those got it for the novelty not because they couldnt find copies of smb1 on the net
  probably a lot im a huge emufag but i still bought the snes classic and pay for switch online
  i had that trouble but found the rom i needed on the first page of a google search it wasnt too difficult but the one in the archive didnt match it
  not him but thanks i wasnt aware alttp had one as well im rusty so i would need to rely on a path at least sometimes for the first run
  yeah its pretty rad helped me out a ton on my first run even though ive beaten lttp several times now i dont use it anymore
    whats on your mind friend
  played super metroid straight not too long ago  the item near the top in the left wall  wall jumped it  fuck the timing on those blocks
i did the portrait of ruin randomizer
  absolute pain in the nuggets but it was a great feeling to accomplish it finally it was a major movement item in my last varia seed
  technically not /vr/ but shh  seems like it would be a lot of fun id have to be a pleb and try out aria of sorrow first since thats the one im most familiar with
hows the smrpg randomizer anyone have familiarity with it i started it last night and so far it has given me random enemy formations in the preset enemy npcs as in the area characters were untouched but the enemy formations were off or interesting timing and blocking is slightly different too character abilities growth and equipment is randomized too     with a game as linear as smrpg is there even a way to make it into a key item hunt like ff4 or something
  smrpg rando is one that ive been meaning to try for a long time now ive played through the game several times but this playthrough is going to be alongside someone that hasnt played the game ever the thing is theres lots of cutscenes skips and dialogue being shortened it appears as though the generator will always apply these qol changes but its not exactly ideal for someone thats never played the game and i want to show them certain things i suppose i could make do by having the tasvideos run on hand for any important story parts that get skipped    but to give you a fairly uneducated answer i would say that a more ambitious ff4style key item hunt would be pretty hard to tackle in smrpg
the big list got a few updates recently some additions and a lot of updates and general fixes check em out here  
new version of beyond chaos ff6 randomizer compatible with brave new world 19 hack  neat
  its really not that hard to find these specific roms im also curious as to what people mean by legally obtaining the roms only thing i can think of is ripping from nes/snes classic i guess
  rom dumpers work fine too its a parallel/serial/usb device that reads all the rom data off of official carts
kinda weird that chrono trigger hasnt gotten anything like this yet something sorta like smrpg i would guess
  
  obscure  super metroid us version is l i t e r a l l y the same as the japanese version the same data 100
i never have and will never understand the appeal    if youve played final fantasy 4 to the point where you want to randomize it why not just play anything else    theres so much good shit out there that people dont even want to attempt trying instead theyd rather play ff4 or super metroid for the millionth time instead
  its a kind of insanity dont judge
  double digit iqs on /vr/ arent obscure  welcome to /vr/ newfriend hows your first day going pretty confusing from the looks of it
  to be frank all other jrpgs have trash bottom of th barrel gameplay ramdomizers are at least occasionally interesting
    a good randomizer of a game with key items is a puzzle game the style of which doesnt even exist professionally
is it worth it    
  no
  only if youre short
  i was just at walmart a few hours ago my location had two of those mini arcade cabinets one with pacman and one with galaga
four fucking feet tall  shitty lcd screen  i pass
  the build quality on them is shit dont even bother
  only if youre a sucker
  how do they expect 3 people to play on this thing
no ackshually a real cabinet is taller and you can build on with raspberry pi and just a little carpentry and programming skills anon    you faggots have gotten downright insufferable     theyre not that bad op if you got the extra cash go for it theyre fairly easy to mod and look cool of you have a game room dont pay attention to /vr/ theyre the video game equivalent to a woman who has to rub her clit raw and shove a dildo in her ass during sex because theyre so desensitized to fun that nothing makes them happy anymore
  i walked by one in there tonight still in the box that was pacman  ms pacman they wanted 299 for it
if you do get the riser they sell separately for a much needed extra foot
  its shit not worth much of anything
    3 midgets
  no the size isnt even an issue you can put the fucking thing on a plastic tub or a couple of boxes the thing isnt that heavy the problem is that the screen is garbage the controllers are cheap the cabinet is shitty the graphics peel off within weeks etc its a great idea executed poorly
  later models do use a va screen thats 43 or 34 as earlier models used a wrong rated tn screen    the controller get better with later models but theyre still not sanwa parts    nintendo games  if nintendo were to do this they will do it themselves and have nintendo nerd do it as was the case with the classics
  the issue with the screen was it was garbage and many people reported issues with dead pixels the control issues that i have read are for the cabinets that have a trackball or knob  is it possible to replace the controls in these i have a spare sanwa stick and buttons lying around
  theyre fairly easy to mod  mod in what way im not sure how you would add more games to it
  would it be worth it to get one of these to switch out the controls and shit and put a raspberry pi in it
  the one at my walmart is actually tall like theres some kind of addon thing to boost the height that theyre going to sell extraor someone there built something for it i have no clue
for the love of god no  i went to walmart and saw one of these and decided to try it out i expected as much shitty diy machine about as tall as a moppet video cab but with shitty particle board parts naturally it uses an lcd screen which is fucking garbage and only has a few game to select upon the one i saw a pacman/pacman plus configuration i assumed the way to exit to the menu to select pacman plus was to hold 1p and 2p start and it was however upon booting back into the menu the fucking bios shitted out and got fucked up and started glitching then finally restarted i finally accessed the menu after some other antics but the menu screen with still a mess of glitches i selected plus and it took about 3 minutes tops to load the game this game is like 30kb right so why the long load time i dont know but what i do know is that its not worth getting
i just brought one yesterday the plan is to use a crt computer monitor and an old pc im still deciding if i should make a new bezel for vertical games i dont see the point of using the inbuilt screen because i could just play the games on my tv vertical crt with a spinner is my goal for tempest and pacman also the thing is a lot heavier and bigger than i expected so i have to make room
  the controller get better with later models but theyre still not sanwa parts  it would be really fucking weird for western retro machines to have sanwa buttons happ is what you are looking for if you want authentic retro and you are a white person with a soul     sanwa is only if you are kensama trying to emulate grorius nippon master race or a sf4 tryhard or if you were raised on an airforce base in japan not retro at all
  id say no simply because its too short you can mount it on top of something if you wanna play it in a standing position or just get a stool so you can play on it in a sitting position i assume this is how they intended for it to be played but otherwise the low height is kind of a dealbreaker you could go with the first idea and make something that looks really cool though
i have the street fighter cab its worth it maybe look around brickseek for lower prices because some walmarts may have them on clearance for 200 definitely a lot of fun having an arcade machine in my home the riser is an absolute must have if you are not buying it for children
  that thing cannot support the weight of a crt
  yeah but dude the happ of yesterday is not the happ of today
  so buy il suzo controls theyre the version still made in europe and are still good quality compared to the chinese happ stuff they sell them at paradise arcade shop
just build a mame cab
defender instead of robotron  gay
  that costs like 3 times as much
  for 3x the build quality and like 1000x the games
whats up with snk and its love for girly men did the bomb cause some sort of mutation where the men are now turning into girls  i mean lizards can do that
  its just cultural shift even in the west you can see kids action heros of arnold stallone van damme etc meanwhile now its all twinks
dammit i never made the connection between raiden and vader  i mean i know not much about wrestling but i saw big bear being hogan
terry is not that manly anymore  haha
  i mean i know not much about wrestling but i saw big bear being hogan    neh that would be muscle power from world heroes
i blame lack of strong father figure role model in childhood and abuse of soy products
implying kyo and iori werent manliness personified during the orochi saga  anyway this thread is shit and terrible bait fuck off back to /v/
  underage faggot thinks girly men are manliness personified    you fuck off to /v/
  iori looks girly  you have some fucked up standards for women where you live bro
  have you ever seen a man wear a choker in your life
  snk has changed  eiji was created the same year as kyo and benimaru  terry was created just three years prior  why would anyone take the time to make such a stupid image even as bait
  posts le funny wojak  no u  you are the cancer killing this board you never played a single kof game at all have you
now sit down kids let gramps tell you a story about visual kei or how we dropped the kiss look dressed like gothic dolls and were submerged by poon
  if you wear an accessory that makes you a woman  seriously the situation in america these days deeply worries me
  nobody fucking cares and no one believes jpop fags had women
      exactly and i dont think ive ever seen anyone besides me uses eiji and his design as a positive defense of snk design and isnt like 70 of the internet jojofags now thats why beni is popular and dont ever shit talk ash crimson again the series has already buried him and moved on     mr big is always amazing  
  ash was just a misunderstood trap which is ironic considering everyone loves bridget boipuccy
  as a white liberal i find what youre insinuating to be very bad and triggering and its the current year and blubber blubber blubber    ok now we got that out of the way
  im half black can i fuck your wife
iori kyo and benimaru are there since the beginning of kof series also shingo is a based retard fuck you for talking shit about him bao and chris are way worse offenders than shingo
  its shitty bait and hes probably never played a single kof or aof title as expected from a poser discord user
murricans immediately start doubting their heterosexuality when looking at pretty boys  and they say japan is the one thats supposed to be the sexually repressed backwards society
  shingo  emo  
  its true  who do we have like these now when youre relying on people like matt damon leonardo dicaprio johnny depp to carry male masculinity somethings gone wrong dwayne johnson fine but dudes pushing 50 soon who is the up and coming powerhouse they couldnt fuck up james bond that badly but theyre doing their best to
  bao  not based as fuck
  no but you can suck her dick lemme call her    princess sevenleaf come here for a sec hun
isnt that a japan thing in general where pretty men sell more nowadays
  you never played a single kof game at all have you    i actually have all the mvs cartridges and most of the ps2 versions  do you
  why yes i make boisterous claims on the internet can you  yeah and i know the identity of nazca corp offer proof or eat shit
  and responding to your autistic claim i do in fact own the mvs cartridges i even own the hyper neo geo 64 boards not that you would even know what it is
  offer proof
  see 
    then weve established that we both own the hardware and youre into faggots and im not  enjoy that cock
lux  biggest cunt ever
one of the worst localizations ever
the na version is broken
generic
did you know the first dos game army cops was released in 1981  the creator roy miller thought it would make for a fun easter egg for the release of the allnew ibm pc 5150 the game was integrated as a dipp chip or embedded dosrom see the article and was never mentioned to the public  makes you wonder what else is mothballed on our computers    
  what is the name called
  army cops  its about maintain order in a dystopian future under martial law
  cool this must be like this bios chip then
  dosrom
where can i find the game
  was never mentioned to the public
  army cops  i never even heard of the game till now  best kept secret ever
  looks like iraq
  i never even heard of the game till now  i still havent anywhere but /vr/ calling it fake actual first dos game was donkeybas bundled with the first versions of pcdos that shipped with the 5150
disk operating system chip  analogous bullshit fuck you op
  lets go thrifting
  army cops  policecops
  policecops  lol policecops
sega made several great flight simulators and i know its hard to choose but id put after burner 3 in the top 5
    it goes full blast
  flight simulators  after burner  youre clearly not old enough to fly alone let alone post here go back now
  its a flying airplane dotard
  not him but please dont be so dumb you fly a plane in 1942 and gradius as well are you going to mistake those for flight sims too after burner is a rail shooter like space harrier where you happen to control a jet ms flight simulator thats what a flight sim game is
  yes it is after burner 3 also lets you in the cockpit
  nigga pleaseace combat gives you a cockpit view and its not a sim either go play air warrior 2 and then come back when youre a real man
  go play an actual flight sim game and you will get the difference
  cockpit view does not a flight sim make wouldnt even call something like ace combat a flight sim those sorts of games are just arcadey fun neither the flight model nor the means of controlling the aircraft are achieved in a way anywhere close to real life    thats what it means to be a flight sim a simulation of what its actually like to fly in a cessna a boeing 747 etc    that all being said the afterburner series is for sure great
are we fighting then crimson skies is the only true flight simulator because it had planes and was fun check out this incredibly logical airframe right here vidya is about realism gentlemen
     afterburner is an f14
  not sure if you didnt read my whole post or autism the pic was from crimson skies it was a joke post because anons are arguing about arcadey vs super realistic flight games unless youre training for a real mission it isnt worth sperging about definitions particularly since theres a lack of clear terms of sub genres which are popularly used in this segment
  crimson skies is not a flight simulator
  right above ya bro  
  a flying airplane isnt a flight simulator go back underage
  full blast  lol full blast
  because anons are arguing about arcadey vs super realistic flight games     theres no arguing or sperging arcade shooters and flight sims are completely different genres it just very sadly had to be explained to op
  ab3 simulates flight because you are inside an aeroplane flying
  at this point its hard to tell if this is trolling or if youre genuinely retarded
  whats the problem with that airframe it has wings and a powerful engine to sustain flight it even has various people to better coordinate the different aspects of a combat mission
  anon fuck you and go play janes sims or fleet defender then you come back here
  not only that the wings are foiled
  air foil
  janes sims  how are those games any good
  they are awesome
  after burner for the sega system has a great song
  thats why this thread
yes yes also choplifter is the best chopping simulator amiriteguise
  wrong  its the best lifting simulator
  did you know that elevator action is in fact the best lift simulator
  lift simulator  lol lift simulator
  ps2 is retro because its almost 20 years old
afterburner 3 is a fun flight sim
  flight sim  it is not
  they are hard and niche simulators they have folding cardboard for default keyboard bindings they have very thick manuals explaining from flight theory to a very detailed explanation of controls mfds and the operation of your aircraft to a brief description of the enemy aircraft youre going to face  if you just want to blow things up its quite a far stride from that but if you want the as real as it gets experience they are unmatched
  sounds like crap
  different games for different people i used to play the hell out of ms flight simulator i like games like space harrier too shooting shit is always fun but actually feeling like youre flying a plane is awesome
  i would like to pour some gas on the flight simulator argument    ace combat is definitely the best flight sim and if you argue against that youre retarded just look at this mission in vid related  
  i adore ace combat but those fucking tunnel flights give me a heart attack every time
  just get fighters anthology since its like a combination of around 4 different games and will actually workthose games generally wont run on anything newer than win98 most of the time or not without a ton of bullshit but fa works fine and im on 32bit vista
  32bit vista  lol
  isnt that like for cd
  cd  yes like sega cd
  sega cd  lol sega cd
sturmovik  all this gay shit
  underage made several shitposts  true
posting in a bitch thread
why did it fail there has to be some behind the scenes drama its a super polished action game one of the best for the snes and why a pornstar for a cute kids game     none of it adds up     
ive seen this thread a million times beforetheres not much to say about it
    but why did it flop whats the backstory on the game so many questions
  its a super polished action game  i wouldnt go that far its alright but to be honest the controls and level design could do with a lot more polish    coz it wasnt that good
  what are you even talking about is there some conspiracy behind this game  the super famicom is chock full of these cutesy colorful action platformers
definitely a hidden gem and the ost is great cant tell you anything else
what is this game and why should i play it
  its mega man zero if zero were a cute anime girl
packinvideo released too few copies of the game thats all in fact they didnt have a real hit until harvest moon later
    yeah it must have been super tiny amount considering how much the game goes for now i think magical popn should have gotten a ps/saturn rerelease proably not enough interest for an american release but im sure the jp fans would have liked it     ive been checking through americaneuro gaming mags frmo the era to find more info on the game and nothing mentions it normally a lot of games even jp only ones get a preview or some news but nothing that implies that there wasnt that much promotion of it either
its babbies first hidden gem but its such a good and fun game regardless
  its cute but its like a 7/10 at best it was a japan only release relatively short and didnt have much advertisement     honestly the game just kind of makes me sad the woman who provided the voice for the main character had a miserable life that ended in a miserable way i feel sad for her and always think of her when i see the game now
  relatively short    yet everyone jerks off about mega man games
zero magazines covered it i presume some jp mags did     its not that its jp only western mags covered those games all the time especially in prviews here is ys v for instance
pornstar    what
  mega man has far more replay value
    only for speedrunners or something
  and why a pornstar for a cute kids game  not until recently japan has been really lax about including av adult video actresses in things meant for children  in the tokusatsu henshin hero tv genre you had av actresses have regular roles on super hero shows like super sentai and kamen rider those were shows watched by kids but mom and dad werent too far away handsome actors were for mom and sultry av actresses or gravure stars were for dad having an av actress doing voice over in a video game is not strange because that is a draw for men who are fans of her within the last few years the practice has wane because of the existence of the internet kids can now find out more on these women and down the rabbit hole they go
  i dont see why its a big deal as long as she does her job properly why is it doing porn in the west has to be a fucking carreer death sentence and somehow japan is supposed to be the highly repressed country
  aids awareness activism  died of pneumonia    sad
    you implying she died of aids
  probably she was sexually active during the right time frame hiv incidence is low in japan but not unheard of pneumonia could also be code for suicide or drugrelated death but assuming it was just pneumonia the likelihood of it being lethal to someone that young is low unless your immune system is shot i dont know what kind of aids drugs are available in japan people here in the us can live pretty normal lives now
  eh some strains of pneumonia can be quite deadly if not treated in time and were talking about japan a country where some people die from the common cold  but yeah aids  pneumonia is quite the red flag
  japanese are prone to hyperobsession  the last thing you want is kids getting over to porn too soon becoming obsessed with some av actress and neglecting life and what not  it was different before because the japanese adult industry made it next to impossible to buy x rated shit the old fashion way the internet made it easier  the west doesnt like the idea of porn stars crossing over for similar reasons  you normalize porn stars in tv and movies then boys discover porn too soon and some think it glamorizes porn for girls thus they try to follow suit for fame  youre condoning the biggest legalized prostitution ring in the world   most jav actresses dont like what they do and dont try to pretend they do either while western porn stars play it up as something good until theyre no longer wanted then they end up on some talk show blasting it
  bbbbut think of the children
    sports nippon had reported that ai iijima was suffering from hay fever pyelitis ascending urinary tract infection that has reached the pyelum pelvis of the kidney cystitis and acute backache she had written in her blog that she had kidney problems and inflammation of the urinary tract and bladder  if it were aids wed never know  japanese women are susceptible to sicknesses like cancer organ failure and more  while some women in other countries an bounce back japanese women can be pretty frail especially when theyre aged  and in japan if the family doesnt want to announce the cause of death they wont if the person has pr or an agency they might cook up a common cause of death and release that wikipedia mention the police but they too can be bought off or asked by family to say something else
  anon you kind of have to  a child lack critical thinking self control and can build bad habits that last a life time  in one of the most safe places on earth to raise a child you think of the children so they dont grow up complete invalids
  that is bullshit i found out about porn at age 11 and now im a successful adult shitposting 12 hours a day about a dead porn actress on a forum about cartoons
  hotdog youre a winner son
  name 3 please  i stumbled upon this in a collectorfag thread and wanted to know why it was worth so much money it was really fun and i played it on my sd2snes it took me two sittings to beat it it doesnt have a lot of replay value though and it doesnt have a save feature but it is a really good game especially compared to a lot of trash we got in north america that i still bought and played and beat
  its a super polished action game  its barely above average nothing special
  this    what
  but why did it flop  probably because as he said theres not much to say about it combine that with its not that good of a game and you have your answer
      not a good game  barely above average    id love to see what 2d action games you guys consider actually good
  its the 90s anon if a game fails its due to bad advertising its as simple as that
     stuff thats not on super famicom perhaps
honestly looking at gameplay of it it reminds me of most platforming games on the gba  i will say its a decade ahead of its time due to how polished it is but thats pretty much it  overall it probably just got lost in the messload of platforming games in the 90s
  bull
    i guarantee they didnt print enough and didnt have an advertisement budget and none of the americaneuro mags ive read mention it being at any of the big gaming shows in japan         and since most of those games werent that good magical popn has shined through way more memorable
  honestly its not just advertisement but its primarily due to the period it came out in social norms in the western world were vastly different and it having a female protagonist wouldve easily disregarded this game as for girls moe wasnt even a known term yet and anime in general wasnt a household name until around 1997    on top of being shunned on how it looks gameplay from games that came from japan wasnt as huge of a factor back then unless said games were massively funded by nintendo sega konami etc in fact theres plenty of well made sega genesis games that were left in the dust due to lack of advertising    yeah it sucks when created games like this remain obscure but sometimes thats just how it goes
  its a sidescrolling 2d cutesy/kiddy game released on a system with a wide plethora of games that also fit that description during a console generation where they more or less dominated the market and was japan only to boot  dont worry though its a great game and probably has a huge amount of youtubers who will call it a hidden gem thus increasing demand and making physical copies grow in price
wait who is the porn star
  wait who is the porn star    your mom

  kirby 3  doremi fantasy  plok  goemon    threw an extra game in for you
  i stumbled upon this in a collectorfag thread and wanted to know why it was worth so much money    primarily its rarity likely only a few tens of thousands of copies ever released
i put magical popn in my top 5 snes side scrolling action games    hagane  demons crest  magical popn   kaizou choujin schbibinman zero  mega man x
  plok  what is this meme i always see i played it several times and did not have fun    doremi fantasy  this is a great game but not as good as magical popn in my opinion both were a lot of fun
the voice acting in magical popn is terrible not only is the acting really bad but the recording quality is terrible and its mixed poorly its ten times louder than the other audio what a mess
    of course the sound quality wont be great since its a snes makes me wonder why they didnt go for pcecd or saturn/ps cd audio and voiced cut scenes could have helped a lot
  the best games are the most wellknown ones talent makes itself known    there are no hidden gems that are above an 8/10
  the best games are the most wellknown ones  pleb opinion its not entirely wrong but it implies lower sales  lower quality which is still wrong
  on the snes you have stuff like valken hagane contra 3 ninja warriors again super gng sunset riders castlevania wild guns actraiser some shmups etc those are great action games in my book
    magical popn is as good or better than those games
  shut up pedo
  if you have a fetish for dead jav actress sure otherwise cookiecutter platformer
  cookiecutter platformer    up stab downstab slide crawling whole list of spells and subweapons the moveset is a mix of the gbands metroidvanais meets zelda ii controls are tight maze levels focusing on exploration graphics on point with highly detailed sprites and a huge array of smooth animations     cookie cutter please its one of the better snes games period few games are this polished
  why did it fail  it didnt    not every game has to become a franchise
  yeah too bad most are irrelevant and plays like a cookiecutter platformer in the end  maze levels focusing on exploration  this is cancer for an action game
  oh youre one of those simpletons too dumb to wrap their brain around mazes carry on
  no you fucking retard the point was that there are much better action games on the systems mazes are completely irrelevant as they dont make a good action game
  this is cancer for an action game    good thing its an actionexploration game a protometroidvania
  oh so its part of an inferior genre okay then
      exploration is fun
  but its not some brain dead shmup that you play on memorization its a tansaku scotformer or 探索 プラットフォーム
considering how hard op is defending this average game i think all the million threads we had before about this game were made by him as well like the ff8 aspergers guy
  the board scope is limited to products from before 1999 its only natural that topics might repeat
    nice one op youre brainded defense of this bland game is pathetic
  memorization is the most important skill in video games if you hate it you may be the one braindead here  and your mediocre game is too basic in exploration and too halfassed in action to be any fun
  memorization skills are completely trivialized by savestates you fail it
  savestates trivialize your brain you might as well watch some lets play for that you zoomer shitter
  yeh maybe five years ago but femenist women now are the most fucked in the head retards with cognitive dissonance protruding from their roastie roast beef meat curtains
  sex workers are shunned because most people dont want people with loose morals and looser pussies around pretending its anything other than that is as stupid as pretending youre not a dude
any game with an up/downstab is 10/10 for me
how was the game received in japan anyone know of any reviews
  rather how hard youre attacking the game
  video games
    the best games are the most wellknown ones talent makes itself known    a game can not be released or have a big ad campaign but still be great it could be business troubles or problems things like thator the game came out late for the system and they didnt think it worth it to localize it thats the case with magical popn     there are no hidden gems that are above an 8/10    i can think of a few    magical popn  the adventures of little ralph  harmful park
thats easy youre thinking too deep
imagine seething this much that popn is miles superior to your shitty basic games that you need to intentionally act like an autistic sperglord just to try and shit on it and get shutdown every time in the process
    wheres taht from
does she wield a sword or a wand never got that
anyone know what this says
  on this note if you want mega man but mega man and zero are cute anime girls play rosenkreuzstilette
  meanwhile there are two kinds of professional illustrators in japan those that did porn and fucking liars
  there is a reason why so many smut artists in japan use pseudonyms  voice actors too
  look at the credits for an old japanese game everyone used aliases
  that was enforced by their respective companies to prevent scalping talent and employees going rouge staking their claim in making a game  its not the same as doing voice work on a yaoi anime and not wanting that to be discovered when you make it to main stream voice acting
  it was because videogames were seen as childish and not really for an adult audience
magical popn  popn magic  popn tanks    why so many popn games in japan and why did they all die off
    i think poppun just means bursting with fun and energy
  why not megamari i honestly prefered it to rozen
  why not megamari    i dont like fan games
  me love u long time
  and you like rozen with ocdonutsteel level shit story and character designs i know the game itself is pretty good but hell if megamari at least is more bearable despite being touhou
      whats with the zoom in the gif
magical fapn
    the worst is the blatantly traced sprites     
  not an excuse children can develop warped sexuality through pornography
but the game is good why isnt it popular  what retarded logic is this theres fucking tons of great games that never became popular even in the super famicom case alone you just need to look at umihara kawase being good doesnt necessarily equate with being popular with the general crowd everyone should know this by now
  traps are gay
  therere also other factors such as marketing pricing and trends most of all etc
  探索 プラットフォーム    ha youre trying to be clever they actually call it a popnvania over there
    yeah its mostly because it was released so late in the sfcs lifescycle
what about the popn music games  arent they set in the same universe as magical popn  do they ever reference each other or have any shared lore
magical popn    more like magical poopn what a shitload of fuck
    popn music is a sideseries in the popnvania series it focuses on music while most of them are platformers theres also popn magic a pcecd puzzle game
question im doing a project involving some very long game boy link cables 1015 feet and im getting a lot of signal failure im curious since im using cheapo chinese cables spliced together at length could i be suffering signal loss due to the length of the cable or to maybe a poor amount of shielding on the cable assuming the shielding built in could be poor/nonexistent     im really not too knowledgeable about signal loss and am trying to figure out why im having problems with a longdistance connection failure on game boy cables     if any ee anons can help me out then id appreciate it
    seriously check out /ohm/ its probably lenth of the cable if you know your connections are good did you test the cables before you spliced them to make sure they actually worked
  yeah i got a closed circuit on the expected pins unfortunately im traveling now and dont have my multimeter handy     i did make a post on /ohm/ but didnt get a response maybe ill try again
  since im using cheapo chinese cables spliced together at length  but why
can you post pictures of your handiwork
  not right now sorry      i didnt want to destroy genuine cables and the chinese pump these cheapo clones like theyre going out of style so i felt that it supported my needs
  1015 feet and im getting a lot of signal failure  im using cheapo chinese cables spliced together at length  its 335v voltage drop gets bigger the smaller voltage you are running i got a battery setup in my van that uses 12v and i had to be careful with wire sizing to avoid getting voltage drop of 510 on some runs how small do you imagine the 6 wires inside a link cable are 20awg if so then at 15 feet you are already looking at 3 voltage drop at 5v and 46 voltage drop at 33v god help you if the wires are thinner than that 3 is considered an issue 10 is considered unusable by any electronic device    save the ends get bigger wire better yet see if you can find some readytosolder connectors to use  this isnt 120v ac where you can go 50100 feet with an extension cable and not have to worry too much about shit not working
  thank you i think this is the shred of knowledge that i was looking for but didnt know how exactly to find and google wasnt helping much    i think im going to have to do as you suggest the distances wont play nicely with this setup asis thanks for the insight i appreciate your help
  pretty much this id trim the plastic coating on the connectors and use decent wire if possible test the resistance of the wire or even better pop a few batteries on one end test the voltage on both ends    i recently purchased a cigarette lighter cable but the wire it came with was so thin i was only able to get around 700ma out of it and even then it ran warm i changed to thicker cable and can now draw the full 3a it needed
      also you could make a signal booster box if you wanted to run really long cable
  signal failure  cables spliced together  im really not too knowledgeable  this shit again
  what is your project why do you need such long cables
  probably some multigameboy lsdj shit
kirby 64 has held up pretty well graphically im suprised that they were able to get kirby looking like a perfect circle and the cutscenes are very well animated
  may have been the last good kirby game i never played the wii kirby though
the two best n64 games     starfox 64  and  super smash bros
  wii kirby is actually really well made i say that as a huge fan of superstar and kirby 64    smash bros has aged well dkc is decent but might be hard on the eyes    bomberman hero has a lot of slowdown/low frame rate but after you play it for ten minutes you get adjusted and it looks fine    paper mario is probably the best looking game on the system and still holds up against ttyd and some modern games      what do you guys think are the worst looking games on the n64
  most 3d fps look like complete dogshit or run like complete dogshit or both such as turok armorines diakatana quake 1 quake 2 etc  i think superman 64 looks like shit especially char model and animations  paperboy 64 looks fucking terrible  one could argue that fzero x looks bad but honestly i dont mind the lowpoly models and emptyish backgrounds because the art style / direction looks fine and it was intentionally scaled back in graphics so it would run at 60fps constant and it fucking does and its worth it   body harvest look awfulshitty blur  the worst thing about n64 is that the games that have the best graphics run the worst like perfect dark goldeneye majoras mask etc  earthworm jim 3d looks a lot worse than the first 2 games  razer freestyle scooter maybe  blues brothers 2000  bubsy 3d   carmageddon 64    personally id say castlevania 64 looked bad but i guess not too bad for the time  most unplayable for me is diakatana it runs at 12 frames per second yes twelve
  all of them games dont age
  most 3d fps look like complete dogshit or run like complete dogshit or both such as turok armorines diakatana quake 1 quake 2 etc  turok 1 looks good other than the fog and runs smooth  quake 2 looks good on n64 particularly with the expansion pak except for the uninterpolated animations and is reasonably smooth    the worst thing about n64 is that the games that have the best graphics run the worst like perfect dark goldeneye majoras mask etc  play world driver championship
  while this is true that doesnt mean they werent shit to begin with what most people think when they say age is how the game is shit compared to todays standards as in how much better it would be if it were made today  3d games age poorly visually because you cant scale them to higher resolutions without introducing blur unless you use custom shaders and because they looked bad before some 3d games dont really have issues here and look fine anyways 2d games dont have this issue for example smb looks good  mechanically controls menus ui saves/lives and general experience these are most important and have greatly improved over time for example crash 1 had a terrible save system rayman 1 had a terrible continue system    tldr an aged game didnt age it was bad to begin with except you didnt have anything better
mario golf  mario 64  starfox 64  shiren 2  smash bros  ocarina  majora  the first 5 levels of banjo    this is an exhaustive list of all things worth playing on the n64
the best game on the system of course 
mischief makers  one of the few games that you can play and not think that it is being held back by n64 hardware but it has pretty weird controls  back in the day i considered it ok and its still what i think it is
  yo bro you posted the wrong picture
  not the sequel  lad
  more like the crystal sharts amirite
  mischief makers is an amazing game does it emulate well at all i tried some years ago and it emulated terribly what a classic though i wish more games were like it
  this is the only legitimately good rpg in the entire n64 library unless you really want to call hybrid heaven good i have no idea why they didnt use the tactics ogre name though
  all kirby games have been good so far dumbass
  this is the only legitimately good rpg in the entire n64 library  what about pooper mario    i have no idea why they didnt use the tactics ogre name though  to games have different gameplay than ogre battle also to was a spinoff to ob
just ran through both of these which do you think is better i think im leaning more toward 2
2 by far
2 is a better game but i really do prefer 1 i like the character designs and world more it feels more lighthearted and fun theyre both very charming and enjoyable games though absolutely classics and pinnacles of the console and both are worth playing
  gameplay of 2 story of 1     i wish 2 would have lost the explore parts to be honest and just be more linear like 1 its mostly linear but sometimes you revisit areas and trigger semi random battles you can avoid them if you dont step on certain tiles
  best girl incoming
  it didnt have a fairly big map desu and yeah while that happened it was useful to me the first time earlier on for a bit of grinding and then later on anytime it happened was hardly a hassle since i was much stronger than the enemies anyway a quick slaughtering hardly a nuisance during my playthrough
  since you used the mega drive picture is the pal version fine to play in 60hz or is it partially optimised i dont want to buy the genesis version because of actiplaque
  it feels more lighthearted and fun  thats a curious opinion personally i think 1 is noticibly the darker of the two in both story and visuals
  its been optimised the music plays at the correct speed at 50hz and i believe the gameplay does too
2 for the most part but 1 had that awesome laser cannon boss fight
    doesnt 2 have a laser fight as well on a bridge
  i dont recall a laser bridge fight in 2 there is one boss that comes to mind but thats a minor spoiler
  no there were the prism flowers that could shoot lasers along the entire map and were used in a cutscene too but they were not on a bridge
  all 3 master monks are best girls
  master monk karna is pointless desu sarah works great as a master monk because of her stats and the lack of strong magic
  two is objectively better it is larger and feels more epic due to the exploration parts has a couple of more creative battles mithril weapons arguably a bit of a more elaborate story    where the first part wins is in the atmosphere and art style department i like the darker tones much more than the comic style    i love these games to death but my one complaint would be that they are too easy
  2 is objectively the better game  i liked 1s story/characters/etc more  both are masterpiece tier  also you should play shining in the darkness since youre playing genesis titles
  also you should play shining in the darkness since youre playing genesis titles  do tell
  shining force except its a first person dungeon crawler its fucking good takes place before shining force 1 doesnt get a sequel in similar style until shining the holy ark  which is on the saturn
  just ran through both of these which do you think is better  finished sf1 earlier this year and currently in the middleor near the endish of sf2 love both and sf2 definitely smoothed some things out but despite being inferior in some ways i find sf1 better so far      but 1 had that awesome laser cannon boss fight  so far my favorite battle from either game also loved the circus tentdat music fight
  i honestly cant say i love both in their own ways
  2 is better overall but the grittiness of 1 is better    dont forget about sfcd sf gaiden final conflict translation patched sf soh on game gear also sf3 with translation patches you have a ways to go op
anyone got fanart of the cute boys from these games
i think sf1 is far better because sf2 is terrible seems like they prioritized quantity over quality in the second game as the battles were boring and uninspired even without considering the random battles which are the worst filler ever the second game also had awful writing losing the charm of sf1 and the free exploration aspect was a detriment because the locations and characters were so forgettable sf2 did nothing to fix the slowness and balance issues with the gameplay either and in fact id say it made the problems worse sf2 is the low point of the series in my opinion
  yogurt  kiwi
  1 is better balanced and more challenging but 2 has superior music production quality and visuals
  camelot never gave a fuck about writing beyond the bare minimum its only a few steps above saga in how the story takes a back seat
  interesting ill check it out
  theres a bare minimum level of writing where you ignore it and it doesnt bother you and then theres things like sf2 which are painful to experience  and while i dont think sf3 is as great as other people say it is theres clearly a substantial amount of story there so i dont think what you say is true
  im sorry but ill take my young inexperienced but plucky elf fire mage any day
  tao
  kazin was better in every way however i was so annoyed when i promoted him to sorcerer and he got this awful drag queen costume
not best girling one of the centaur girls    plebs
        fags all of you
/vr/ im in a pickle i started my game of shining force 2 and got to the chess board fight but heres the thing the difficultys the actual hardest difficulty and i dont think i enjoy it very much what do i do do i toughen up and face the challenge or restart my game
  i played it on normal mode but the method i used to win was to stay to the side and bait as many enemies as i could out to take out as few as possible at a time before going straight for the king and ending it quick
  the chess board is just a really difficult battle the differences in difficulty arent all that big a deal bait them out and use the opportunity to level up
  sega cd one is best
  youre the one best girling a half horse     best girl right here shame you get her so late in the game
two might be better on some technical levels but one is the more refined allaround experience in my book
  if youre playing on ouch then iirc the enemies wont break formation until the exact moment someone comes into range and they can move first so you have to bait them by moving into the range of only specific enemies and drawing them out one or two at a time without putting your main force at risk of a full onslaught
  the chess board is the most difficult battle of the game you just dont have good ways to deal with everything that fight has there grind it going for the king to win the next fight will show you that you are in a that time of the game      and that all prepromotes on a secret class are designed to be the worst member you can have on that class
  i enjoyed 1 more than 2 second game had better mechanics but i couldnt get into it like i did with 1 first game just had a better story and characters
        ok i got past the chess fight ill keep going and be smart with my tactics thank you
while i enjoy both i have to say 1 is better in every way sans the soundtrack 2 drags on stats on levels arent nearly random enough and lack the spikes 1 has and as a result characters a really interchangeable few really standout in the ass kicking department also it has far to many random/pointless battles
  this    twp is not a bad game its just not as tight of an experience part one also has exceptional worldbuilding where each town feels extremely unique and is fun to explore
  people who live in glass houses shouldnt waifu stones       all prepromotes on a secret class are designed to be the worst  say what rohde jaro and lemon are all plenty serviceable
on wednesday im going somewhere on a train and it will take me about 3 hours on thursday im taking a trip with the same length i decided to take a psp with me and finish a game on an emulator so i come to you with a question  what retro game would be good for such a trip i want to be able to finish it in these 6hrs so it will take up my whole trip suggestions
mgs
smw takes roughly around 6 hours to beat assuming you try to 100 it
  banjo kazooie
  your psps battery probably cant survive this just read a fucking book
  thats what my friends been sugesting i thought about it but wanted to get some more recs also    was thinking more 2d    thatd be awesome but n64 emulation on my psp chugs dick    chug dick  i would but i hate reading on trains  also you know i can charge it during the trip right
  how about one of the medievils
  famicom tantei club part ii for snes with an english translation patch
  depends on the system but for long days of comfy gaming i go to  nes  mega man series smb series ff1 for some soothing grinds kirbys adventure maniac mansion  snes  mmx/mm7 mario kart zombies ate my neighbors  genesis  sonic games road rash scooby doo mystery  gameboy/gbc  mario land 2 pokemon links awakening dx donkey kong land games mega man   gba  gunstar super heroes sigma star saga fzero mario advance games
i dont know how good the psps genesis emulation is but id say try beyond oasis its a great and very short action rpg
  my mom is letting me take the train alone
itt games no one has played except you
i swear i have a better chance of winning the lottery than meeting somebody who has played this
especially hard to find people who played this outside of brazil
  i wish this series was still alive
based galaxy of games shareware complation cds
  ive played it its like an early proto concept for twin stick shooters but in super quick bursts the amen break is pretty sick when you finish a round
  i played this it was from some shareware disc if i remember correctly
  yeah it was from a company called egames they made and produced a lot of cool stuff for pc  like crazy drake an earthworm jim ripoff for example  the full speedy eggbert games were also around a few supermarkets in são paulo during early 2000s
  no one had played  youtube fodder    youre different just like everyone else
    avgn will probably make a video about it at some point
    shit yeah i played this at my grandpas house when i was like 10 and i sucked ass at it and got very frustrated because that little shit was not speedy at all    i was used to playing snes sonic when i thought of the word speedy that shit fucked me up
  its from the other timeline before the split  also pretty sure nobody else has played pic related found as a 5 floppy in a used pc store as a kid and spent countless hours clearing klingons out of federation space
  played the hell out of this and the sequel as a kid did anyone ever get the multiplayer to work
  no more crazy off the wall fighting games because everything has to be competitive for the bullshit tournament crowd     i hope you faggots enjoy your negan shit
played this on the genesis  its an unofficial release and it also happens to suck ass
    that is an impressive manual though
  well thats because its the same thing split into like 5 languages
  duuuuuuuude literally fucked this game 14 years ago probably wont ever play it ever again
  literally fucked this game
    good games    the strategy game was fun    newfags cant know this love for /vr/ gaming
  galaxy of games  which disks did you have
  literally fucked this game
  1 and 2 i remember also having the exile trilogy of rpgs earthworm jim for windows castle of the winds micro man 12 chips challenge
  i played it way back when what a shitty game
  that game waa creepy as fuck and the sound when you bark against a skater and he gets scared
really love this game i just wish the other game got an english version
  pretty sure accolade/ballistic was officially licenced to publish for sega they just manufactured their own carts like ea did it wasnt like with tengen and camerica on the nes
next we have dracs night out on the nes now this game was never released so what im holding is a rare reproduction cartridge which is the only way it can be played    what did james mean by this
  i dont know who james is but i assume he means there arent any ripped roms of it
  so what im holding is a rare rare bootleg cart that any chinese scumbag site can make up for you for a couple of dollars
is rayman 2 dare i say the best retro 3d scotformer
thats a 3dbeltscrollerscotfomertansakuwillyvania where i can get the dosrom tho
  i thought it was a spyrovania
its quite boring designwise and the art design is a bit too involving the soundtrack is nice though
the fuck is a scotformer
compared to 
  i think he meant mascot platformer
  a forced meme
    its somewhere between a mariovania and a spyroformer
imagine replying to this ironic thread with ironic replies when ultimately both of these things are extremely retarded not funny poorly thought old reddittier and so on
looking good
the master system version stomps all over the nintendo one
  nah  its a good game though
  not even close
  ill be honest this is the first ive heard of a ninja gaiden game on sms how does it compare
when you lose against the jaquio and it pushes you back 3 levels is kind of bullshit
  its not really that bad his first phase is completely free youll probably get shit on by his 2nd phase a few times but if you enter with the correct subweapon its not hard same goes for third phase
australiakun
i bought this today anyone wanna play online
  no
  i would have anon but i dont have my dreampi built yet
for me its everquest
  me too friend me too  
when the did the for me its x thing start
is this game still good if i dont have friends to play with ive never played eq but ive heard it has like over 1000 pve areas which is pretty enticing
  blame /ck/
  90 of the game is fighting one goblin or kobold at a time
am i suppoosed to play regular eq or the p99 thing
  yeah man youll easily make friends especially as you are forced to group as you level unless you pick one of those antisocial classes     not sure why you say that what type of bad groups have you been in    p99 is much comfier and harder
really enjoyable game but everything takes forever you can easily lose a quarter or half of a day and not get much done i actually wouldnt change the game at all but i just cant sink the time in anymore
  this is actually pretty true later in the game which is why its good to make friends that are always down to do something
  yeah i love p99  came back as a necro main and a monk twink i play chars until about 50s and then want the freshness of the early level game in different areas that i had never seen on live its a surprisingly huge game and incredibly difficult on p99 just like the old days
the virgin everquest  the chad asherons call
  based
  asherons call    checks out gameplay videos  looks like fucking shit gonna try out p99
  what race/class
  play a druid or wiz and solo 4 kobolds at a time
  soloing kobolds
was gona finish my epic piece today after having the quest items ready for more than a year but my daughter seem to have ruined my mouse so i cant do it  i play on project 1999 really nice population  i hope more people join in the fun without new people i think player base would dwindle but there seems to be a great flow of both returning players and new ones filling the ranks
  quickest way 18 is in steamfont getting druid shield regen and damage shield from visiting druids just pulling all the kobold camps letting them ds themselves out
  well yeah obviously with strong buffs you can fight things way stronger than you and level like crazy i liked buffing in newbie zones i was passing through as a druid
  although another time in the ec tunnel i charmed a lion and dueled a newbie i told the guy i wouldnt use any spells on him and let the lion do all the fighting then i buffed the hell out of the lion and watched the show
for me too shame i rolled a warrior as a first character i know they are guaranteed a spot in raids later but holy shit dude i am playing a druid right now and the game seems much easier with binds camouflages and the gate i have also i do much more damage without having good gear at all i got my 14 druid to kurns and the journey to kunark wouldve been impossible if i was a warrior even though my war is 27 and has a crusty set btw kurns is fucking sick
  eq is balanced like that a warrior lacks the all round skills of a druid to get around and is gear dependent but hes got an indispensable role in raids once hes set it may not be the best class to get to know the game perhaps druid is better and for making frens along as well
  i really liked the thrill of going through dagnors and lfay on my warrior not gonna lie the thrill is still there with my druid but its kinda gone when i can invis myself against everything cept undead and certain mobs can bind myself at the entrance have a sow at my disposal and a root if things are looking grim i know warriors are top tier raiders but i dunno if its worth it levelling a warrior at all since the scene is dead on p99 so ive heard good part about levelling a warrior is how durable i seem even at 27 compared to others rogues and casters take several hits without getting heals and they are dropped to 6070 max hp while i can juat turn off my brain and tank everything as long as its not an overpull i may play him more since mistmoore is always so populated and i really like it and want to explore it kurns is also cool and the xp for my druid is mental though i think i got to 1516 in just over an hour i really wish i levelled in kurns with some lizardbros on my warrior instead of soulessly grinding sashes but how was i supposed to dodge the drolvargs and the iksar who are highly agressive and con red at mid teens besides if i die in kurns its a fucking gg i dont know where is tge the closest bind point to kurns for noniksar even
  if she is supposed to be a paladin why does she look like a mage
  you would have been ported in through emerald jungle gotten a bind outside of kaesora and boom kurns you go
  dont be racist
  worst games ever made thread
  my corpse rotted at the bottom of an ocean
bbump
  almost happened once right after kunark released i was swimming around timorous deep exploring and got eaten by a dragon in the middle of the ocean luckily i was able to find it by exploiting that bug that seemed to affect all games prior to the advent of shaders  positioning the camera right at water level allowing you to see through the water as if it were air
  and i think the game didnt consider zaxis when dragging your corpse which made it easier
  best place for a level 18 necromancer in antonica
  never played it  is this shit good  which are the more solo classes up in this shit
  play on p99 man friends are something that just happen to you there
that loading screen song then the sound you make when spawning take me back to east commons when life was simple
    so much this i still cant believe how nice people are on p99 maybe it has to do with people being more mature there plus being based boomersnot kidding a lot of people left my groups because of their kids and stuff like that its kinda strange for a 18 year old virgin nerd like me that has so much disposable time lulz
  this is a 30 boomer game because most adhd kids these days do not have the patience and dedication required to play
  there is no such thing as a 30 boomer faggot imagine someone over 30 using memes created by children
  can you imagine how many nerds blew a load for her
  well deserved imo firiona is the true sex symbol of pc gaming of her time
      p99 is fun from 159 but the raiding scene is just pure ass cancer
  shes an enchanter they just gave her armor in newer versions for no reason
  it considered it iirc it just teleported it to you and dropped it everytime you summoned it
  i absolutely agree people are nice on p99 than the amount of free stuff and buffs i have thrown at me just for looking like a noob
i have a newbie question on p99 it says there are about 500 people online so i get into the server but using one of the most common classes there isnt a single person near me im just in the starting area but really where is everyone just spread out all over far away from me its hard to believe theres not a single other newbie near me is there any way to see where the most players are in the server without needing to go to that region and doing /who to see how many players are nearby
  most people hang out wherever the trading action is since its an excuse to congregate and sit around bullshitting when theyre bored  in classic that was basically the ec tunnels and kelethin  i think p99 is up to velious so im not sure where it would be if theyre hanging out on that continent but ec and kelethin should be at least relatively easy to get to by eq standards anyway  bear in mind that you can just make a throwaway toon starting in freeport rq to check pretty easily
  you can get some idea using /who all which will return a partial list of all players in all zones
  the chad asherons call  playing darktide as a life mage was some fun times
i started playing in 2016 i have a megaboner for that old 3d aesthetic     literally one of the comfiest games ive ever fucking played
  which starting area were you in some areas were less populated on live and of course its the same on p99 with a lower total population count theres always someone in greater faydark however
  you will never again go on a perilous journey with your level 6 erudite mage from erudin across the world to kelethen to run that repeatable crushbond quest with your buddies    because there were no maps other than poorly made fan maps on obscure sites and loading between zones took 5 mins  22 minute boat ride it turned into a harrowing nightlong journey across the world including one nice level 40 wizzard who eventually ported me to the commonlands so i didnt have to try to get through high pass    goddamn that first night on eq got me hooked on mmos it really felt like i have gone on a journey by the time i got all the way to kelethin    nothing will ever beat those feels kids today can never understand
  you picked the dwarfs didnt you its always a ghost townkaladim only seems empty the surrounding mountains are jam packed with players
  first character was an iksar decided i wanted to play with my brother in qeynos travel there using literal road signs from the karanas didnt know about binding man that was a really bad time
  for me its the mcchicken the best fast food sandwich i even ask for extra mcchicken sauce packets and the staff is so friendly and more than willing to oblige    one time i asked for mcchicken sauce packets and they gave me three i said wow three for free and the nice friendly mcdonalds worker laughed and said im going to call you 3forfree    now the staff greets me with hey its 3forfree and always give me three packets its such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local mcdonalds restaurant i go there at least 3 times a week for lunch and a large iced coffee with milk instead of cream 12 times for breakfast on the weekend and maybe once for dinner when im in a rush but want a great meal that is affordable fast and can match my daily nutritional needs    i even dip my fries in mcchicken sauce its delicious what a great restaurant
  welcome to eq weve all been there i didnt know you could get your corpse back before i was lvl 10 or so
  rough as a child but man there were so many fond memories
make char on p99  grind solo to level 5 in gfay  never see a single lfg or lfm call  check out orc hill  one excessively twinked guy getting blatantly pled by his own alt  head into cb  a couple more massive twinks with bots on autofollow    server is shit good luck doing anything there at this point without paying real life money
  perhaps the server population has gone down i leveled up in gfay last year and it seemed ok there were orc hill groups as was as groups in crushbone later on
  even 10 years into the servers lifespan this isnt representative of the typical experience always groups of shitter noobs at orc hill and in cb i played tonight and there were 22 appropriately leveled ppl in cb and none i saw were twinked above a couple hp rings or a sword from com or whatever expect to bribe and hustle if you want to do all the raid targets but you are full of shit otherwise
      those twinks dont mind grouping either usually
  perhaps its a good idea to bring or make some friends that are on the same schedule on classic friends for life were made on orc hill good times
  ok that explains alot
this things fuckin cool
  it has the goat analog stick
  the analog stick feel as good as a female nipple
  it was actually better than the dreamcast controller what the fuck
    hall effect ftmfw
  it wasnt dc has better analog and feels better in hands
  i disagree
  ah so thats why i violently bit it off while screaming mommy
  so young youre still breast feeding i guess
  its real  wew
   of sand
  maybe in dog years
  the analog and feel is on par but it shits the bed with only four face buttons
what makes ps1 game scripts different i cant put my finger on it modern games are more cinematic for sure but games like xenogears and bof4 have a way of bringing npcs to life with just a little bit of dialogue whats the secret
  they had to cover with good writings what they couldnt cover with the graphic / animations
  but whats the secret
rpgs benefit from having no voice acting  soul reaver and mgs were great even though they had voice acting
  theres a secret file they open and put different text into for each game once they do that the game displays different stuff technology is fucking amazing
  vidya writing is really just riffing off the anime writing of their time the ps1 coincided with neon genesis evangelion super obvious when looking at xenogears which raised the bar by a mile
  bof4 is a masterpiece i have no idea how you got xenogears jumbled up with it though most of the writing in most ps1 games was shitty
xenogears script written by soraya saga was originally intended for final fantasy 7 but it was too dark and complicated     according to interviews she writes character motivations and relationships to fulfill the plot   she also wrote sabin and edgar for final fantasy vi she basically just started with monk and machines and wrote with a desert landscape in mind from there they became brother kings     kosmos was her husbands creation they meant her to be a fragile soul in an indestructible body  the opposite of humans having resilient souls with fragile bodies soraya left during episode 2 their 6 part story was cut to 3 creating major changes   knowing that soraya writes characters to fulfill a plot it kinda informs you were the story was headed and how much of kosmos story wasnt told
    the secret was that the games didnt have to cater to broad appeal so the developers could focus on making a good game for their core audiences and anything over that was just gravy
  bof4 is a masterpiece    i love bof4 filler island was probably my favorite part of the game im not kidding it was just such a nice and much needed break to relax and take in things so were fresh and ready to take in the even more horrible things were about to witness
  rpgs benefit from having no voice acting  this
  when you can read faster than the characters talk    i think it goes beyond just no voice though like limited animation can really be more of a benefit than you realize limited sprites or cut ins have to focus on conveying emotions in a very relatable almost universal way when you can make full on movies a lot of the times characters lets call them mannerisms can come off like theyre all off their rocker insane maybe its a translation barrier thing but trying to watch whatever to fuck vanille from ff12 was doing was mind boggling whereas someone like say yuffie comes off more endearing with her quick jabs or all the ways the characters reacted to aeriths death all very simple emotions being convey in a way where you didnt need a whole of flash bang to get what everyone was feeling i get it probably all goes back to japan being big on stage and theater but dial it back a bit for fucks sake
xenogears has horrific writing though
    these
  there is something to be said for not being able to clearly see every aspect of a scene and our imaginations ability to fill in the gaps
    i highly disagree its just that bad or soso voice acting can make things so much worse good voice acting can enhance things a lot but sadly a lot of /vr/ stuff does not have that
  wrong voice acting appears to enhance things but all it does is it removes further engagement from the player to read and process the information by making the game do it for for him its also likely the character you listen to has a less likable voice than youd imagine for that not to happen the voice acting direction and actors themselves have to be really fucking good which makes costs so high they detract from overall development     its just not practical and has too many downsides for games unless used smartly which means sparingly morrowind would be a good example in fact they could have added a few more lines here and there
  plenty of drugs the economy in japan being as bad as it was in the 90s making everyone who was writing bitter as fuck also helped their creativeness too
  voice acting means a hard development deadline past which the story is locked with zero further improvements
  good voice acting can enhance things a lot  yes but usually at a significant cost including monetary costs to hire actors restrictions on writers to write good speakable dialog and the cost of players time to watch/listen every second of the recorded dialog and even then individual scenes can still go either way  id estimate theres enough content in xenogears to fill 23 seasons of a game of thrones style tv series    also this   maybe its a translation barrier thing but trying to watch whatever to fuck vanille from ff12  i think vanille is definitely a case of a japanesestyle character intended for japanese audiences and the english version specifically tried to preserve that character  but i think your point still stands      i think this is especially true in the rpg genre which was originally designed to do exactly that the gameplay systems oriented around player character stats and tactical decisions are meant to stimulate your imagination to fill in the gaps or in a tabletop setting someone might narrate the details on the fly      xenogears has horrific writing though  no it doesnt the writing in xenogears is a mix of very good and very bad it has high highs and low lows both for individual segments and the big picture it has a lot of great characters portrayed with care and subtlety fei bart citan elly ramsus krelian but some characters arent that great and their storylines are just dropped rico others are cool but kind of ridiculous and convoluted grahf/wiseman it does a fantastic job of weaving fei and ellys storyline through multiple eras but gets hung up with too many named concepts and complicated supernatural relationships it does a great job slowly developing fei as a protagonist showing real growth and maturation over the course of the game but the plot fucking drags at numerous points kislev that stretch on the thames
  i actually have a theory about this    my idea is that everything from art direction to innovative gameplay ideas to plot and dialogue all seemed better back then because devs had to work around a lot of limitations    if your game cant have amazing graphics amazing frame rate 40 characters on screen at once blah blah blah then you take things not hardware intensive like dialogue and work that shit to cover up the technical limitations basically showing off how awesome you are with nontechnical stuff    by contrast modern games look amazing and anything you can think of can be done so devs dont spend so much time focusing on anything but graphics and such   and i dont think its a contious thing either i really think it was gradual and as it got easier and technical limitations got less restrictive devs just went with the flow    like imagine developing a game for ps1 having a vision realising oh we cant do this or that and having to rework a lot of shit in contrast imagine deving for ps4 where your original idea just gets done and works so no need to rework jack shit and no need to make your game appealing in non technical ways    or at least thats my theory
  yes thats true but how much do you need  and if one is to be honest are we talking full va va for important set pieces dialogue you can mash trough ala kotor/witcher  and how do it compare with things like voices turned into soundfonts so it sounds like pingu or zelda with its gibberish for dialogue matching with the scrolling text    i find your statement to be inhonest or not self reflected and if its not reflected it will never stand a argument or examination   i find the va vs not to be a large dishonest debate where people cant even examine the options and just try to go like witcher 3 vs final fantasy 1 to even argue about instead of fallout 2 vs zelda64 where both feature voice lines to various degrees  and as a non english speaker i can only appreciate quality i dont masturbate to peoples names or them doing the role i did in that movie now everyone wants me to do that there exists things like legacy of kain which is carried on the quality of voice acting
  tfw sh1 had a great script in japanese but the translation doesnt hold a candle  i wish jeremy blaustein was around for sh1 his sh2 and 3 translations are top tier
  what makes ps1 game scripts different  your nostalgia
    butthurt n64 manchild
  good writing
  what does the n64 have to do with anything  it doesnt even have games
  anon made a reasonable assumption that a stupid comment like that came from a nintendrone
  im right there with you its like the nurse scene in romeo and juliette where the lightness of it gives that breather so the tragedy then hits even harder
  not him but i agree with him when its good voice acting really added to a game mgs is probably the best retro example but when its bad like in grandia for example and theres no way to turn it off then it can really ruin a game     i like the witcher 3 approach when its done well as in that game but if the quality of it is less than excellent i would much rather have no voice at all
  because devs had to work around a lot of limitations  what complete nonsense on the nes and snes devs were working around limitations the ps1 gave us mgs and vagrant story showing us there are no limits to creative cinematic story telling in 3d
  fewer to be sure  but still those games had to fit on cdroms it became much more realistic in 6th gen with dvds
  dont even talk to me if your game doesnt have an instant text speed option
good writing  pause for effect  music swells for emotional impact  cut to black  disheartened anon closed the browser tab he had come no closer to understanding npc characterization why on earth would he take writing advice from people who couldnt read
  youre imagining things you were just younger back then so they seemed better written and deeper than they actually were    also youre probably comparing the top ps1 games to bad/average modern games
  missing the point this hard    ever think those games turned out so great is b3ecause they had to work around mad limitations    how many ps1 games look as good as vagrant story it honestly doesnt push the hardware all that hard as its a 40 hour long game that takes up less than 100 mb of space lack of cgi is one cause sure but the polygonal models arent that complex the textures are blurry shit compared to today and the frame rate is 30fps or less    the gameplay is half real time half turn based and they clearly used sound design art direction and creative problem solving to work around all the limitations ofnthe hardware    mgs isneven worse its 2 hours of gameplay a ton of super small areas up close the graphics look pixilated even for ps1 standards and etc if they could just do exactly what they wanted theyd both have looked like ps3 games had no load times and lprobably been drastically different games all around    if you disagree thats fine but youre still wrong
  i picked this up from an rpg maker community good character dialogue is revealing their life activities motivations and relationships     at the beginning to xenogears the villagers are preparing for a wedding the groom is excited and looking toward the future the bride is a little hesitant of the change looking toward the past the brides brother doesnt want the groom as a brotherinlaw and wishes you would marry his sister instead focusing on the present soraya says explains a theme of questions where did we come from who are we now where will we go from here    in ff8 the garden npcs are students and faculty although people live at the garden year round the beginning of the game its basically the end of a semester with exams and graduation  which is what everyone talks about and then after becoming a seed everyone is looking forward to next year and what they can change the next goaround to be different   they maintain an awareness of events throughout the game too so while theyre standing in the same place its suggestive that they are doing things while youre away     its a different treatment of modern rpgs where npcs have no life and stand around to explain the kingdoms history or treasure that contextualizes the plot points but doesnt characterize the npcs at all
  it was an experimental era jrpgs got too big after that
  so you disagree with my point then bring ip cinematic story telling which was an invention of the ps1 era basically provong my point    if ps1 could do anything any dev wanted easily there would be a lot fewer story driven games with prerendered backgrounds you dolt because work arounds like that are needed for weaker hardware to make your product appealing  also why techniques like prerendered anything and cenematic gameplay arent overly used now because any modern hardware can just do whatever you want and story driven games are usually aaa horseshit designed to be beaten once and forgotten about until the dlc comes out but thats another topic entirely
  also id like to add that if vs came out today it would just be a straight arpg and probably have no chain system or risk     and yes im implying those things are a product of hardware limitations forcing the team to think outside the box to provide a halfway decent game
  you can argue better or worse but anon did specify  what makes ps1 game scripts different  games like xenogears and bof4 have a way of bringing npcs to life with just a little bit of dialogue whats the secret    also youre probably comparing the top ps1 games to bad/average modern games  what about a game like xenoblade chronicles 2 setting aside the waifu/shonen shit for a moment  the writing is professional and probably a much higher standard than xenogears overall many scenes are crafted exceptionally well from a dramatic standpoint but its also anime as fuck way more than xenogears dialog is often drawn out characters are constantly striking stock anime poses such as malos and jin scenes like the first one at the central exchange feel kind of boring like did this really need to be a voiced cutscene i think thats the kind of thing op is talking about in ps1 era melolo would have been made distinctive with just a few lines of text not a whole 60 second cutscene
  well in xenogears the script is completely unfinished and the second half is a hilarious mess thats what makes it different    no it doesnt  yes it does theres the seeds of a good script in there but what we got is a fucking disaster it needs at least 12 months more developement and several rewrites
  if you have nothing specific to criticize fuck off you arent impressing anyone
look guys this is definitely a situation where occams razor applies i respect how passionate people can get with theories like this  but at the end of the day its very simple talented developers do good work thats it good writers write good scripts thats it theres no bygone magic that was lost in the ps1 era theres no deep profound reason why xenogears and other ps1 jrpgs have comparatively good scripts  its just because the people who made the games were good at what they do what makes ps1 game scripts different nothing they arent different its just bias and retro game fetishism that would make you think that way good people did good work then and now    of course nes games and the like were severely limited by cartridge space and couldnt include large scripts because of this but thats another story entirely
  so youre saying that given equally talented developers and writers there are literally no differences at all between a script for a game intended to be entirely text and a script meant for voiced actors nothing we could possibly talk about
  goes on about graphics in a script thread
    a decade of game making where they couldnt make the stories they wanted due to limitations they had material saved up its that simple
  he pops up in every xg thread the game must have raped and murdered his mother or something hide the posts and move on
    theyre more connected than youd think the way you can tell and present a story greatly effects how it needs to be written
  bravely default has a neat trick to compensate for this where the characters speak as concisely as possible in their first line of text and go into more detail and by the time you finish reading the text they usually finish that first sentence  also helps if you dont want to skip a scene but youve already seen it you just hit next after every first sentence
    how is that better thats exactly the problem im talking about it doesnt matter how concise the sentence is its a drag waiting for them to catch up
  this it wasnt about compensating for limited technology it was the opposite making rpgs of this quality was new and exciting people had tons of ideas from playing older rpgs or dnd sessions      not to mention japan blatantly copied from each other all the time and no one cared
    man i miss when anime developers understood that the anime needs to be able to exist on its own even if it meant taken some liberties yeah it will piss off the ln/manga fags but youre gonna get more people into your series by introducing it to them in a way they can enjoy rather than wasting however much money and time just to make some crappy 12 episode commercial for a book im not going to read
  a character says  wait somethings lurks nearby    by the time hes done saying wait youll already have read the rest and the period leave a slight pause in between so you can skip to the next line without feeling like youve missed anything and still getting the emotion of the voice acting
voice acting is good writing  animation direction is good writing  camera techniques is good writing   things that have nothing to do with written text is good writing
    or i could just read it all and not be a line skipping faggot because i dont have add
  its because the closer games get to cinematics the closer they get to (((hollywood))) ill get banned for saying any more so ill leave it at that
  thats some great reading comprehension there
    except and this is the key issue i read faster than they talk even if they skip to their next line it doesnt change that im still faster
  why are you pressing the enter key twice after quoting someone
  le reddit boogeyman oh noes
  i said nothing about reddit why are you pressing enter twice after quoting someone
  le reddit boogeyman ohh noes
  says nothing about reddit  you make it about reddit  kill yourself put a fucking shotgun down your soiboi throat
    le seething oldfag is le buggmad
  maybe if you read slower you would have realized the following  thats what i meant when i said skipping to the next line i meant that you skip to it before the voice clip finishes not skipping before you finish reading it
  play legend of mana fagot
  choreography is writing  silent fmvs is writing    has fuck all to do with npc dialogue how do you manage to take it this far out of context when op put it into context for you it sheds some doubt on your ability to comprehend a 40hr rpg when your idea of staying on topic is reinterpreting what the op wrote into something wildly different as an excuse to speak to your own points
  put a fucking bullet in your brain
  xenogears script written by soraya saga was originally intended for final fantasy 7 but it was too dark and complicated    the eldridge was to be a colony drop that killed 400 million people concept was cool square brass wasnt
  agree with most of this but there are still some modern issues i think the main thing is any game with a large budget these days gets way more oversight than they used to for example  applies because devs probably dont have the option to forego vas in a big rpg even if they want to big rpgs arent allowed to be as experimental as they once were because almost no game is a big rpg these days is either going to be anime as fuck instead of just having anime influence or its not turnbased
    this surely reeks of a game developer wannabe trying to convince people that scripts can still be as intense and truthful as ever as if there are plenty of external factors that ensure that sort of script cant be written anymore
  there are plenty of external factors that ensure that sort of script cant be written anymore  such as
    even back on the ps2 people where bitching if the games didnt have voice acting
  oh i dont know how about the sociopolitical state of the world what about high as fuck development costs that require any entertainment product to do virtue signalling and hurt both ludo and narrative aspects in order to make its money back aaa games will never gamble like that anymore you wont get another xenogears another mgs2 those were experimental times in more ways than one japans game industry took a big hit they somewhat recovered nowadays but still nowhere as big as the 90s  you could argue that such a script could be in a indie game but that sort of smaller game seems to be a western practice and indie games have nothing but liberal propaganda as far as story goes
  because there was a lot of good anime for video games to rip off from people still dont seem to realize that video game directors and writers are seen as being 3rd rate below the ones in the anime industry that is why those in the video game industry are always so desperate to break out into anime or live action like kojima tried and failed successfully doing so is a way of legitimizing ones self as being truly talented modern anime is ass though so modern games will be equally ass
    remember when square was riding off all that ff7 money and got really crazy and made a bunch of insane shit like fighters racing games and even a schmup for no reason other than they could i miss that time when games where a big profit but the required returns werent so retarded that a game hitting a million units was considered a big deal
    i dont think this is accurate aaa back then was about the same scope as many indies are now the problem isnt that you cant make good stuff its that itll just get drowned out by the sheer volume of other stuff around it
  bof4 sucks dude lol stupid minigames stupid story with stupid moments like ershins death and stupid minigames    xenogears sucks too
    makes sense that a faggot with wrong opinions would use a picture of mgs4
  do you realize that writers write more than dialog
  do you realize this isnt a general topic  do you realize op specified dialogue  do you realize how off topic and unsociable it is to recontexualize someone elses point so you can rant and rave about hardware limitations and anything and everything to do with the verb writing
  voice acting appears to enhance things but all it does is it removes further engagement from the player to read and process the information by making the game do it for for him its also likely the character you listen to has a less likable voice than youd imagine  this and its also the reason books are almost always better than the hollywood films based on them when reading you fill in the gaps with your imagination when playing a game on dated hardware like the ps1 theres enough detail that you can see whats going on but with no or limited voice acting and rudimentary polygons some things are still left to imagine compare ff7 to advent children the same characters and setting but almost everyone would agree that ff7 had better writing and character exchanges why because the way you imagine cloud barret and tifa interacting during dialog and a limited amount of lego brick hand gestures is always going to be more interesting to you personally than the way some japanese director mocap actor and voice actor have collectively decided this person acts like
  thats nice i think movies go better with popcorn but im not going to judge the writing based on the theaters concession stand thats insane
  its a product of the 90s everything back then had a certain higher quality to it and i believe it had to do with an excitement for the future world wide not being tethered to smart devices people were more balanced and bringing to their work the experiences they had growing up in the 70s and 80s     nowadays what are the experiences this newer work force has had the product given to them in the 90s and 00s but less human experiences leading to more watereddown writing and ideas creativity is on a major decline because were spoon fed
  if you cant stop sucking cocks there are more appropriate boards for you
  so talk about the writing retard
keeping the script more concise while still retaining its quality is what made those games stick out so much japan has always been really good at expressing a lot of character through clever visuals and really concise condensed scripts thats anime and manga in a nutshell thats why chrono trigger practically exudes character from every pixel or hell look at fighting game characters   now the reason why you dont see as much quality anymore is another story entirely
silent hill was on the psx playstation 1
  whats a good jrpg anon legit interested as i was pretty underwhelmed by xenogears and bof4 lunar and suikoden were good i thought
  i think that people in the past read more and that reading makes you a much better writer than does watching film or playing games      colony drop kills 400 million    thats all
  spoon fed  i didnt plan on posting in this stupid thread but something about your word choice rubs me the wrong way it implies that modern devs grew up in an environment where too little was demanded of them and thats why they didnt become strong men who create good times and thats bullshit in fact its backwards modern society demands more of children at a younger age it puts them in an officelike environment where everything they do is measured and they have deadlines to meet they adapt to this and survive it but they come out believing that deadlines are the only things that matter  old devs played they went outside the creator of pokemon played with bugs the zelda devs went for walks in the woods they had time to themselves where they could destress and let their minds wander they had unstructured social interaction they thought about shit that didnt matter and experienced life at their own pace that shit prepares people to be better writers whether or not theyre planning to make a career out of it younger devs skipped all that to get through increasingly shitty school systems that only prepare them to have anxiety couple that with equally soulless managers sacrificing quality wherever they can for the sake of cutting costs and everything is fucked
    seething game dev
  its rare to see such violent agreement on this board
  you have a good point maybe our system was just in a sweet spot during that erayou have a good point that our school systems are becoming increasingly demanding but i do think people are becoming increasingly lazier
    its the systems fault  its the education fault  its the economys fault  anything but me    good old millennials
5th gen fags have no awareness all the cinematic stuff started in that time and the writting doesnt really differ as much
less is more    the more detailed the graphics become the more obvious bad animation becomes
  nobody likes to admit faults you dumbnumb
this reads less as a critic of young fags and more as an attempt to elevate old geezers because you realize when youre old your life is at a dead end so you make up some bullshit that youngs have no real experiences or whatever
unless you are japanese or a fluent reader of japanese you literally do not know how good or bad the writing in any jrpg is theres no point having this discussion when the very foundatioon of your argument is completely flawed
  うるさい
  who is this handsome shota and why is he so dreamy
  五月蝿い  if you want to show off at least do it properly
  腹立つが
  nigger what no one uses kanji for that shit you have no practice reading nor writing nor speaking japanese kindly remove yourself from the premises
  who is this cute shota and why do i want to kiss his forehead
  the point is that youre a faggot for showing off your basic as fuck elemental grade japanese boku no nihongo ha totemo jouzu dess
  compare ff7 to advent children  the same characters and setting    yeah just like any disney live action remake totally the same
  anon its you you personally you are the one individual at fault for every problem with the game industry today its all on your shoulders what are you going to do about it    seriously now in what reality can a widespread systemic problem be blamed on each individual do you think human nature is somehow different for other people than for you
  see haikus for short consist yet conveys meaning well
  it is a direct sequel with the same characters just because you dont like it doesnt make it any less canon
  it is the same though the only thing thats changed is voice acting and mocap if you took ff7ac and rendered it in ff7 ingame with text bubbles accompanied by 1997 squats and arm waves youd probably like it a lot more not because it would be higher quality but because your memory of the characters as they were would not be sullied by va
    it means the reverse is true that if its good then credit goes to those thing too     but allow me to demystify this because the writers didnt get replaced with a new generation theyre still working   theres 2 explanations for why a writers work would suddenly be trash 1 they had a stroke 2 they were never good and their career was riding on the editor/ghostwriters talents that realize the script beyond an outline     everything went to shit in 0708 because of a writers guild of america went on strike these were the editors and advisors who punch up punchlines and reword drafts to be more effective this included translators and localization teams tokyopop had to restructure their company at this time too it wasnt just the economy that contributed to the suck factor they lost all their hired talent in the process japan experienced a similar crisis a few years earlier with many writers walking away halfway through development it wasnt as noticeable because overseas would tiddy it up for their release 2006 was the overlapping year when nobody was around to polish their turds
  ac being an actual video game with interactivity would do far more to its service than the visual and aural delivery you put so much ridiculous emphasis on i believe what you say has a role to an extent but acs problems were largely from being a movie that cannot be interacted with whatsoever    text bubbles and vague cute emotes invites the imagination in a way but being able to engage with the world through combat and exploration accomplishes the same far more significantly and the lack of that is what bugged people about ff7ac more than anything else
  an actual video game with interactivity  implying interactivity makes it a game   gtfo and take you visual novels with you
  if you took ff7ac and rendered it in ff7 ingame    if i did that the two games art directions would clash like a bitch for starters but you have a point about the text bubbles and arm waving plus the slow pans and general scenography all paired by the cutesy shibuya styled overworld models that helped the game keep a lighthearted storybook feel while still facing rocky themes i cannot imagine ff7 in any other way and i love ff8 to death so im not averse to more grounded presentations even though ff8 still had a lot of that anime charm that went away after 10
  this and its also the reason books are almost always better than the hollywood films based on them  movies are a bad comparison to novels because they have very different constraints movies must compress a narrative into a single 90120 minute event up to 180 in extreme cases they have no room for extraneous characters and very limited room for any kind of digression or secondary plotlines    so anyone that has read a novel is likely to find some reason to be disappointed by a movie when compared sidebyside
its not an issue of old vs new its an issue of size and creative control    older final fantasies rpgs etc are going to reflect more on the development team because they were created by smaller tighterknit groups of people modern games in that sense take on two forms where you either have the auteur heavily in control of the story or a game thats essentially developed by ruthless business sense and market research older games tend to have a lot more rough edges which adds to the charm because you can see the concessions the development team or writers had to do with the limited technology    thats why i like playing rpgmaker games or indie games like crosscode some modern rpgs can be close to what im looking for like lost odyssey but for the most part the hyperpolish and design by committee approach aaa games take is something that i just dont care about
ive read a bunch of good arguments in this thread good discussion    personally i think the 90s in general were just a sweet spot for video game storytelling writers finally had some advanced tools and methods to tell their stories but they were still limited enough that a they had to get creative and b people still had to rely on their imagination to fill in the gaps
  yeah its important to remember that in the context of history with the nes and snes to an extent developers and translators were often limited by memory constraints and in some cases even text box size or paragraph size its easier to convey an idea or a statement in a couple characters in japanese due to kanji its harder when you have one line of english to convey whats effectively a paragraph of discussion in japanese thats why we had a lot of goofy writing back then not even going to go into the ridiculous deadlines and tiny oneperson teams many games had for translation as well     once more fully developed systems like the saturn psx and dreamcast came along it became a lot easier to write whatever the hell you wanted to without worrying about time space or budget this is also when console gaming really took off in the west and developers were more willing to pay for 23 good translators instead of some random bilingual guy with no knowledge of games willing to do it for bottom dollar in 14 days
  people bitch about woolsey translations a lot around here but i think sometimes they are unappreciative for the amount of effort that went into those games i mean that was the same era as breath of fire 1s translation tecmo secret of the stars and lots of other games with god awful script truncation due to editing rom and actually fitting what you want into the game being so difficult at the time if square had wanted the games out quicker or spent a little less money on translation the ff and ct we got could have been translated a lot rougher even if you look at ff2 us the script is heavily trimmed and many items have severely butchered or clipped names because they couldnt fucking fit anything in
  well theres also the fact that in the 90s very few games outside of rpgs had much of a story in the first place sure games like ninja gaiden and mega man had a narrative but it was usually little more than a way to provide some structure and context for the gameplay
  thanks for hijacking my thread so you could have an argument that had absolutely nothing to do with npc dialogue   if you created your own topic you wouldnt look like a sperg
  le what were they smoking  cringe
  who is this qt pie and why is he so shota
  theyre earnest compare sh1 to any of the dishonest tripe that comes out today
  aaa back then was closer to modern single a budget titles like those from pirahna bytes and spiders/cyanide than to current indies
  writers dont do the jobs of directors or dps
  most of the old writers have stopped working
    thats all    basically ever notice some of the elements of xenogears looking as if they were assets from what could have been other projects to a degree they were xenogears is the end result of a game that started as a potential ff vii then a possible contender for chrono trigger 2 then the original idea between takahashi and his wife project noah to the final result of xenogears takahashi and his wife wanted to reinvent the whole jrpg experience with a science fiction series that had as broad a vision as say dune or the lensmen series
    the father of ever single humanoid being of the world that xenogears takes place
  right xenogears had an inconsistent music font with some tracks sounding like they they belong to final fantasy tactics or chrono cross   sound effects were recycled from fft pretty sure the menu was reskinned for chrono cross they had the same text window functionality in that you could talk to npcs and still move around in xenogears the save menu will load the icons from other game data in chrono cross other save data will be represented with the xenogears icon which still psyches me out    as mentioned  soraya wrote sabin and edgar for ffvi   its no coincidence that xenogears would also have another blonde hair desert prince with another moving fortress that submerges in sand and takes a secret underground path to cross between landmasses
    the basic treatment for gears that would have been vii started with a solider who has amnesia or a forced repression of memory this is the character who becomes fei ever notice the odd looking symbols on weltallid well thats because it was supposed to be omega weapon the base story was that once upon a time humanity and magic creatures lived togeather humans could not use magic and often lived in fear of or oppressed to those that could the moogles those who became chuchus race knew of technology and gave humanity its secrets beyond building just airships this took off with mankind and humanity hyper industrialized with the works of mankind now causing issue with the natural world a conflict was brewing in short omega weapon is piloted by the character that becomes fei and accidents in a major conflict with what sounds like a aeon the space colony that is being constructed as humanities crowning achievement is crashed into the mega city killing all those people scarce basic broken sora was going through much at the time and to a degree its a wonder that xenogears was even made
  sorry i have no idea about anything youre talking about and have never played any of these games i was just making a driveby tomino joke becuase 400 million is a pretty small death toll for his shit
    np anon its all bullshit anyway because shit game is shit
   up to 180 in extreme cases  more like 430 minutes in extreme cases and theres probably longer movies than satantango
  op is a faggot
  let me show off my obscure mopie industry knowledge
  a three hour movie isnt an extreme outlier by any capacity
low resolution and fidelity games cause your brain to compensate more and subsequently be more immersed than modern graphics allow  stories werent necessarily better but you were more open to the experience due to that    t retard speaking right out of his ass
  yeah but those 430 minute movies are and theyre entirely irrelevant
  also the lack of voice acting furthers this situation you get to fill in the blanks for everything and find it more enjoyable    its why you recoil when you go back to play a remaster  its not just nostalgia burning but the fact that that they desecrated your experience by adding stupid shit
  they are not in the context of looking at extreme cases thats what extreme means
    how is not relevant you said in some extreme cases well guess what thats the extreme case
nobody cares about your shitty european 20 hour movies
if i had to guess probably because it was a transitional period between games where characters were characterized entirely by text and games where they were characterized by voice acting and their gestures
  a three hour movie isnt an extreme outlier by any capacity  its not an outlier but its at the extreme end of what typical theater audiences are expected to tolerate the godfather is considered a long movie and it clocks in at just under 3 hours the lotr movies are about 114 combined but only the extended version the theatrical releases were much shorter    the point is that the movie format will almost always cut and condense content from a longer format such as a novel or jrpg xenogears has 6 major villains for example even in a 3 hour movie version would probably cut or merge some of those villains together
  3 hours is still not that extreme
in xenogears npcs have a history with the characters their dialogue will change depending on who is in your party   they talk to the characters not to the player
this fucking piece of shit game xenogears just erased my save file 10 hours in
  it depends on what you mean by extreme extreme doesnt have to mean rare 180 minutes give or take a few is at the extreme length of a movie that you can typically see in a theater    on the scope of every movie made from 1930 to present ok maybe the extreme is more like 220 minutes with movies like the ten commandments but if you scan imdb youll see that the vast majority of projects over 200 minutes are not conventional movies they are tv series or miniseries a format much closer to jrpgstyle storytelling the rest are outliers and really just not part of the discussion theres no way anon who originally made a movie comparison was thinking of fucking 7hour experimental movies
    like some mentioned earlier the game devs of the past were the first generation unlike todays makers who derive their works from earlier games the first generation had work from scratch that means that the talent you got into your department were more likely to have a background in more classic literally arts    basically the script writers were better at writing because they probably read more books and had more solid writing fundamentals    also smaller company but also lower budget costs but not necessarily budget restraints also smaller dev teams it was a more flexible work environment for the script writers
  satantango  obscure
  its obscure to anyone who doesnt have a hipster beard and showers regularly
  your nostalgia
  your nostalgia
    its trying to save you from the prison scenario
  i dont like what you said so its cringey    thats pretty cringey in itself
  my answer dont waste your time playing jrpgs
    give arcanum a shot
  thats not how it works esl
what did this game understand that modern fighting games cant seem to grasp    besides coming out in an era before dlc was possible
this shit aint retro but color edit is based
  4 years later and you still refuse to read the sticky
theres nothing particularly special about it balancewise its just a love letter to both companies at a time when fighting games suffered a final death and we went into the dark ages yes snkp and asw released games during this period but almost no one seemed to care its just full of neat touches like in the screen there you have them trading artists shinkiros art shows for the capcom characters while nishimuras art shows for the snk characters while your selected portraits pick the artist based off your groove
  that your options are supposed to be good and fun to use basically every modern fighter nerfs universal defensive options into the ground and removes things from characters that the developers dont see as part of their vision for the game cvs2 actually did fall prey to this with eo but thankfully we dont have to play that version of the game    as much as cvs2 is my favorite capcom fighter i would say guilty gear xx as a series did a better job of embracing what made the game good and unique
snk vs capcom was actually a better game with more love put into it
dlc paid online locked content and season passes ruined this genre
  maybe from an aesthetic perspective though id disagree with that as well mechanically cvs2 is leaps and bounds ahead of cvs standardizing the game to six buttons was a good decision that allowed the characters to work better in every groovethe character designs are far more fleshed out and theres more of them the grooves add much more meaningful strategic variety last but not least roll cancel accidentally created a very unique and good aspect to playing defense in 2d fighters
  lolno
  lolyes what snk did with their rendition of capcom characters sprites was way more creative look at dhalsim or guile it actually had character endings plus it was not just mostly street fighter vs kof and brought in a more diverse roster from both companies franchises also being a 240p game its art holds up better years later with scanlines while the capcom titles were ugly 480i crap with lowpolygonal backgrounds
  oh i misread your original post you mean that svc chaos one of the worst fighting games ever made is better than cvs2 let me laugh even harder
  dont be upset that snk draws capcom better than capcom
  svc chaos had a lot of cool presentation gimmicks and much as i loved the prefight dialogue and unique character endings cvs2 was a way better game to play
  the original sprites capcom made for cvs look fantastic for the most part look at maki or ryu
  m bison looks like crap in svc
  yes but like 3/4s of the capcom cast are still alpha 1/2 era sprites i will definitely say svc chaos is much more visually consistent but holy hell does it play like garbage
  roll cancels suck and ruin the game
  scrubby sense is tingling
  shit balance  shit roster  boring gameplay  awful presentation  bugged to shit    cvs2 is not a very good fighting game
  do you just say things and see who takes the bait
this game pisses me off so bad it looks like the perfect fighter for me but all i have is the dc version and the controls are so bad its unplayable
  should get a total control 3
what is build engine equivelent for gzdoom
  there is none the ports are on a pergame basis they dont really mesh together as well as doom engine games i think eduke32 is the popular duke3d one bloods got nothin but guesswork avoid any source ports of that
  eduke32  bloodgdx  redneckgdx  shadow warrior redux
  go to /vr/doom dont waste threads
  i bet youre the same fag who screeches about muh aspect ratio and so on although the original blood is outstanding its a nobrainer that you cant make it work the right way on new pcs me too as a purist i was reluctant about bloodgdx but after i gave it a shot ive never switched back    this
i always preferred megaton edition to eduke32 i dont want a chocolate doom type expierience with duke i want it to look good sadly the hrp looks kinda shitty now days they ruined the pistol and shotgun
  megaton edition is the real patrician choice
  all good but theres yet another rr port released recently not sure how it compares to the gdx one its based off eduke32  
  rednukem is supposedly better
how are these games i only ever played wipeout hd since i got it free after that psn downtime for a month thing but i enjoyed it i expect the older games are the same basically
play style and sensations are very different
  the original was a release title for the original ps no analog you had to tap left and right or you would crash because you would veer into walls start boost was the same  no pilot assist the original up to xl took skill
quite different they have a distinct floaty and difficult physics style compared to the new games the steering is very useful in comparison and air brakes slow you down a lot in addition to making you slide in the opposite direction pitching is also much more important hitting walls is more punishing tracks are more narrow and difficult hitting boost pads isnt as important there are no mid air flips but 3 has a boost system thats more free form and allows for some advanced techniques air brakes being slidey also allows some cool tech a lot of tracks without using any air brakes at all on ships with decent steering its a more fun dynamic but more difficult gameplay style
  you could get analog controls with the negcon
  theres a freeware remake of the first two games i forget what its called but its on steam
  ballisticng its not really a remake its not free anymore and has more similarities to wo3 than the first two great game though
    and even better now you can either set up default epsxe necgon plugin and bind analog steering to sticks or use lillypad plugin with any other emulator you prefer and bind analog input to anything from ps2 controller to a steering wheel    there is nothing better than ridge/rage racer and wipeout becoming actually playable
  wo plays really well on pad though can get some damn good times np
poor mans fzero or pod racer
  more like f zero/podracer with actually good handling and feel instead of cheap plastic toy feeling crap
  there was also a pc port of the first game i wonder what kind of control scheme it had id assume it could accept joysticks at least
what are the best super nintendo games to play with your gf while cuddling  i already have kirby superstar but looking for something more slowpaced
  beavis and butthead
  it might be funny i had the sega genesis one as a kid and it was kind of confusing is the snes one better
you know the us console design wasnt that bad
  i know its actually very nifty and classic  i love both models
  way better than the koala face    op i recommend turnbased games things that you dont need to be too focused on will be better
  bebes kids  michael jordan chaos in the windy city  shaqfu  rap jam volume one  nba jam
  i dont know if she will like turn based games but which ones would you recommend nothing too strategyish    id unironically play the shit out of nba jam tournament edition actually

  not retro
  shut the fuck up
id like to play a jrpg where the battles are mainly bosses with some optional and oneofakind mook battles on the side     if the number of fights in the game are finite this adds a whole new layer of strategy to the game because theres finite xp finite ap for whatever abilities you choose to use or equip and then also finite resources like potions that these battles can eat up     this would also remove grinding entirely which only bug people and npcs can enjoy mook encounters in jrpgs almost never require any strategy theyre always just mindless tedium the boss fights are where the fun is really at id like to see a lot less of the former and more of the latter the main appeal of jrpgs for most people are the crazy ass convoluted stories you just dont see anywhere else thats why ff7ff10 are so fucking good plus exploration and bosses     you would still do everything you do now in a jrpg but without brainless tedious encounters you know explore find secrets talk to npcs solve puzzles make story choices and fight unique enemies
  there are plenty of jrpgs that are designed for you to go from boss fight to boss fight optional generic fodder enemies are included to make games playable for subhumans but this in no way detracts from the main intended experience
  lets go pikachu
  bug people
  the boss fights are where the fun is  discover elemental weakness with scan style spell  nuke them the next turn and win within 5 turns  fun
  not all bosses are like that specifically the good ones
  jrpgs  fun
  jrpgs   not fun
      being a big enough nerd to even know what the letters jrpg stand for
  jawesome rocket powered grenade
  japanese rocket propelled grenades
      these are both acceptable answers japanese roly poly gangsters is also counts
  i respect your taste but what youre describing is basically not a jrpg imo its a strategy game
  nah its literally the same game without grinding
how do i get a girlfriend like tifa
riviera but its not retro
  yes it is
play growlanser
  it was released on three handheld platforms which all came out after the ps2
  gba is retro
  never will be
  id like to play a jrpg where main heroine has tits as big as i could fap them on  t 1216 yo player auditory
  it first released on the wonderswan so its technically retro
  wonderswan color which was released in december 2000  not retro
    sorry but jrpgs are made for people who enjoy the art of grinding if you are looking for streamlined cinematic stuff play recent wrpgs
  not retro and not japanese but the age of decadence is similar to what youre looking for
  final fantasy iv free enterprise randomizer  i know youre looking for a new game with a new story etc but ff4fe is a great template for an explorationbased jrpg focused on just boss battles with occasional fighting grinding is still part of the meta game but basically only about 10 minutes max for a 12 hour playthrough
  sounds like youre actually interested in srpgs like final fantasy tactics ogre battle or fire emblem explore that genre its way better than traditional jrpgs
is it just me or are light gun games really tiring  also are you supposed to hold the gun as close to the screen as possible like in this pic
they are 1ccing time crisis 2 always hurt me like hell even without skipping the cutscenes
  thats how i played duck hunt on nes
  nice i just wanna keep playing but after about 10 minutes of house of the dead im sore as hell i guess maybe ill build up the muscle with time and practice
/k/ would be laughing at you all right now if you think a plastic gun is tiring try a real gun which weighs ten times as much or more
  yeah its not often youre spamming the trigger for extended periods of time and making jerky movements to reload with a real gun though
  but you are making jerky movements its called recoil
  some light gun games have recoil too like time crisis and point blank
  go to shooting range and improve your spreads for 60 minutes  the same thing  yeah no
  in an arcade you dont have any choice but to stand close to the screen
  yep even when the screen is in a separate box a few feet behind where your gun is you dont have any choice except to hop over and get close to the screen
  on sega dreamcast i rebinded all the buttons to fire except for both triggers to reload and used a controller instead of a lightgun for house of the dead 2 and emptied the clip basically instantly with infinite ammo instant reloads never aiming outside of the screen overpowered and stupid but funny shit you can do with silly ports  obviously i have guns and have beaten it the right way but yeah they can be tiring get some arm strength op work out a little bit so you can play some videogames light gun games are fun as fuck and most do give you some moments where you can take a breather also if youre playing on a console at home maybe some of them have pause function a luxury you dont get in the arcade lol
  protip for lightgun games with shoot offscreen to reload just put your finger over the guns light sensor so it cant see the screen and pull the trigger now you can reload without moving the gun away from your target
  hate to say thats not what the developers intended but it isnt why not just play normal instead of whats essentially cheating
you are supposed to stand back a bit and aim through the retical other wise you are cheating it also allow you to point the gun all over the screen making very small movements
  you are supposed to do things the way some kid on the internet says other wise you are cheating  sure thing kiddo  retical  lol you sound like one of those kids who watches too much tv and thinks people irl actually walk around with their gun held to their eye shame your mom wouldnt let you play paintball or youd realize how impractical that is
  thats an awesome tip too bad i dont play light gun games
  not in that one there you have to move with the gun to dodge
what are some of the best snes games to play high
xenogears bruh
  mario paint  harvest moon  sim city    there are few more actually good for having trips but i forgot them sorry
  dude weed lmao
donkey kong kuntry
  take your degeneracy elsewhere potheads are the lowest form of life on earth
  yoshis island kirby in dreamland my personal favourites when blazin it up and playing snes
  super mario rpg would probably be a good jarpig to play blazed
  yoshis island chrono trigger ff6 f zero x megaman 4
    barack obama was a pothead and he is more successful than you will ever be in your entire life hypocrite
  fag
  cannabis consumption makes you suggestible enough to be chosen as the prime illuminati puppet    cool story bro
  smoke weed become interesting get picked as puppet president make millions and after 8 years of sham presidency never work another day in my life  or  dont and stay a literal nobody who is too afraid to take risks and die early knowing there was more in life i could have done  damn tough choice
no ultima general
play on a t2a server peasant
  excuse me
  op pic looks to be from a modern client with the gridded sorting of the backpack and other shit    basically too much shit t2a was simple and fun   well not t2a strictly but a few things removed and added improvements and systems that came after varying between freeshards
whats a paladin
  op doesnt even know what t2a is  playing nuuo  yikes
  i spent 14 years of my life playing this masterpiece every day nickname hullu akka shoutouts to all my true brit bros
  you have been a thorn in my side for far too long ultima 9 i banish you to the world of pagan no one here knows of electronic arts bwahahahaha
  im not entirely sure
  your knowledge of the land shall be great
the only thing there is to talk about is underworld ascendant and the only thing there to talk about about that is how buggy it is
  what is this shit the last time i ever logged in was around 2006 or 2007 and i dont even recognize it at all to think i went from hallywhack mage to all the awful ren era mage builds then enjoyed the total shit show in aos with the 4/6 casting 60 sdi wrecking people with a simple explode fs combo i finally quit when it got to the point of ridiculousness of elves and the archer madness although it was fun to 1 shot people with critical strike
  how do you feel when people cherish wow classic as the hardcore mmorpg
ok i started ultima 4 made a fighter and got shamino and mariah and went to britain  what the fuck do i do now im pretty fucking confused
  be good
  not him but it makes me laugh those fuckers never had to worry about people killing you and stealing everything you owned
i wish there was a good second age/renaissance server
  i was going to say uosecondage but a quick search reveals its really gone downhill
it is a miracle that uo still exits but no one gives a fuck anymore it is the kind of game that represents the most accomplished realization of a vision how many videogames let you throw things in the floor or let you choose a job unrelated to killing maybe it is still alive thanks to open source engines
  this
  i miss t2a good times were had back in 20082010  its a shame it died and that the devs wanted to keep it as a 100 pure uo game museum
  what the fuck do i do  not knowing anything is part of the fun in this game but yes it can be pretty confusing for a first time player    just walk around and explore talk to the townspeople they will give you hints on how to stay virtuous and how to progress on your path to avatarhood  be good and stay on the straight path  slay baddies where you find them but spare good monsters  abuse lord british for healing  avoid walkthroughs unless you get completely stuck somewhere
i played uo back in 1998 and had the time of my life it might be my very best gaming memories it was just so much fun    then in 2008 i tried ultima 3 on the nes and didnt understand a thing even the gameplay then i tried ultima 6 and got bored in under an hour because i had absolutely no idea what to do and there was way too much verbose for me  then i tried ultima underworld which was okay    mfw i actually love this series but its not for me and i just cant get into it because its too open
  i was considering getting underworldascendant but it got pretty bad reviews otoh the reviews i read were pretty sparse on detail anyone have actual hands on gameplay to talk about if it was good or bad
best way to enjoy ultima 7  what other games are recommended
you dont need a general on a slow board just make a thread
  best way to enjoy ultima 7  play it  what other games are recommended  part 2
  play 4 to 7 in order
  use the exult source port and install the music pack    also play 6 7 part two underworld and underworld 2
  pretty much grab a notebook and write key words and people that different npc would say you should be able to find you way to the ending by doing that as for combat just give everyone a sling and go to town sadly as great as ultima is regarding world building and npc dialog it always hate awful combat
  you want to know whats really cool  all that stuff you had on your account back in 1997 21 years ago is still on your account not once did they ever wipe anyones stuff or characters    its too bad uo is completely different now as one would expect after 21 years of service its not worth playing at all anymore
  its too bad uo is completely different now  yeah i tried it when it got the f2p mode recently and just looking at the paperdolls of other players just felt like it destroyed the atmosphere of the game with all the stuff they had
  yeah im so thankful for private servers  lets m log on once in a while to get that nostalgia trip big time    im still curious after all this time why ea never went after private servers wonder what kind of legal hole was going on where they wouldnt touch it
  im not sure especially since a lot of them were making a fair bit of money maybe they thought even if they shut them down it wouldnt bring in more customers since most of the servers were uor or t2a so it wasnt worth the time/money going after them
  when does ultima x come out
  thats bullshit give everybody a magic axe
imagine 
  i fucking loathe these people and ultima ruined every other videogame for me nothing compares
help me out ive never played ultima and im interested in getting into it     where should i start and what server or whatever should i go for first im also not that big of a fan of the graphics although wouldnt give a shit if the gameplay is engaging how hardcore is ultima compared to lets say diablo 2 or other mmos
  daguq is that diakatana is this what you do with your time playing faggy diakatana and posting pics of it for no reason on /vg/  im going to talk to your mom about getting a abortion
  forgot to add im strictly interested in the online games
whats the overall best series ever this or doom it has to be one of the 2 right
    the only online ultima is ultima online the series is the ultimate openworld series and mainly appeals to people who just want to do random shit in a massive open world with ludicrous levels of interactivity    ultima online can be played by downloading some shit and connecting to a private server or you can pay ea a monthly fee dont do that    its not a hard game at all but it attracts people who like to spend obscene amounts of time playing it
should i play the 1st trilogy or skip to 4
  playing 1 or 3 wont hurt you but you wont miss much by skipping them either  dont waste too much time on 2
  most people nowadays skip straight to 4 the sega master system port is the best version of it
  alright ill play them for a bit and if i like them ill finish them whats wrong with 2    why exactly
  whats wrong with 2  it was far too ambitious for richard garriotts skills to handle
  whats wrong with 2  the original plan was simply to make whats now 3 the sequel to 1 but there was a lot of acclaim for 1 back in the day and there was pressure at origin to make a new sequel asap so they wound up taking all of the castoff ideas from 1 that didnt make the cut slapping them together and calling it a game it was shit and it shows
  origin  origin was only created by lb due to his problems dealing with sierra online for u2
  youre right of course mea culpa
try and talk about metroid on /v/  get called a faggot while my thread gets spammed with porn and people saying omg i wanna remodel samus shithole    does /vr/ want to talk about metroid or are you just as far gone as those idiots on /v/
  this place is better but in the future dont even bother bringing up what retarded /v/rmin say/do
  noted for future threads anyway can we talk about romhacks of super here because its been a while and im not sure if /vr/ enforces vanilla or not
    want do you wanna talk about in metroid buddy
  romhacks are fine although i usually dont see people talk about anything beyond hyper metroid/project base
  whats your favorite romhack if you remade the game today would you make changes to it and was there really a point to the animals       im actually playing through quite a few id recommend super zero mission as its a nice reremake of zero mission ive heard nothing but good things about phazon and eris is a nice one too ive also wanted to get into the lttp/super metroid randomizer i hear thats a real humdinger of a double romhack
im the only one that he loves the exploration elements in the first zelda but cant stand the exploration in the first metroid
  zelda has landmarks that separate everything while the first metroid copies too many rooms its perfectly understandable
    whats your favorite romhack  ill be completely honest i dont usually play romhacks and i dont think ive ever played a super metroid romhack    if you remade the game today would you make changes to it  the only thing id probably change is making a difficulty setting a think a lot of people would have liked to play a harder version of super metroid    and was there really a point to the animals   of course there was a point to the animals they were cute and if you didnt save them you are probably a sociopath
  theres an entire romhack general and a randomizer general that are up from time to time as well
  whats your favorite romhack  
  whats your favorite romhack  recently finished ancient chozo it was great i am more of a expanded vanilla type super zero mission was great too but like others i found it way too difficult near the end
  /vr/ is just /v/ overflow these days
  i cant get into most of them they appeal to more dedicated crowd that performs some tricky moves perfectly and i always miss the beat trying to do bomb jump wall jumps are easy though there was a control hack that made the controls more like gba games i like that it makes poaying the game on psp or vita much better i also dont like hacks that fixes gravity i like the floaty jumps in super
  people saying omg i wanna remodel samus shithole  wow i didnt know i wanted to remodel samus shithole until i read this
  not even close
  im not boasting but /vr/ is miles better than /v/
  hyper metroid was really good i get shit sometimes for beating my dick over it too much hear but it really was good compared to other hacks ive played completed in 2015 too so its fairly new and very polished
  /v/  theres your problem right there the place is an unwiped anus
  guys on there just dont appreciate metroidvanias like super metroid as much as /vr/
    get stuck in the ending of the game  find out about the chaos beam to glitch out of the ending  game is broken anyway so it doesnt matter    rip my save file
only mildly retro but i am really happy that metroid 1 and 2 whichever way you decide to play 2 have been lifted up to the design standard of super played through the trilogy recently and really enjoyed myself
   cringe
    zero mission is linear handhloding garbage  samus returns isnt as good as the original despite the technology differences    plebeian
  is hyper worth playing or should i go with am2r  started playing metroid this year and already played all the mainline 2d games super twice in a row and i need more  my favourite is fusion
  this is probably an unpopular opinion on a retro board but samus returns is arguably the best 2d metroid gameplay wise the original game is shit compared to it
  i thought it was surprisingly good but still not on the level of super
  proving the point you disagree with  not boasting  get a load of this kid
  mein neger      is hyper worth playing or should i go with am2r  absolutely play both
can we talk about genociding fusion fans
  kys
    no you kill yourself you degenerate retard fusion fans are disgusting
  why is he a fusion fan if so i agree
  2d metroid  i dont see anything wrong with metroid 4
    i didnt say anything about metroid i said fusion for some reason it calls itself metroid fusion but really theyre not related at all
  i feel like i would have liked fusion if theyd called it anything else but as a metroid game its trash
    exactly lets genocide everyone that likes fusion
  i was just playing metroid and i made it through a missile button and to a room where the floor keeps breaking under me im not sure where to go
  shut up acfag
  i mean as much as i do want to wreck samus ass /vr/ is actual discussion its honestly what brought me to the metroidvania genre shit was pretty cash for my first play through of it in 07
  metroid 2 is better if you can get past the puke colors and small screen
  forced backtracking and shoehorning in ridley yeah no fuck the new ending
    not playing the fan remake  its only better when enhanced but not the actual remake fuck that one
what the actual goddamn fuck i spend fucking hours scouring every bloody part of this section even trying to get through the high heat parts without the varia suit what the fuck were they thinking making that random section only bombable
  metroid reuses a lot of room designs so it requires the player to be a lot more aware of how hes moving around the world in order to keep track of where he is and where hes been it can be a bit too demanding for people
  he  metroid is a chick
    he  metroid  perpetuating this meme is terrible
  i didnt like the optional ending so the entire game is shit  anyway ridley fight was pretty intense and the game is at least a little challenging  as a game is way less replayable than super though
    are you guys legitimately autistic the he in that sentence is referring to the player
  optional  how is it optional it seemed as you are escaping the planet ridley just decides to pop out of nowhere and block your path how could i have avoided fighting him
  you can stop playing after killing the queen and the backtracking was because of the linear map of the original  why are you complaining about more good content  seriously i cant understand everything is forced or arbitrary in videogames
  halo is a pretty cool guy      not accepting original nintendo canon as written on that tree stuff that people born before emulation read
  im not the anon that originally responded to you i enjoyed the ridley fight im just questioning how the fight was optional and im not seeing how its an optiona encounter if my other option is to stop playing
  ive used the wrong term sorry  i meant it was an extra compared to the original game and it just add content without ruining anything  also gives a reason to backtrack and get all the upgrades before fighting him
  i got one thing to say about super metroid i think this game is really ugly dont get me wrong this game is great legendary even easily in the top 10 of the 16bit era but all the good things this game does are entirely in the gameplay department   the graphics and soundtrack leave much to be desired i never understood superfags who go on about muh atmosphere muh isolation when i never really felt any kind of immersion from this title the one room with the bubbles is probably the worst looking room in the game and a perfect example of how this game suffers in the art department
  i swear the first time i beat metroid it took me around 60 hours of actual gameplay just going around forever lost and bombing everything
samus shithole status remodeled
  you can stop playing after killing the queen  lol just turn off the game before the end xd  fucking retard
  still salty because you cannot beat ridley sad
  i actually liked the ridley fight i just think that line of reasoning is fucking retarded optional content is content thats not required to complete to see the ending backtracking to get 100 items is optional because its not required to see the ending the ridley fight is nonoptional because you cannot see the ending without beating him defining optional content by the fact that a game can be turned off at any time is the dumbest thing ive ever heard
the best metroid threads on /v/ are ones where the discussion is not centered around samus
i want to suck and fuck kraid
  ive already said optional was the wrong word   can you stop being spergie about this pls  also how you are so triggered about me saying optional technically true nobody is forcing you to play the game until the end credits expecially if you didnt like it but not for the forced backtracking in  i was responding  have you ever considered that you are the retard maybe
  im in the process of actually beating super for the first timezero mission and prime are great i think i beat fusion but it was that forgettable and i dropped prime 2 at some pointi still have am2r on my plate but fuck the original and 2 they aged badly
  ive already said optional was the wrong word  okay but the sentence i quoted didnt even include that actual word it was    you can stop playing after killing the queen    which is still stupid logic the idea that someone shouldnt complain about a piece of content because no one forced them to continue playing the game is the death of critique and discussion    but not for the forced backtracking in  i was responding  while i agree that backtracking for 100 item completion is optional there is a bit of forced backtracking at the end in the sense that if you want to get 100 completion there are a number of items in the game that are hidden behind those crystals that you have to use the baby metroid to get past in order to get 100 completion you will have to beat the queen and then backtrack with the baby metroid in tow to get through those crystals    this is dumb for two reasons    1 heavy backtracking without gaining progress is lame backtracking in metroid usually serves to allow further progress in the game and when you backtrack theres often things you can find items rooms etc which you couldnt access the first time through the area backtracking with the baby metroid at the end of samus returns is just teleporting back and forth or circling the entire map a second time on an errand run before walking into the final ridley fight    2 by requiring you to have the baby metroid to get some of the items you are collecting a number of items after completing 99 of the content in the game already the only fight left at that point is ridley and getting extra power bombs for example will not even help you in that fight the items that require the baby metroid arent even difficult to get to and dont even offer a challenge like some other items do they literally just involve walking over to the crystals letting the baby eat them and walking over to the item to pick it up
  sr endgame is a bit boring and useless i think nobody is arguing about this still its basically a problem inherited by the linear nature of the original game and doesnt seem to me a reason to disregard the entire game that overall had good gameplay ideas freeaim mapping system eon powers and few rough edges melee counter enemy variety that let me hope for a good metroid 5  i personally enjoyed backtracking everytime i got a new power it was not a total chore thanks to teleports and map annotations and after killing the queen i stopped playing for about a week so the next session i got all the powerups as a warmup and then killed ridley
  sure its no reason to disregard the game entirely but its still a weakness of the game that deserves criticism i think they should have done one of two things either redesign the map to be less linear and more like super metroid or just go allin with the linearity and faithful map and mostly not require backtracking for items in the first place    good backtracking design in a metroid game is what i call abac backtracking which is where you go from point a to point b to get a power up then back to point a to use the new power to continue to point c the second trip to point a gives you a chance to use new powers to uncover items you couldnt get before then you ultimately move forward on a new path to a new area you couldnt access before this kind of backtracking feels rewarding because youre frequently uncovering new things and new paths forward and new areas    what samus returns does and a lot of other subpar metroidvanias do is a lot of abab backtracking where you go from point a to point b to get a power up then back to point a to use the new power to uncover an item you couldnt get before then head back to point b to continue progressing forward from exactly where you left off this kind of backtracking feels like a slog and a grind because youre just running back and forth on an existing path rather than running back to go forward on a new path    i like samus returns overall but the item placement and backtracking were very lazily implemented in a way that can quickly turn the game into a grind if you want to get all or even most of the items
  i think you might just have shit taste the soundtrack is outstanding    also the bubble tiles are a throwback to the previous two games i actually wish theyd used that tileset more because it looks cool
  the animals serve as a sign of samuss humanity and allows her to have some sort of redemption by the end of the story super metroid is about samus trying and failing to reclaim a life that she had shown pity on in the past while the baby metroid ultimately dies samus is able to receive some closure by saving the animals its a narrative catharsis that only further emphasizes the pathos created by the baby metroid
      the reality is that this is the only discussion left about this 20 year old game  metroid 3 super metroid is really good i personally prefer the nes games atmosphere and difficulty and lack of map memorize landmarks but super is really undeniably fucking good  my favorite rom hack is hyper metroid followed by phazon sorry for pleb taste        based and hyperpilled
  i would except one of them is my exgf and im still not over her but yeah fusion is way too linear for my tastes it isnt a terrible game in the line of games that came after it are though
  am2r  gameboy version  samus returns    actually any other metroid 2 remake is probably better desu
  call me a faggot but i find zero suit samus so fucking boring and ive never understood the appeal woo its a lady in a skintight suit never seen one of those in a scifi setting before   her armoured suit is to this day still an iconic design even in an age where robots and mechs are a diamond dozen
  i played it through one time with a map but that was years ago now im excited to play through it with no map to guide me someday soon cause i really cant remember anything now gonna be fun
  thats how its supposed to be just pure exploration
you uh ever tonguepunch the fartbox of a chozo like a prison bitch
  agreed 100
  zero mission itself is total crap
i am at a loss since the metroid 2 remakes  i feel super is still the most ambitious 2d entry and ii is still the one with the best horror vibe but i dig the fluid controls from both am2r and even sr  maybe i should try that zm hack recreating super
xfusion hack when
  ive also wanted to get into the lttp/super metroid randomizer  come check out the randomizer general /rng/ sometime we talk lttp/sm crossover sometimes and theres also tons of discussion about super metroid arcade
  halo is a pretty cool guy  eh shoots aleins and doesnt afraid of anything
  oh hey and im retarded forgot the link  
samus shouldve never been a woman it attracted too many waifu kids to the fandom and it pushed the games to become weeb fanservice metroid works best when you discard samus as a character entirely and the game treats her like a robot    wwell that would ruin metroid    better for it to lose something than to have discussions constantly ruined by people spamming i want to remodel samus shithole no cost too great
    i actually downloaded super metroid arcade and currently im scouring the internet for a japanese rom of super and lttp since i believe those are the requirements for the double rom randomizer it sucks too because i went through the process of legally obtaining both games and making sure to get the roms only to find that i have the wrong versions    disappointing desu
why does old wrpg have such bad combat i know people will argue but it is always the thing that stops me from playing more than a couple of hours in a game i get why most tries to do a top down srpg because of table top gaming but it always feel like it never plays right wizardry is the only system i felt got it right and doesnt frustrate me really sucks too because outside of combat the games are almost always fantastic with lots dialog options tons of areas to explore puzzles to solve actual roleplaying
which games in particular are you talking about wizardry a big part of the combat in the old wizardry games is actually in the preparation  the way you build your party your configuration of classes classchanging the accumulation of skills and items the combat especially in the earlier wizardry games can be simpler than later rpgs but the character development is still some of the best especially in 6 7 and 8    check out wizardry 4 gaiden  throb of the demons heart it adds a lot of the developments from the later series to the old school wizardry formula and longrange weaponry which can make the back rows much more interesting its a great game thats been translated to english now and worth checking out if youre having a hard time getting into that older rpg format
  games like ultima where they tried to have a top down grid system like dd but it just ends with you slinging rocks at the enemy i just never could enjoy most wrpg combat that tried to do more than just turn base
might  magics combat is also fun and fastpaced
  maybe i should check that out but arent they just wizardry like combat
  pretty much but theres optional real time combat in the later games 678
  no mm has directly executed actions while wizardry has planning your turn ahead
  having just played a bit of the old champions of krynn add game i would say the main issue is the primitive interface it basically feels designed by a programmer who did his best and while there are a variety of nice features its still clunky as fuck  cant see the whole battle field  only way to move camera appears to be to move a targeting icon  taking any action requires multiple keypresses through a menu  confusing terms that appear to mean the same thing but actually do different things like quit and exit  lack of feedback   for example if you try to shoot a ranged weapon at an enemy but cant because theres an enemy standing next to you the game lets you proceed all the way to the point where you select a target but when you hit enter the cursor just resets with no message or anything  feedback that does appear flies by extremely quickly  at low levels rngbased dd gameplay is fucking boring to do on a computer  in the very second combat scenario there was at least one point where every single attacker on both sides missed for 3 rounds in a row its really effing annoying to have to select 3 menu options to attack only to miss for 6 fucking characters in a row for 3 rounds in a row     not having to loot every single corpse individually is nice but the menu system is still terrible allocating loot takes a ton of going back and forth between menus memorizing spells is a huge pain trading equipment is awkward youre expected to refer to the manual for stuff like weapon properties in fact portions of the game text are in the printed manual and the game will say read journal entry 37 instead of displaying it in game this is a huge hassle
try some real time dungeon crawlers like dungeon master or lands of lore
  why does old wrpg have such bad combat  its literally just dd are you saying thats too much for you to handle
  not him but like he said on games like ultima it makes combat too long and boring i guess the transition didnt go so well its okay on table top because you know its gonna take a while but every random battle taking that much is a bitch i guess thats why the wizardry system is the best since you dont have to bother moving the characters
  you can avoid combat in ultima  have you played any games beyond ultima
  maybe properly learning english will let you actually enjoy the games    might  magic world of xeen is pretty rad
  cuz ur gey kek
  kek owned
  ask the japs they seem to love wizardry in all its shitty combat glory
  wizardrys combat is good because of all the systems surrounding it if you remove those you get bog standard boring ass jrpg combat
  the problem isnt whats removed but what is added  combat should be quick not slowed down by attack animations or sounds
  oh i can agree with that i just think if you also remove resource management limited spellcasting item carry capacity it also makes combat less interesting and more of a brainless chore
  another thing is the combat frequency in wiz you mainly have fixed room encounters with enemies with a random encounter during movement every once in a while  many later games forgo the room concept and just increase the rate for walking encounters
  been playing through world of xeen on my phone using magic dosbox to pass time at hospital holy shit its amazing at making time just disappear
  have you played modern wrpgs they dont have good combat either
  fuck off with this lowhanging fruit dude really ancient influential game is bad bullshit youll never be youtubes next angry videogame faggot
why do so many people keep shitting on early 3d games but lavish and praising 2d games all the time
  early 3d is ugly i say that as someone who has been playing a shitload of n64 games this week
because sprite graphics are aesthetically pleasing while polygon graphics are ugly early has nothing to do with it most polygon games look ugly to this day
  they werent ready to move to 3d for home consoles
  you picked a racing game for the op which are moreorless required to have at least semidecent 3d for every example of good early 3d you find there are at least 10 other bad examples
  it looks like shit while 2d looks decent how hard is that to get
  2d looks decent now   it looks grainy with shitty color banding and dithering everywhere
  higher resolution than the actual game on ps1  hmm
it certainly needs praise 3d is more exciting to the brain than 2d but things done in 2d are usually more artistic
few people care about early 2d games with some standout examples same as early 3d ones though with early 3d they suffer from garbage framerates awful cameras shit controls wonky collission detection and more 2d ones are very simple and theres no room to colossally fuck things up
  have you not played many early 2d games
  not really sprite scaling is pretty much the coolest thing ever and nothing in any polygon game compares
  usually pong or space invaders clones dont have much room to fuck up you mixed up zoomer child
  sure i played lots of early to mid 80s arcade games
  pong and space invaders are way earlier 2d than the 5th generation is to 3d you projecting little fuck
i think early 3d looks pretty good actually it has its own interesting minimalist aesthetic    i dont care about framerates or whatever the fuck outside of arcade ports it is irrelevant
  youre right the atari 2600 is probably a better comparison
  early 3d looked like shit dude
  early 3d  rrt4  retard
  ps1 was capable of widescreen
early 3d were new and as a result offer cumbersome     meanwhile 2d games had been there forever and devs had mastered their design    for instance i have more fun playing 2nd rate 2d fps released in 1998 like redneck rampage rides again than 3d fps released in 1998 and praised at the time like shogo
  yeah but that shogo engine turned out to be a real gem later down the line
early 3d can look good but it needs to be heavily minimalistic or stylized
  redneck rampage rides again  you would be autistic enough to call that 3d game 2d
  if we associated retro 2d games with atari wed probably shit all over them too of course early 3d looked bad its not a fair comparison
  but redneck rampage is 3d    and shogo is better
  true but people are faggots and those who say but le 2d is le aesthetic etc they dont play games either theyre just a bunch of faggots who played metroid once in an emulator 5 years ago and take gay pictures of their mario coffee mug to post on kikebook instakike or something like that    so really fuck those people they now cant stand ps1 3d games ps2 3d games ps3 3d games and likely in the future theyll hate ps4 3d games too
the animations most early 3d games had poor animation compared to contemporary 2d games enemies dont react properly to attacks walking movement looks robotic its why nobody criticizes 3d racing games
  the little camera guy sprite on the platform on phantomile  neat never noticed him before
  love playing early 3d games  its got the perfect balance of old and new
at the time of playing early 3d really captured my imagination with titles like star wars shadows of the empire and goldeneye     of course if you compare to current 3d it looks dated
  because theyre shit despite what youtube told you to think
  cuz ur gay lmao
  because the point at where those intersect was when spritebased artwork had reached a prime while 3d graphics were just getting off the ground
    early 3d is aesthetic af
blue and rouge are the same person and blue is the evil personality is that correct
blue did nothing wrong
general saga thread    im playing 2 and about to do the termite cave my mage is at 1 lp though should i kill him off and get a new recruit beforehand is that a good strategy for near permadeath characters
  not quite blue and rouge were originally a single fetus that got divided into twins with definite identities by the scientist in the magic kingdom to bypass the limitation of opposite magic schools nullifying each other  blue and rouge have distinct personalities despite being two parts of a whole so saying that one is the good part and the other is the evil one is reductive as theyre still different people when separated blouge is essentially a walking paradox made to cheat the system so its one person but at the same time its two when separated theyre blue and rouge when theyre united theyre neither hence the nickname blouge and why blouge doesnt really understand whether hes blue or rouge  they tend to be represented with yin yang simbology but the fact that theyre opposites in terms of personalities isnt really indicative of them being a definite part of a whole think of it as a fusion from dragon ball really    should i kill him off and get a new recruit beforehand  might as well if you dont want to risk getting a broken formation mid battle
saga frontier 1 is underrated ive seen sf2 criticized for being much more linear with a dumbed downnbattle systrm can someone confirm    once i learned sf1 system i cant get enough of it trying diff monsters and playing with diff setups is fire
    a question just what the hell are the regions are they basically islands in some ether ala the worlds in flash gordon
  sf2 is not quite linear its divided into clear chapters or episodes  you do not have any input in how the story develops outside of one minor chapter but you can progress through it in a non chronological order and even skip certain chapters if you want to meaning the game still allows nonlinear progression in its own unique way  with a dumbed downnbattle systrm  the battle system isnt dumbed down if anything its a more polished and slightly more complex version of frontiers battle system since theres new mechanics like channeling roles and cross combos  the main differences between frontier and frontier 2 is that frontier 2 has no races different weapons types frontier uses the gb saga weapon design while frontier 2 uses the romancing weapon design and theres four party members instead of five frontier 2 also features an alternate battle mode called duel mode unique to this entry together with a few other mechanics  frontier 1 is an elaboration and homage to the original gb trilogy while using the multiple mc structure from the romancing trilogy while frontier 2 is somewhat a reverse being focused on the mechanical standards of the romancing trilogy while adopting a slightly more orthodox jrpg structure similar to the gb trilogy    are they basically islands in some ether ala the worlds in flash gordon  pretty much theyre worlds floating in what you might call a dimensional sea
  you will never get to play fuses chapter and hang out with your irpo comrades    feels bad imagine an sf1 remaster with all the cut content restored and fleshed out as it was originally meant to be
i get heavy vaporwave vibes from saga frontier
  pretty much theyre worlds floating in what you might call a dimensional sea    uhcan you fall into said sea i notice manhattans infrastructure does not have much in terms of safety
  imagine an sf1 remaster with all the cut content restored and fleshed out as it was originally meant to be  oh i can imagine it i wish squenix could also not just imagine it but make it real and announce it next year given how every fan is salivating for it since rs3 got its remaster  i fucking hate this incompetent company    its because its aesthetic is unapologetically 90s as fuck    uhcan you fall into said sea  sure tanzer lives in it even  dont ask me what happens to you when you do though  frontiers world also has some other particular regions that are apparently disconnected from the general world structure and therefore not connected to the dimensional sea and reachable by region ships margmel kirins and time lords region being some of those
    also if you ever bring up blues magic map you see the whole of the system including its sun in the center think of it as all floating in a atmosphere that behaves like a sea
  looking forward to an official english rs3 and scarlet grace at least ive beaten rs3 to hell and back but i will buy it to keep the interest level up as much as i can scarlet grace is what i really need    sf1 remains my favorite of the series though with rs2 a close 2nd and rs3 trailing a little behind that probably saga 1 and 2 rounding out the top 5 aabeta and bokuno make me want to learn moonrunes though holy shit    saga frontier 1 with sketch motion battles imagine
  saga frontier 1 with sketch motion battles imagine  would be the absolute best way to remake the game but it will never happen pretty sure theyll keep scarlet graces visual style when it comes to modelling maybe theyll give it a filter similar to atelier games to keep the watercolour aesthetic from tomomis art and call it a day  unless of course squenix actually pours some budget into the game which will never fucking happen at this rate
  yeah im certainly not holding my breath we have to take what we can get to some extent as weird as that rs2 port was at first its fine now i was surprised they even bothered with english at all    i just hope that the sales of these are good enough to suggest that they should do something with sf1
  decided to give up and try to find a different quest the termite queen kills my party in two hits usually goes first and resists most of my stuns even with two characters attempting per turn
    evil may be a bit much but hes clearly the asshole personality
    man why couldnt they have cut rikkis story that whole thing was awful
  if you embrace the classic monster eating from the original saga its okay its the only thing in the game that deals with ring lord too iirc
    yeah nah fuck rikis stupid quest
  final boss was cool though a challenge for a change
salsa frontier sucks
    opinions
  his story is good and the focus on monsters and the ring lord story is well done id rather have them cut lutes story at that point since he adds nothing of worth and hes overshadowed by gen in his own story at least coon/riki does feel like a protagonist and has his own story lute is just a very weak protagonist with a story that ends up being developed more in other mcs scenario than his own the only thing of worth in his own scenario is recruiting captain hamilton and learning that lutes father and mondo were fellow revolutionaries oh and the spriggan being a fucking cool mecha    eh its a mobage  its going to be mechanically alright when it comes to battles unless they fuck up like they with imperial and give everyone their own oc waza while making any endgame content a battle of endurance that is solved with the same exact strategy but in the end it will still be a mobage will all that it entails  pretty curious about some of the original characters especially zenon since hes an ausbach like mikhail and monica the world is based around rs3 this time around so some of those original stories might be fun as for characters interaction if theyre keeping up the good job from imperial theyre probably going to be entertaining as well theres also a new cool blue lobster character for boston to interact with    iirc kawazu also got kazuko shibuya back to do the sprites for everyone which is good
  rikis ending was fantastic
there was an anon some time ago who asked for a jp iso of minstrel song theres one on nyaa that actually works just got it myself today just search for romancing saga theres two files the one you want is in all caps
  ring lord is gay
    create a saga that ties all saga together make silky hat aka god into the last boss
  no pc    fukthem
  god is literally the final boss of makai toushi saga already
what are the best evangelion games
girlfriend of steel for visual novels  pic related for actual video game adaptation of the series in fact this is still the best evangelion game to this day  only for eva fans though
for how much merchandise eva has in japan im surprised it didnt get more video games
anyone else pissed on how sony keeps betraying the console that made them    such an iconic system and yet this is the treatment its getting
  just emulate lmao
  theyre a company  you think they care about anything but aking money at least least effort possible  or that they have feelings towards their customers  theyre all the same
its a quick cash grab thrown together with the most easily accessible resources  you can kinda already play psx games on like fifty devices anyway
not saying anyone here is doing this specifically but its baffling to see the internet get up in arms about le input lag memes on the ps1 classic because some faggy site reported they felt lag but conveniently didnt specify which tv they were using  i wont defend the game selection lack of shaders or lack of dualshock because all of those things are shit but input lag come on now
  its hard to make money with a shitty product
    they dont give a fuck about you or your gaystation lovin friends
  depends on your audience
has it been    hacked    yet
has any reviewer determined if the controllers work with windows
  remember ronco they pulled it off for a few decades
    the console they are launching is literally an emulator i think i read somewhere that the source code its actually form a mobile emulator
  you may not agree with the game selection but there are others that love it different tastes do exist
  if it is an emulator it would be the one in their xperia play cellphone or the psp no way it is the ps2/ps3 emulator
  people felt lag because they were playing the 50hz version while being accustomed for the 60hz its not actually confirmed whether theres actual input delay with the emulation it cannot possibly be worse than what the ps3 had though
  rumor states it is pcsx rearmed we shall see
  its a branch of pcsxr an opensource emulator and while its an avangarde project which introduced great features its not the best in terms of accuracy      no way it is the ps2    ps2 didnt emulate the ps1
  shit man just hook it up to your computer and upload the psx roms same thing with the nes and snes classic
  its no rumour go watch the gb quick look
no one cares about this except bandwagoners who cant stand the thought of anything other than an hdmi cable for their retro game systems to show their fellow hipster friends there is no excuse for wanting to pay 100 for an emubox ps1 emulator with first gen controllers when you can get a working and probably modchipped ps1 for 20 scart for 20ish or official svideo cables for 10 a power cord for 5 and two dual shock controllers for 30 you can even throw in a gameshark for another 20 or the mouse controller for 1520 so instead of getting an emubox with 20 games and two controllers you could have had the real system with two better controllers all cables and a gameshark or the mouse for the same price
  do they actually show that is what it is i shall return
get psio
they really shouldve made this the pstv in a new shell with the games it comes with and a simple interface to buy classics off of psn dumb move desu
  anyone else an angsty little faggot  yes not me but many others are
  this desu
  pcsxr is pretty good imo the only problems i think it has imo are sound problem inconsistencies i think its a unique emulator though
  ps3 and psp did
  who was arguing that
  simple interface to buy classics off of psn  im honestly surprised this wasnt implemented or at least some simple way to add classics youve already bought to it
  go back to 4chan faggot
  id still say there are some companies that have a bit honor in the the products and history that they have id say that nintendo for example at least got the emulation right for their mini if they rip you off they do it with style
im very lucky to own all the ps1 games i would ever want featured in a miniconsole plus i can emulate them all to get the highest possible graphical output      this novelty would have been the perfect opportunity to feature the games that cost an arm and a leg to track down like symphony of the night and klonoa and marvel vs capcom      it just seems really out of touch and arrogant its also very clear how much nintendo is concerned with delivering a quality product
  pal  disgusting
    this is the only pal psx game worth owning
    pal
  wrong nostalgia sells on its own and companies consistently prove that they dont need to put in any effort at all just look at pokémon lets go  its a 60 switch remake of pokémon yellow that has the same graphics as the 3ds games while actually removing features from the game its remaking like the safari zone     if you have an established fanbase you can sell literally anything to them and make money because hardcore fans have no standards
  thats just nintendo nintendo could defecate into a box and nintendrónes would buy it
  pal versions    lol
  say that to apple
  who the fuck cares sony was always a shitty company that just happened to get some great games on its systems you expect way too much from a corporation
  get psio  wait a year until it ships  cut traces  solder shit  yeap
  i wish they had added the texture smoothening feature of the ps2 and ps3     and i get that they have to spend fuckloads in licenses to get use of games like ffvii but i would have liked to also see sony properties like legend of dragoon as well as oddities like raystorm castlevania sotn a tr game and mdk    legend of dragoon is one of the best jrpgs of that gen and sony owns it wholly so it costs them nothing to use it yet they left it out i dont get it
perhaps this needs to be seen to be believed
  does it necessarily mean that they use the whole pcsx and not just some of its parts
  what is vib ribbon
  it seems unlikely to me that they spent any time finetuning the emulation given how barebones the whole package is
  ps2 didnt emulate the ps1  it semidid actually
  lack of dualshock  i still dont get this complaint  if the included games were different maybe but rumbles a meme 3/4 of these titles dont support sticks and the ones that do arent greatly improved by their use
  people where pissed about it not being a dualshock when the thing was announced because they knew that it would limit the games that would be on it people are probably still pissed for the same reason if it had been a dualshock then they might have had better games than the shit they actually included its just one issue among many that points to the whole thing being a lazy cash grab
  mobile emulator  no its one of the best but not the best psx emulators    no it isnt and you niggers still cant say why those are better than an open source emulator  did the psp have savestates  anyway nobody should buy this shit sony is cheaping too much no putting dualshocks on a 100 emulator it should try harder next time
  asians cant feel
pcsx  pal versions  i dont understand how they fucked up this badly it probably would have been cheaper to just throw pstv parts preloaded with ntsc ps1 classics into a new shell with a new gui
whats the problem with pal games
cant play crash bandicoot on ps1 classic  can play it and nearly every other ps1 game on my hacked snes classic    i see no reason to spend 100 for this piece of shit
  theyre a company  you think they care about anything but aking money  redpilled
  you mean besides obvious 50 hz
  fat models of the ps2 pretty much wholly run ps1 in hardware rather than emulation it has a genuine mips 3000a cpu onboard and the ps2s gpu is directly compatible with the ps1 gpu
    50hz isnt the issue its the companies making lazy ports and not correcting the speed of the games to compensate luckily not an issue anymore    that being said some pal games are easier to emulator for that reason and i assume that would be why they got included    also tekken was the game reviewers where complaining about which while i cant confirm the pal release is slower than the ntsc release tekken as always felt like it was laggy and like it played underwater    also anyone know if the usb controllers are getting sold separately
    you can tell following these threads who is economically illiterate when they honestly believe because you can buy some guys ratty worn out used playstation for 20 off craigslist that somehow sourcing parts and manufacturing a brand new console should be cheaper than that yes sony might be padding the cost a bit compared to the nintendo minis but until i see what  square and konami demanded for just the ff7 and mgs licenses alone i wont judge them ive also seen sony advertising this thing hard on tv and what not which shows they are not treating this as some afterthought when did you ever see a tv ad for the nes mini if anything theyre trying too hard when nintendo relied on wordofmouth
it doesnt come with the power cable    just let that sink in they were too fucking cheap to include it
watching sony shit in their most loyal followers mouths so much theres a weird cantlookaway quality to it
         please do not bully me i have to live in a pal region whats your excuse for getting pal games in the ps classic
  to be fair you can actually get them at dollar stores now its not 2006 anymore
  the nintendo game cube wii wii u and switch would like to have a word with you
  hipsters    no this is for normies angry hipster will go on gook cartoon forums and post things like   no one cares about this except bandwagoners who cant stand the thought of anything other than an hdmi cable for their retro game systems to show their fellow hipster friends there is no excuse for wanting to pay 100 for an emubox ps1 emulator with first gen controllers when you can get a working and probably modchipped ps1 for 20 scart for 20ish or official svideo cables for 10 a power cord for 5 and two dual shock controllers for 30 you can even throw in a gameshark for another 20 or the mouse controller for 1520 so instead of getting an emubox with 20 games and two controllers you could have had the real system with two better controllers all cables and a gameshark or the mouse for the same price
  its also very clear how much nintendo is concerned with delivering a quality product    explain every console after the n64 then
  no its one of the best but not the best psx emulators  well technically pcsx is the emu pcsxrearmed is the version optimised for arm mobile architectures
  how were those consoles not a quality product the gamecube was impressively compact had reasonably good performance for its time and was physically durable    the wii was aesthetic in its stand came with innovative features like motion controls which were poorly implemented in many games but some games did use it properly metroid prime 3 etc unlike the 360 it actually came with built in wifi which is pretty good for the time    wii u i agree was a bit dodgy but technically speaking its not as bad as many people make out at its time of release it was literally the most powerefficient home gaming device on the market which obviously many people didnt give a shit about but nintendo assumed would be something energyconscious japanese players would like    switch has kinda dodgy build quality but the mobile graphics are pretty good nintendo went with the best solution available on the market i know a lot of people were bitching that they didnt go with the tegra version 2 chip but at that time it was only available for cars not for mobile devices
  arent all classic console editions just emulators and roms the nes classic isnt running original hardware is it
     are you suggesting postn64 consoles were shoddy where would you like me to begin     i think this guy has justified the gamecube      and i dont really need to justify the ds as that was also an amazing leap forward for handheld gaming     perhaps you want me to justify the wii a blue ocean console that seemed a lot more stable than its contemporaries plagued with the red ring of death or difficulttodevelopfor cell technology     maybe you want me to justify the wiiu a poorly timed console that was hurt by the adoption of smart phones and the introduction of the ipad but the only console of this generation that has embedded social features that actually got used and were enjoyable to use
no parappa the rapper  no symphony of the night  no ape escape  because theres no dualshock  no tomb raider  no gran turismo  no silent hill  no parasite eve  no tony hawks pro skater  no crash bandicoot  not even crash team racing  no spyro the dragon either  pal versions in an ntsc country  emulation quality is fucking shit because the thing too damn weak    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  its running a first party emulator it isnt a recoded snes9x
  i seriously dont understand why they didnt include sotn that and darkstalkers is the only reason i even got a ps1 also where the fuck are the good fighting games
     konami blue balled them contra isnt on the nes classic either
    yeah nintendo was garbage from the gc on each of these consoles offered the least amount of exclusives due to nintendos hostility to third party developers leading to them having the smallest libraries of their generation especially if you didnt want to buy the same tired ips rehashed yet again the gamecube lacked the software features that sony and microsoft had i mean they didnt even put in online functionality  they expected individual publishers to pick up the slack and set it up themselves classic nintendo developer hostility    the wii was a system sold on a gimmick not only was it the weakest graphically of its generation it had the worst home media interface like gamecube the worst online out of the three consoles and sold on the whole waggle stick gimmick     the wiiu was a mess from start to finish theres a 2000 word limit on posts so ill just summarize by saying theres a reason it was panned by almost everyone but the most diehard nintendo fanboys a lot of people didnt even realize it was a separate console from the originals wii but thats more of a marketing issue than anything    and that brings us to the switch a console that innovates nothing  it tries to move units based on a gimmick pretty much having an ipad with 720p you can take in public thats it no exciting new ips or anything of that nature its nintendo being lazy and resting on their laurels if a new company tried to float the switch you know it would have failed nostalgia is the only thing keeping this company alive not innovation
  pal versions in an ntsc country  y tho who decided this
  release something for only the most autistic of collectors  do the one thing that would set off their autism like no tomorrow   its like watching a trainwreck in slow motion
  if you have an established fanbase you can sell literally anything to them and make money because hardcore fans have no standards  the hardcore fans have standards look at how hard /vp/ is shitting on lets go its dumb hipsters that never cared about the product until it became cool to nostalgiafag over it that have no standards
  being so angry you post the equivalent of no u  you /v/irgins enjoy your subpar shit
  plgep is a lot of fun though shame about the lack of post game content and bugged online
  t buttblasted segafag
  the wii was a system sold on a gimmick  not really it was genuinely trying to make gaming more accessible and also experiment with better control methods the wii remote worked well for shooters    not only was it the weakest graphically of its generation  it was cheaper though and had perfect backwards compatibility    it had the worst home media interface  both the wii and 360 used dvds actually the wii dvds stored more data because the 360 dvds had some kind of shitty security system which consumed a lot of disk space
  this is a really ironic statement on a videogame forum   this but unironically
  after the snes you mean    buy the remake 
  seconded could be a decent gamepad for emulation
  a lot of these are because of recent or planned remakes at the time of development
   quality is fucking shit because the thing too damn weak  i dont understand how this is a thing i can run about 75 of ps1 games perfectly on this are you telling me the ps1 classic is weaker than the snes classic how did they fuck it up so bad
they really could have shipped it with ds3s instead of making replica ps1 controllers
  or at least offer compatibility wouldnt have taken much effort to stick a bluetooth receiver in there  but muh accuracy  that was thrown out the window when they used pcsx
  wanting parappa on a hd screen through this emulator probably 50hz  youve got some weird desires anon
vibribbon is only available in 50hz in english because it never released in us
  how much effort would it take to repack the european iso in ntscj at 60hz
im not even sure of the point of one of these ps2 and ps3 run playstation 1 games directly off the disks and im pretty sure all these games can be downloaded off the sony store    this isnt like nintendo where they refuse to sell their old games in bundles like say sega does
twisted metal 1 chosen over twisted metal 2 for nostalgia  meanwhile they included tekken 3 which isnt on the ps store due to the gon character licensing yet its on here not a complaint but it supplements the above  couldnt be bothered to pay activision for crash and/or spyro licenses to include at least one of the games  some games are 50hz pal versions to compensate for the systems performance  no power adapter included nintendo does the same but they expect you to have a 5v 2a usb ac adapter already i guess  controllers are probably nonstandard usb hids and would require drivers to work elsewhere  refactored open source emulator chosen when they could have used their existing closedsource emulation software from the ps vita or psp even which can handle most if not all ps1 titles  inexpensive poorperforming systemonachip chosen instead of refactoring the ps vitas hardware and reusing the alreadydeveloped emulation software  super puzzle fighter ii probably chosen as filler    the list can go on is there legitimately any reason to purchase this other than consumer loyalist reasons and nostalgia
japan gets the best version besides having better games they probably have ntscj version of tekken 3 and resident evil
  is there legitimately any reason to purchase this other than consumer loyalist reasons and nostalgia  no every mini console is only good as a present for a kid but this one is too expensive  anyway except the lineup this console is as bad as a snes mini your pic is not retro and your list is shit   opensource emulator is better than proprietary and you listed the problem twice   the soc is at least powerful as the snes mini probably more as snes mini cannot emulate every psx game   i dont get how the inclusion of tekken 3 is bad who cares about ps store do you really pay for digital copies   pal games have increased resolution i need a source about ntsc ones requiring less powerful hardware   at least controllers are usb and not some snowflake standard and the driver if needed will be included in linux in not time i dont care about wincucks
  pal games have increased resolution    they do not pal the video standard has higher resolution means nothing if the video game assets were not designed for it which they certainly werent in any game developed in japan or america
the irony is people will just mod it like the ps1
  1gb of memory   16gbs of flash storage
  emulation quality is fucking shit because the thing too damn weak  from what i have read the hardware is fine they just screwed up the emulation
  seems like mainly for the cute case and being able to buy a brand new boxed ps1 you can get a ps3 for the same price from the videos i saw there was extra slow down in rr type 4 that wasnt a severe on a real ps1 but it could be because a crt makes it look smoother
its good enough for casuals which is the target demo
  means nothing if the video game assets were not designed for it which they certainly werent in any game developed in japan or america  games like crash bandicoot use a higher resolution in pal territories though and they were usa produced
  they obviously want us to hack it and add games on it
no complete collection of net yaroze games as a bonus title  the entire thing seems totally halfarsed incredibly disappointing
  parasite eve being jap exclusive is annoying as well seems like a missed opportunity to give it to pal audiences that missed out a la ff3/6 on the snes classic
    normies dont even know what the fuck a net yaroze is
  even nintendo went out of their way and released a finished version of star fox 2 on their snes mini
  a ds4 is cheaper than wasting 100 bucks on this pos for just the controller
  yeah they do they know it as that rare blue psx thats worth thousands of dollars
  never ever
the df retro video breakdown of this thing is brutal as fuck  what were they thinking i know making a quick buck leeching off nintendos new fad
  implying you need to be autistic to feel the pal slow down and added frame judder caused by the shitty emu  implying the use of pal games is only flaws to set off autists
  keeps betraying the console that made them  ps4 is literally the only sony console unable to play ps1 games the ps1 classic sucks but lets not pretend they have some sort of long history neglecting the ps1
  i braced for the worst i wasnt disappointed    meditek soc  50hz games chosen because emulator cant run them at 60fps/30fps  50hz games running at 60hz anyway causing frame stuttering everywhere  doesnt matter because 60hz games suffer slowdown too  gta literally runs at 10fps  inaccurate sound emulation  visual glitches caused by other emulation inaccuracies  locked 720p  forced dither filter that adds blur on every single game    and sony have the nerve to charge way more for this than either nintendo microconsole
    just watched it lol seems like a bad day for gaystation friends    
  or that they have feelings towards their customers  theyre all the same    sony has that extra bit of sheer incompetence and overt psychopathy going
  wtf the gamecube was good
i think the most confusing part here is that sonys already released a tiny home console that plays playstation games flawlessly    its the ps tv and its almost five years old by now it also came bundled with a superior ds3    surely they couldve just repurposed that shit instead of producing new hardware that doesnt work right at all
  boomer nip salarymen whove never played a videogame in their lives
  the gamecube was the worst choice of its generation nintoddler we genuinely pitied gamecube kids growing up id rather stick with a n64 than deal with the half assed cash ins on that failed console
  that would actually take more effort because they would have to dummy out all of the code involving nonpsx games config etc the mini though is like slap freeware binaries and isos onto a chip and go eat lunch kind of cheap
  at least you have skullmonkeys
  they made the ps tv to get rid of the vita parts they had when they realized it was a faillure why would they produce more now  dont expect quality from sony theyre in for the money nowadays and the ps4s success showed that they were right
  boomer nip salarymen  theyve relocalized their videogame activities in fucking california
ok so what people dont like about the playstation classic is the limited amount of games on it the fact theres no ac adapter included the kinds of games that are included the fact it runs on an emulator so its more or less something you pay for that you might as well can download for free and you have to rely on something else to add other games and all in all its more or less a novelty or something to scalp/hoard/show off or whatever    ok but what makes that different from say the nes and snes classic what does that make it different from the commodore mini that also got released a while ago and while were at it even the aforementioned examples i just mentioned came in existence much later than those cheap megadrives and atari things theyve sold in stores for ages in short why is everybody on the internet so mad about the playstation classic if all those bad things were just as much a problem as with earlier releases and i dont mean just on this board but everywhere like on other sites if anything the playstation classic gives you usb port controllers something you dont get with comparable things i dont know about you but if i could choose between controllers with usb or with wiimote ports id know what id pick    all of that being said i personally think all those miniature consoles are dumb and unnecessary to people whove been into /vr/ for longer than a year but i just find it hypocritical that people shit on the playstation one while the rest of them have got the same problems if not even more and people barely say anything about it well except here on /vr/ of course
  classic mini consoles are useless but at least the nintendo ones are quality products while the ps is complete garbo  see it wasnt hard
  one of the few intelligent post thank you  the problem of this board is being full of nintendo babbies like this one  thinking an overpriced and underpowered arm soc hint raspberry pi is way better in every way but im sure nintoddlers think its shit is a quality product  all those miniature consoles are dumb and unnecessary  /thread
  apparently the emulation is fucking garbage too also the nonsensical inclusion of pal versions
at least the controllers work on windows 10
  not everybody speaks american
  for the curious
  thats not an excuse the pal versions are inferior mechanically read the thread before commenting next time
  look at the emulation quality you fucking mongoloid  anyone using nintendo babbies as a grownup man has probably massive mental deficiencies and shouldnt be allowed on this image board
  ok but what makes that different from say the nes and snes classic  nes/snes classic had a better selection of games better emulation and the proper controllers
  based lgr
  did anyone disassemble it any links
  
    this site has some more info apparently its running android
  well they should have made own version for germany france spain and italy that has those shitty pal versions
  if theyre both useless then what the hell does it matter how well its made i could have a ton of ashtrays made of different materials but theyre all just as useless to me regardless of how well theyre built because i dont even smoke  if all those miniature consoles are useless than it doesnt matter how or from what its made as long as its useless its useless to get it anyway      better selection of games  thats subjective and you know it  better emulation  nintendo has never been picky about emulation see the vc releases and the gba releases of several nes and snes games and even then i doubt its even remotely comparable to say nintendulator or higan  the proper controllers  im sorry but i dont see what youre getting at here you can easily play the vast majority of psx games on an original playstation controller its like saying the nes classic was incomplete because it didnt come with the zapper or that the snes one needed to have the mouse most games dont even need the sticks on the dualshock controller and the few that do are easily playable on emulators and original playstations  not counting rereleases on digital stores    so tell me how is the playstation classic worse than those other two again      oh look another youtube video where they complain about the playstation classic and what do you know its from that guy who people know as that guy who plays dos games on anything he can think of while occasionally doing duke nukem impersonations fuck off with your youtube shilling
  thats subjective and you know it  nobody fucking asked for rainbow six ps1 or the terrible localisation of persona  nintendo has never been picky about emulation  yes but theyve upped their game for the classic with a new emuator thats much better than vc    the few that do are easily playable on emulators and original playstations  thats a terrible argument
  the few that do are easily playable on emulators and original playstations  so then why would i buy a playstation classic instead of just emulating
    one of the few intelligent post thank you  get back to plebbit samefaggot you wont get upvotes for saying thank you to someone elses post here
  thanks for pointing that out
  input lag is fucking game breaking you stupid fucking millennial cunt
  it has been mentioned by multiple sources
  how is the playstation classic worse than those other two again  mixing pal versions with ntsc versions  inaccurate sound emulation  forced filter with no image customization
  butt hurt gaystation loyalist
  git gud
  call out obvious flaws on a shoddy sony product   buh buh buh nintendo  every time
  making excuses for game breaking flaws  big sony dick all the way down your throat
    only one of those was me also isnt it ironic that youre accusing me of samfagging while you seem to do that yourself ah the joy of projecting
  this is what i thought they were doing and the emulation would have actually been good
  devil dice is a net yaroze game and thats on the japanese version
  i dare you to play the palversion of tekken 3 and then the ntscversion  i dare you doubledare
this thing is a dumpster fire    digital foundry absolutely destroys it
played it today    had fun with it
  play  we all know the point of this thing is decoration emulation quality is irrelevant when youre just going to put it on a shelf and never turn it on again
  ill probably finish every game first and then put it on the shelf and maybe bring it down for some casual tekken 3 play with anyone who comes over
  they wont be your friends anymore when they have to play the pal version
  basically you spent 130 over a pp console running on an emulator how are the controllers can you easily hack the damn thing
  they included metal gear solid  most of the meta fourth wall shit doesnt work correctly  any game psycho mantis would comment on is not on the collection    its like they went out of their way to make this as bad as possible
  psycho cant make the ill move your controller stunt  yeah that is pretty bad actually
please wake me up when they hack this thing
  s o n y p o n y
  weirdly my tv says its a 60hz signal is it doing some sort of 25 frames interpolation
  apparently its running android  lol what a shit source no way is running android  linux probably but no reason to use art or dalvik on this    look at the emulation quality you fucking mongoloid  this one is more powerful and can without doubt run snes better than the snes classic also with enough storage for the entire library of snes nes genesis e probably more  youre still in time to learn how computers work hint is not magic    thanks for reminding me this place is full of faggots in denial
  which part of  those miniature consoles are useless  you didnt understand  only idiots pay for emulation you pay for the hardware and a raspberry is a better one
  weirdly my tv says its a 60hz signal is it doing some sort of 25 frames interpolation  yes and badly      throw your pissclassic in the trash    you can get a retropie up and running at a cheaper price and with more games by the time this shit is hacked
  nintendos mini classic boxes are shit too
  at least the nintendo ones are quality products    better emulation  enjoy your noisy video output antiseizure filters and sound latency    every single official mini console is trash sony nintendo or otherwise
  which part of   how is the playstation classic worse than those other two again  did you forget about
  not even an insult that works
  anyone else pissed on how sony keeps betraying the console that made them  no because i dont buy their games anymore
  the console that made them  how to spot a zoomer in one sentence it was the walkman that made sony not the gaystation
  whew lad
  console
  what the fuck
  emulation on x86  emulation on raspberrypi  emulation on playstation classic  emulation on snes mini  is so difficult to understand
  emulation on playstation classic  emulation on snes mini  but thats wrong you dolt
  can the snes emulate psx games better than the playstation  i dont think so  im pretty sure the psx mini can emulate snes as good as a snes mini having more powerful hardware
  can the snes emulate psx games better than the playstation  is the snes designed to emulate psx  the snes classic can actually emulate snes well while the playstation classic fails to emulate playstation well
  is the snes designed to emulate psx  nintendo just used the cheapest arm soc that could run snes decently there is not design  again learn how to compute  youre going to hack it anyway and run everything the hardware allows  not being a brainlet is a prerequisite though
  if i want to play retro games on my tv i would buy a pi
  even some more things why this shit sucks hard if it is not public known yet    1 couldnt power it over usb from my tv so it need way more power than nes mini etc  2 for some reason doesnt seem to proper work over a hdmiswitch so a direct connection is better  3 its known that the west version is mostly pal but persona is not mainly because it only was released in the us for english but why not ship with both versions of the other games then memory isnt that fucking expensive  4 you can choose japanese for menu etc but of course no japanese versions of the games  5 the graphics are ugly and not ps1standardstyle and the translations of the menu like start for game is in some language weird  6   7 fuck this shit    fuck you sony
  sure thats my choice too im just laughing at nintendo fans defending their quality products  i like nintendo games but the hypocrisy of using pirated roms while at the same time taking down sites hosting them is inexcusable  before you smartasses say something smug i already have all the rom sets i care about but their behaviour is still disgusting and make things more difficult for kids that want to play some classics like i did back in the day
  ok but think about it from the consumer angle not the hacker angle
  bbut nintendo
  why not ship with both versions of the other games then  apparently it does  
  how to spot a hipster  if you cant fucking read the previous poster that clearly stated that he was pointing to the first console it also wasnt the fucking walkman which sony first made/became popular with you retarded cunt
  no it just means the emulator is basically is faking 60hz  there is no space for both isos of the game
  fuck off corporate bootlicker    snes classic is the clear winner cheaper better games better emulation  i cant find a reason not to hack it or at least let a friend do it
  ok good
pure proof that sony never can into console hardware and always fucking stole ideas tech and copied from others like the ads mentally challenged kid in school
  based  now go buy for the 47th time a super mario bros 3 rom and remember that emulation is bad
  dumb much sonytard
  no u shill
  dumb much nintentard
  emulation quality is fucking shit because the thing too damn weak    seems more like the arm fork of the emulator is underdeveloped  similar issues appear even on nvidia shield devices
  sorry but youre dumb as fuck the walkman is undoubtedly what made sony a household name in 1979 its what made them both financially 385 million sold and in terms of global brand recognition fucking zoomers trying to act knowledgeable about shit that happened decades before they were even born makes my piss boil
the df retro video pretty much murdered any hopes of sony trying to do something useful
why werent the reusing the pstv stuff ffs reeeeeeeeeeeeee i mad
  with bios  what bios are they using is that known already
have neve seen these come up in threads
  bump for interest
  better or worse than spore
  i want to say that its better
any tips/tricks     will be visiting the local arcade soon and want to get the high score in the place since its a fairly unknown game for the normal crowd ive gotten i think 6000 or so once but usually i get shot as soon as i spawn or evil auto spawns and chases me down before i can get to the other side of a room
just now realizing i said auto instead of otto
i used to play the atari 2600 version and it was cool i dont think there are any tips or tricks for this just enjoy your time and the hiscore will come eventually
  remember not to die in real life right after playing
    i just picked this up for the 2600 what game mode does everyone play on seems like 3 is the best since it has evil otto
also does this game have an end or do the mazes go on forever are you placed back at the beginning of the maze when you die
  the game goes until you die
  git gud or try an arcade only frequented by 20 something wannabe zoomers who cant beat the lowest default scores
  no pleas dont do it the game kill you in real life with blodd   just enjoy your time anon i dont think there are any tricks just avoid dying obviously
its old and famous enough that many have already analyzed it to death if you go looking stuff like this    
  analyzed it to death  anon
  dont eat any fast food before playing to minimize your risk of heart attack
    i would also avoid large quantities of cocaine  you know just to be safe
  not going for the authentic 80s experience
  not snorting cocaine off a trans escorts tramp stamp while listening to elo on your walkman    wow anon you might as well be playing an emulator at home
  fairly unknown game
  not snorting cocaine off a trans escorts tramp stamp while listening to elo on your walkman  ill supply the coke if you supply the tramp stamp 
    you must be a millennial tramp stamps started in the 90s   tranny escorts yeah those you could get in the 80s werent as convincing as todays
    yes for the normal crowd they think dk pacman space invaders and any sf/mk/mahvel game
  if you say so berzerk may not be pacman but its way up there in the list of well known arcade games
  not having parents who experienced the 80s  ftfyk      not doing shit a freaky tripfag larping as as a shedude says  youre sick fuck charlie brown
bonus points if it got spammed regardless of constant negative press
  ever giving a damn about press  absolute pleb
  video game journalism used to be honorable
  i unironically love army men and none of you retards will change my mind  best games in the series in no particular order that ive played  sarges heroes 2  air attack  army men  rts
this serie had both highs and lows that is true at the end of the story though time filtered the good titles and we can see that there are indeed plenty of them the ones the anon above me quoted are in fact the most beautiful and famous ones still there are some on the grey area that are neither very good but not bad either like the underrated imho green rogue therefore i present you one of the best tracks of the serie  
    army men 3d and army men world war team assault are good too
  the original army men for pc was so fucking good i dominated online back in the gamespy days i wielded death himself and his mame was rapid fire bazooka glitch
  that was the only army men game i had and i remember fucking loving it i loved fighting force and its sequel but everybody else thought they sucked i can understand the hate for onebutton mashing in the first game
  sonic
  secret of mana
  that game is good once you get used to spotting the tan soldiers it can be hard to see them against brown terrain theyre well camouflaged you have to take it slow pick off tans from a distance and stick to cover a good tps for its time    army men air attack was good too
  how can you possibly say that its 2 player coop zelda whats not to like    air attack was awesome    ill just say it since somebody has to
    i love the first fighting force but ive never played the second
  whats so bad about it
  i liked the first one not the best beat em up out there but still decent    never played the second one and always thought it looked like ass back in the day
  thanks op ive always dispsied that shitty game series   it just seemed so banal a complete waste of space
so am i just supposed to wander around aimlessly stumbling into events and generally having no fucking clue what im doing  because i am and im loving it
  the game was produced and supervised by kawazu so yeah thats what youre supposed to do just explore and go with the flow
for those interested theres a hack out there that removes hitstun from enemies making the combat more challenging
  this 
  yep thats the one only downside is 2player doesnt work with it
thats a nice dollar ya got there would be a shame if i didnt accept it
whhhhhk  whhhhhk
  well triggered anon  also fuck you
i dont understand i owned 50 of these machines and always broke even
this is why i like arcades that have the card system    oh but while were on the subject fuck machines that only took tokens instead of quarters
  they spit out wrinkly bills      free play arcades with an entrance fee are best
  the arcades that only took cards are a scam they always make the game some odd fucking price like 105 at least make your scam less blatant i guess they were also trying to get away from easily counterfeited coins heres a tip you can order a big fucking bag of tokens from ebay and use them in your local retro nostalgia hipster barcade that uses tokens for cheap as fuck
  the card system at round 1 just uses a credit system
ive never been to an arcade with a nonworking change machine is that seriously that common
  using quarters when pennies exist  wew lad
  its referring to the fact that most change machines were finicky about the condition of the bill being inserted having even a single defined crease on the bill usually made the machine spit it back out
got to do the ol iron the bill on the top of the machine trick
  this shit made me and my buddy at work laugh our asses off
any way to cheat these things
  pull out a gun when the guy has it open
  cut out the corners of a 5 bill and paste them to the corners of 1bill
  does this actually work
  file this under shit i definitely wouldve been doing if the internet were around when i was a kid dammit
  no
  the joke went way over your head
my arcades always had surley men with pic related
  that feeling when you slid a cool fiver in there and walked away with a pocket full of quarters
  how do you feel about this
not bringing a ziploc bag full of quarters to the arcade with you
  bringing a ziploc bag full of quarters to the arcade
    this worked for me at least 95 of the time
  i never understood how these were able to turn paper dollars into metal quarters
  thats okay i never understood how the brits could stand carrying around dollars that weigh a pound each
  they are pounds though
not just going to the arcade and then emulating all the arcade games on your phone for free
  on your phone  disgusting use a pc at least ffs
  of course
  the based arcade i grew up with had a special insert a 5 bill and get 25 tokens machine i would skip lunch at school to save a fiver for the arcade
    even if it did work you just spent 6 for 5 in quarters because now you are left with a useless 5 bill
  but underage fantasies are much more interesting than reality
  seems like a good way to troll just go in feed 20s tot he machine and walk out with every quarter in the place sorry tommy you arent playing ddr today it seems unless you can dance all the way to the bank
  you say that like its a bad thing
  this
this is a good thread    thank you anon
  im sure a lot of them were just there to work but i distinctly remember a couple of those guys with superiority complexes asking for change would result in a long drawn out stare like theyre determining whether or not youre worthy to touch the quarters that support their dying business a person might support wrinkly bills better but at least you dont have to compliment their reeboks and promise your sister wants to talk to them later just to get change
  ziploc bag full of quarters  not pic related full of quarters    i suppose next youre gonna tell us you didnt do any underage drinking either
  what 16 year old was drinking crown royal more like getting some bum to buy you cheap steel reserve black labels or something did you actually do any underage drinking
  they spit out wrinkly bills  wrong source worked in an arcade for a few years protip smoothing out the bill never helped anyone litterally crumpling it works every time
in case i ever go back to time is there a way to cheat these into thinking you gave it quarters
  quarter on a string like in the cartoons
  me and my friends always thought about drilling a hole and using like threading string in it to pull out
why were those machines so big
  so that the guy who exchanges the money will fit inside duh
  ice trays molded into the shape of quarters
  are you me
  
  would that even work
  most big arcades i went to was mostly tokens 4  dollar most games 1 token to play but the ones in the mall were all quarter based honestly i felt that should be the way to go
  i heard that solid gold coins in roughly the same shape and size of a real quarter will work too
  i imagine you take one corner from 4 separate 5 dollar bills so you could still spend each 5
the real trick to scamming bill acceptors back in the day was to sandwich the bill between two piece of clear packing tape leaving a long tape handle to wrench the bill out after going through the machine     lots of textfiles on this stuff floating around from the era stringing machines with a coin on a wire/string was so widespread that some machines had string cutters in the coin mechs
  yes many flicking pennies was my personal favorite it requires a bit of practice but aside from that nothing more than a penny
underrated
  please nver post here again
  this its annoying as hell to get it right but you could spend 2 to 5 pennies per game
  thats an interesting point was the point of these machines just to free up employees to do whatever it is they do instead of exchanging bills for coins all day these things had to have cost a lot unless they were just leased out like arcade games are now
  is the purpose of machines to automate things  no the purpose of machines is to go ping
  now you are left with a useless 5 bill  the gas station wont give a shit if you pay for milk with a 5 missing its corners
  actually the us govt will take damaged money if you send it they will do their best to identify as much of it as possible and so long as you can piece together 51 or more of a bill they will replace it for you you could probably get back a normal bill
he didnt suck the arcade owner off behind the counter and get free play on all machines as a reward
   my arcades always had surley men with pic related      heres a priceless 1981 arcade attendant training video that details these surly change making bravos of the spaceport       of particular interest is the part about dealing with belligerent patron   blur of punch being thrown    only use the amount of force you feel is necessary to protect yourself patrons and the store itself
  a lot of machines came with the same factory key just get a factory key and it will work in any machine someone didnt take the time to change it out open the machine up and flip the switch to turn on free play
  love how all the electronic stuff from the 70s and early 80s always had fake wood panels and brown color all over the place fucking hell
  including arcade games themselves
  send money with corners torn off to be replaced  treasury worker notices how relatively easy it is for you to commit fraud using the missing corners  get raped by fincen secret service prior to 2001
  but those had plywood panels to begin with so finishing it with a nice laminate makes more sense than sanding down the whole machine after assembly
  i carried my pogs in one of those
hehehe  hehehheheheheh  ehehehhahahahahhahahah  ahahahaha haahah a ahhahahahahha

  if they worked so good why did you have to get 50 of them
  im totally old enough to drive  lol      just get a factory key  18 kiddo
  lock companies usually dont change locksets for big bulk orders unless they pay more for it so they tend to just ship them all with the same
  for instance data east cabinets will all use the same key from the factory

  cool video thanks for posting ive seen painted coins in circulation always wondered why someone would paint one this makes sense
  must just not be your lucky day who woulda guessed when you work up this afternoon and decided to bullshit on the internet that youd do it about locks in a thread where there just happened to be someone who worked in the lock business longer than youve been alive ive literally sold millions of cam locks that what the things used on arcade machines are called  theres no such thing as a factory key locksets that word does not mean what you think it means ka locks have the same key code and kd are different data easy cabs use different keys for the front and back and now your failure is complete
  and youd just need to open the front and reach through the hole
  based boomer telling it like it is
  just carefully rip up more of the bill so it isnt as obvious    this is all riding on the assumption that you can actually put 5s on a 1 and feed it to a machine and that it will think you gave it a 5 and not a 1 you couldnt possibly turn a single 5 into two halves of 51 or more hence you cant just magically duplicate money with the gov
  this is all riding on the assumption that an underage parroting porkie pies from before he was born is legit  and if you dont want to get caught by the cybercoinchangepolice just cut up your fingertips and rearrange the pieces
  1 dollar  3 coins  the game i want to play cost 5 coins  traumatic childhood memories fuck you op
  based and redpilled but unironically
  thatsa wat she said xddd
just finished this for the first time a stuff such exciting level designs scale atmosphere    how do the sequels stack up
  2 is pretty good imo played a little of 3 and havent played the rest
  1 is the best 2 is more of the same except with a lot of added combat which kind of breaks the pacing and atmosphere a bit 3 is still more of the same but you can start to see the level designs are a bit wacky its a bit lesser than the first two but still fun if you love tomb raider i think 1 is on the shortlist of greatest games ever made
  what about last revelation
  3 ispunishing
  its a lot more open but this works to its demerit
  some fans consider it the best and the game that shouldve been 3 instead of the one they got chronicles is just more of the same except buggier some consider it a bigger waste than 3
    wacky  punishing    how so hard stupid hard
  thats the common criticism with 3 its difficulty is higher than the other games and it doesnt help that the ps1 version is darker than the pc version also speaking of differences between the ports you get unlimited saves in pc version where as you have to collect save crystals if you want to save in the ps1
  am i the only one whos disappointed there was no boss in the area 51 level
  i just got the saturn version does /vr/ think its still a viable option to play over the psx or dos versions
playing tomb raider 1 and resident evil 1 at the same time during the holiday season 1996 was a nearly unbeatable gaming experience
  theyre just endless and theres a lot of needle in a haystack stuff needed for progression like a key is on the floor somewhere of this huge ocean maybe possibly those are typically not the type of puzzles you need to solve to progress in the first two games which require crafty problem solving and platforming you could see they were starting to run out of ideas on level design the above poster is right in saying it is a darker game overall so it becomes harder to see everything on the screen it doesnt help that one of the levels is london at night which is composed of black buildings which adds to the difficulty its not an impossibly hard game and if you love problem solving and puzzling through the world youll still get enjoyment out of it but its just a bit different hard to really explain until youve played it yourself
  sure why not i grew up with the saturn version its the same exact experience just a bit darker and the graphics are a bit worse but its not a huge difference its the same game its still great it lends itself very well to the saturn controller as well i had lots of trouble adjusting to tomb raider 2 with the ps controller
imo every game after it is progressively worse but some people will tell you 2 is the best    2 has far more combat and the level design often hinges on sudden death challenges right from the get go
  i have the saturn version its kinda glitchy towards the end of the game
  i loved 2
the first four are all great but flawed especially iii with its difficulty and save system  drop the series after that
  i like the rounded model of lara better on the saturn over the ps shane there was no handstand in the saturn though
  do people actually like tank controls
  except with a lot of added combat    2 is the one game with well balanced weapons though which i consider a strength            tlr is easily the second best in the series after the first it is bloated with stuff i honestly cant believe it was supposed to be longer and poor at giving direction but it completely succeeds at being the most epic and ambitious one of the lot as it has a scale that isnt matched by the others and has some of the best levels in the series
  just get a pc version bro
  a key is on the floor somewhere of this huge ocean maybe possibly  its funny because you just described maria doria level from tr3 where i missed that key underwater    tlr is arguably the best
  from tr2
  maria doria level    i was disappointed that these levels didnt make more use of the open ocean section
  why dont you just move to your blog gramps nobody fucking cares
  tr 4  tr2  tr3  tr1    anything past tr4 is trash especially direct sequel chronicles and the list above is not about some huge differences in quality or anything like that tr1 is a great game but its still the weakest of the four mostly due to hardware limitations and unpolished design at that stage since duh first game
i dont think tr2 held up that well it was my favorite growing up and when i replayed the first and second one i thought the first was more balanced had a better atmosphere and knew what it wanted to be trii didnt really know if it wanted to be a game about raiding tombs or an action game and it involved pretty much made you save scum all over the place due to trial and error traps      accurate representation of triii when i first played it i thought it was one big sick joke one of the biggest disappointments in video game history op just stick with 1 and 2 and laras home in 3 if you are really interested in that
  youre evil the opening for 40 fathoms was traumatic enough
first one is the best tr2 added too much combat
  me too im getting into this serie just now when i was a kid i had an original copy of tomb raider iii stolen from who knows which friend but at the time i reputed the game to be way inferior in comparison of duke nukem time to kill granted i was very young and for me just playing with a female character was a turnoff these days i recovered the ps1 trilogy and boy if its good i seriously missed something great im playing through steam because my ps1 isnt working no more but dont worry these are good versions some people even think that playing with a keyboard its a lot more precise and i have to agree the first one plays through dosbox but it isnt a great issue like i thought from the ii onwards they understood the errors and made it playable with its own engine    if you get used to them its actually pretty tight especially for a game like this
  never noticed any glitches care to elaborate do you mean clipping issues
  yes      i thought the first was more balanced had a better atmosphere and knew what it wanted to be trii didnt really know if it wanted to be a game about raiding tombs or an action game and it involved pretty much made you save scum all over the place due to trial and error traps  well said i was trying to put my finger on what felt off about 2 compared to 1 and you summed it up here so perfectly still a great game but the gameplay experience takes a hit due to what you said      that trauma was what the first two games did so well opening to 40 fathoms was excellent      agreed a lot of triii looks so cool but they dont really do anything with it
is there a way to not get electrocuted here sorry for being a faggot
tomb raider i and iii are laughably bad while ii is just unplayable havent bothered with the rest but ive never been so disappointed with a series in my life
  its possible to dodge the bolts yeah but its mostly a runandpray thing but the game is relatively generous with medpaks    zeus room  its thor hence the hammer
  i had to use a guide here you have to jump to certain tile on the right    i wouldnt call them inherently bad but the real highlight of these games is lara herself wish they were as good as she is
  lara is definitely the highlight especially when shes wearing the outfit from the london levels in iii
  the hot take board is that way 
  someone not liking your favorite game isnt a hot take anon i just thought the games were super lackluster and silly for every fun puzzle/mechanic there were like three shitty ones even when there were good ideas for levels they end up being more tedious/boring than they ought to be like the kayak level in iii
  there are only two alternatives either you loath something or its your most favourite thing ever  are you by chance american asking for research purpose
  yes
  its thor  yeah when i restarted the game and saw the writting on top of the room i instantly thought fuck i renamed the filename the wrong way hopefully anons wont notice it dang    is that so i tried something similar but it doesnt matter what i do at least one thunder strikes on me its not a problem though because the aforementioned anon rightly said that the game is generous with medkits
  it figures
  even when there were good ideas for levels they end up being more tedious/boring than they ought to be like the kayak level in iii  the man with no taste mabudu gorge is one of the most fun levels ever made in trs by core
  no i meant a couple oversights and a graphical glitch in the atlantis level theres a big puzzle room where you have to press a couple levers to move the platforms around to get to the next room the hallway with a secret and was guarded by 3 atlanteans in this version despite the switches being there the floors trigger the room change in the final level around halfway through or so the inventory background stops working and displays a blue background until you reset the game
    i meant to respond to you    
  the first one im not really sure what that is ill have to look into that and replay it and see what youre talking about the second one definitely never happened to me so i dont know
  oh fuck off you knew exactly what you were doing when you came into a thread of tr fans and said your game is shit kiddo you could have come in with an argument there are several explanations above for why people enjoy the game so much or why people think its a great game if you had come in in response to one of those with disagreement on specific points or came to point out overlooked flaws of the game that would have been a fine debate but you know exactly what you did you came in with your shitty /v/ posting and then you got called out on it    and yes the kayak level isnt well executed thats one of the many reasons all the posts above say i and ii are better than iii because they dont make those kinds of mistakes
  t 35yo neet
  which region version do you have
  i always wanted to see a complete level where lara would dive inside the ship wreck with diving equipment without a single air pocket or dry patch anywhere and thered be a time limit in the form of a finite supply of air in her oxygen tank adding a sense of urgency    but still cant complain after all we got 4 full levels of lara running around in her bare feet 3
  there was some level like that in chronicles but it wasnt very interesting
  i know they really missed an opportunity fucking eidos forcing them to push out incomplete games im glad theyre gone
should i avoid the pal sega saturn version if i have ntsc console the us version is very expensive on ebay and i dont want the jp version
    
dude there is totally a cheat code to see lara croft naked in the game  there is also a cheat code that reveal a cgi where she is in a strip club and get fucked by a lot of dudes
  im not a huge tomb raider fan didnt play any of them except demo until a couple years ago so i missed out on the whole deal in the 90s    the first i whould say is a pretty decent game quite challanging with great atmosphere and music lived up to the hype i remember from back in the day for sure    the second i kinda regret actually finishing got dull as hell with nothing interesting new stuff i only remember killing fucking pablos the entire game    the third i got so bored with i stopped after a couple levels    i may replay the first in a few years but ill never bother with anything other than the first ever again    my advice is just to stop now youll only be dissapointed
  im a big lara fan and i missed those games too  yeah in terms of gameplay they feel rather laborious i finished all the classics but now i dont have any power to play lau
  i could definitely go at least one more tomb raider game even if it sucked compared to 1 im trying out syphon filter now so im thinking of going tr game  sf game  tr game etc
    why would you play the original when theres the masterpiece called tomb raider anniversary
  people will probably say youre baiting while they would be right  but for a wrong reasoncore good crystal bad  anniversary while being good didnt replace the original because its not 11 remake and they play and feel not the same
  theres truly nothing more satisfying in syphon filter 1 than to taze people to death
uhh kinky outfit
  im living under a rock compared to most people but i dont see anything kinky about her signature outfit
  he says skanky
  its a quote from duke nukem time to kill     true
  2 has some nice levels  i loved the sunken ship  but it throws too many baddies at you  3 is a cunt it is purposefully being mean to you but overall its ok  4 is decent
  yeah i understand i said it in general you probably heard plenty of time people who refer to her outfit as something embarrassing
  is there a way to not get electrocuted here sorry for being a faggot  there is calculate yout timing jump when the lightning is still striking the ground and jump with dive twice forwards
    sin also had this gem
  i wonder what the sign language says  probably fudge you
  im finding snipershotgunning guys from miles away just by crouching with the lockon to be good fun could do without the secondodd input lag though
aww look at laras wee boat
  our second computer came with a tomb raider ii demo that was the first two levels we played the hell out of that level and loved her wee boat it was comfy as heck
what kind of underpants do you think lara wears
  my argument against anniversary is always about it not even pretending to be a faithful remake because i couldnt care less who made it my issue is entirely about them having all that technology massive team to work with and toby fucking gard as onsite consultant who actually did a stellar job and this time got paid for it and still fucking things up and streamlining levels to tubevision  and dont get me started on retarded arena boss fights especially the trex that moment was so out of breath and any sort of awe not to mention dread or simple shock im still confused how one fucks up so bad something as simple    also this  
  probably something simple and practical
  commando
  what about last revelation  in my opinion the weakest of the classic tomb raiders    order with which i played them  4 3 5 1 2    best to worst in my opinion  1  3  2  5  4    purely on gameplay though i rate 3 more than 1 but 1 has tighter story atmosphere and balance all around so its the best game    oh and dont bother with pc versions playstation tomb raider is better in every way to pc both graphically and gameplay wise    ways in which playstation is superior to px  1  save crystals give an extra challenge and rhythm in playstation playstation has better graphics eg gold lara and music pc lacks music and more   2  minimal differences between pc and playstation  3  pc version sucks too dark and buggy playstation save crystals add a lot in tactics and rhythm also better graphics in playstation pc is too dark flares dont work etc also pc is too buggy  4  something is off with the pc graphics  5  something is off with the pc graphics too buggy pc version
  get good tomb raider 3 is brilliant
  yes when you get them its very precise and purely skill based    id like some other 3rd person adventure game to have precise controls not necessarily tank controls like the classic tomb raider
  save crystals  save crystals are the best thing about tomb raider on playstation
  awful  yhe wavy playstation graphics hide the block based tomb raider world  the high resolution pc reveals them and breaks immersion
explain me why there are gorillas crocodiles and mountain lions inside a secret greek temple with no prey in sight    i feel like the combat would be better off removed completely rather than shoehorning vicious animals in places they dont belong just to give lara something to shoot at
  not in case of tr3 the game is fucked because of those
  last revelation  worse than chronicles  worse than tr2  nigga are you trying get some easy contrarian points
  3 is trash but last revelation is pretty good and also the scariest in the series
  aside what was already described about gameplay the ps version is infamous for its save system the fucking save crystals they are right in the stupid hard territory because you end up replaying huge parts of levels for no other reason than deliberate lack of saving spots the game with regular saves pc version is still hard and challenging but not stupid hard bullshit or rather  if you fuck up then you dont have to spend 20 minutes recreating your steps and trying not to die in the process
  just use savestates only zoomers care about artificial difficulty
  im not sure you understand the issue at hand
    no youre just a bitter virgin
    thats wrong they got the feeling right that they dont play the same is good since the original gameplay was just horribly outdated even back then
  game that literally defined the genre  the original gameplay was just horribly outdated even back then
  nope its just my opinion  i feel that once you get to alexandria the game becomes boring and repetitive    chronicles the first two levels rome and russian submarine are uninspired but then the next two levels are brilliant ireland was never done before and it works in a great campy way and then the high tech heist level is a stroke of genius although i will agree it stretches the limits of classic tomb raider engine    also i believe the last revelation and later engine is worse than the initial trilogy engine there is just something off to laras movement in 4 and 5 and lets never talk about angel of darkness
  uses savestates  complains about zoomers  this board is really dead
      anniversary is dope and along with legend and underworld form a brilliant trilogy    although i love anniversary the lighting and coloring in the ps3 version was fucking amazing i still think that tomb raider the classic one is better and imo its not just nostalgia although it largely is anniversary absolutely butchered atlantis the bio mechanical horror of tomb raider is completely gone thats a fucking crime    if anniversary kept the gore and disgust to prey levels of biomechanical horror it would be awesome but they butchered it
  you are not even trying
  anniversary absolutely butchered atlantis the bio mechanical horror of tomb raider is completely gone thats a fucking crime  this  the game was actually better in greece and egypt had entire bunch of improvements but also some issues on its own too but came atlantis and all bets were off
  nope you are just not good enough to understand the brilliance of save crystals
  so the game is getting boring and repetitive when it starts for real and then you talk about ny levels as if they were some sort of good thing and not bugged mess  yeah you are totally not a contrarian of course not
  last revelation is the weakest in the series and almost trash but 3 is very good brilliant if you are good and also the scariest in the series  fixed it for you
    you both are not good enough  save crystals are essential for the classic tomb raider gameplay and this is why tomb raider 2 is the weakest of the original trilogy
  i bet you think these arcade games that designed to fuck you over so youll drop another coin in the machine are brilliant too
  different anon but for git gud memery there is /v/ meanwhile psx version of the game is wellknown for the fact its dialed down on gamma so its dark as hell even in areas that shouldnt be and has massive replayability issues due to retarded save system
  git gud    original trilogy  no such thing you pretentious faggot
guys could you please stop i mean its so blatant and you keep taking the bait anyway
  different anon but for git gud memery there is /v/  nope tomb raider is an adventure save crystals help in this feeling  meanwhile psx version of the game is wellknown for the fact its dialed down on gamma so its dark as hell even in areas that shouldnt be  use flares thats why the game gives you so many flares it makes it atmospheric the lighting of tomb raider 3 is playstation is genius and a masterpiece  and has massive replayability issues due to retarded save system  levels are supposed to played with minimal saves it breaks the flow with saving all the time
  defend this anniversaryfags
            
  3 games  literally ii and iii in the title  not a trilogy  its a trilogy plus they share the same engine last revelation has a new engine
  use flares  confirmed you never ever not even once played psx version you double nigger  its like you are too fucking dense to even grasp the concept of low gamma to understand flares arent solving this shit
    i pity for not being able to realize that people have opinions that dont follow whatever the media are saying
  5 games  hows that trilogy to you  last revelation has a new engine  it didnt    and im bored with replying to your bait at this point its not even engaging anymore
  it didnt  explain then the 3d pickups  the new animations  the gapless lara  the new inventory  the new menu  the combining thing    its a new engine thats why 4 and 5 are not as good as the first 3
anniversary is garbage
  hows that trilogy to you  where in the official artwork it says 4 and 5  nowhere thats where    im not going to reply to your bait anymore
  its the same fucking engine you moron literally added two new moves to it and thats fucking it rest is fucking new ui hows that even related with engine  and 3d pickups were already present in tr3 you would know if youd actually played any of those games
daily reminder that anniversary s st francis folly is better than the original
  dont swear faggot grow up  its a new engine you should be blind not to see it  and if you remember how it was promoted tlr was promoted as a new engine with bump mapping with new high poly lara model and a brand new inventory  it was a new engine based on the old sure but new
  plus the old engine couldnt support rope physics like tlr did
  pic for you      i dont really think this is an argument as in  a thing to argue about greece is vastly improved over original even if definitely on the short side of things on the other hand the original had superior atmosphere because while the puzzles were almost insultingly simple or there was no puzzle at all that place was simply scary poseidon room in original was just a deep fucking hole but because of that you werent exactly sure if you are going to make it or if there will be some secret passage to enter for air or something still entire greece is better on the gameplay side
    not him but by this logic every single cores tr was on new engine every one of them
    op here does turning up the gamma in the emu / os solve this effectively
  what do you mean  i actually finally understood what people meant about precise controls when i replayed legend vector where you jumping depends on the current angle of the camera rather than point where lara is facing i fell a lot just like with grapple jumps from walls in tra
daily reminder that black mesa is a more faithful remake than anniversary
  pic for you
  riddle me this  why playing emulated psx version if there is superior pc version since day one    and more seriously to answer your question not really the colour palette is screwed by doing so just play pc version
  there is a clear leap small one but observable between 3 and 4  both in tech control appearance but mostly in feel  its a new engine
the resident evil remake still better than anniversary
  superior pc version  pc version of tomb raider was always shit buggy and unbalanced
  you plan to repeat that 1000 times in attempt to make it true or something  because its not its the same engine that was ever in use with patchworks of additional elements from tr2 3 and 4      how do you know if you never played any
  and im saying this despite having played them back then on pc  when i replayed them on playstation a decade later i was astounded on how much better it was on playstation  there is no contest  tomb raider is a playstation game or if you dont have one emulate it on a pc with a controller or play the psn store version
we had a nice tr thread  had
  see this   stop baiting
  tell me why tomb raider anniversary is worthy
  where is bait in pointing out the game was always accessible on pc without either issue psx version is suffering from  no seriously explain this to me pc version has no problem with gamma and you can save whenever how is then psx version superior aside opinion from someone who played it a decade ago
  because its a good game and classic tomb raider grid based system was too old to be remade    anniversary was a good remake/reimagining with the exception of atlantis it was ok but the weakest part and disrespectful to classic atlantis
  the t rex battle was garbage
  peru was shit that last literal 18 minutes
  how is then psx version superior  better lighting  better controls  save crystals 1 and 3  less bugs pc had save bugs  better balance between resolution/textures/aliasing/details  better music and sound in 1 pc sound in 1 was comically bad and lacking
  pretty much this  desu pc versions are reportedly of varying quality whereas i can just plugnplay with the psx ones not opposed to playing on pc though ill happily switch to pc for 3 if thats the better version
anniversarybabbies cant defend their shit remake
  t moron who never played the game  youve just listed two main problems of psx version as why its better you also entirely made up two of your claims and failed to realise pc version was patched 20 years ago while psx version never
  you know that shit was patched around tr4 came out right or you just like to parrot 20yo opinions
  to tell the truth im frightened of amount of shit going in this thread its like most people itt never even saw a gameplay of any given classic tr not to mention played them
  you had a nice ecochamber  dont worry you will have tomorrow    then you cam still bitch on how anniversary was not good it was good 3 is the trash it is the second best after 1 4 is the best or second best it is the weakest still good though pc is superior its shit compared to playstation versions    now you can start saying that im baiting and trolling despite i didnt hate any game just for the fact i wasnt mindlessly repeating the bs gaming journalist spout without having played or ever appreciated tomb raider    have a successful circlejerk in the next thread
  anniversary still is garbage
  man i dont know shit i just pulled up steam for tr1 saw folk complaining about dosbox different/no music shit like that so fuck it emulate psx ive already started 2 on psx but like i say if the pc versions are kickass ill happily switch    parrot 20yo opinions    you asked me m8
  lalala his opinions are not what i read online  reee you never played the games  stalememegif
  i say if the pc versions are kickass ill happily switch  avoid  either buy the psn versions or emulate the psx game on pc  native pc port is inferior compared to psx
  2018  still doesnt know to avoid steam releases  especially when retro  i mean what fucking for gog stands for or at least used to stand for      you forgot to add brand new and fresh npc meme to your post
  funny how none of those youve tried to pin to me is my opinion but at least you managed to present why this thread is fucked  its full of your attentionwhoring
  nah i couldnt do that i wouldnt want to dehumanise the npcs by associating them with you
  its full of your attentionwhoring  im sorry i had an opinion that was against the hive mind  you will have the hive mind tomorrow  like you had yesterday and the day before
  you had a nice ecochamber  you are american arent you  why are you faggots so obsessed with having conflict and confrontation in everything is it due to protestant bullshit about righteousness is is your hyperindividuality that demands to be pronounced every given chance or is it just insitutionalised stupidity
  anyone who disagree with me is just a hive mind   or maybe you are just wrong hm
  you are american arent you  quick lets place him in a little group so i can attack him by association  you are a coward and im not american  why are you faggots so obsessed with having conflict and confrontation in everything is it due to protestant bullshit about righteousness is is your hyperindividuality that demands to be pronounced every given chance or is it just insitutionalised stupidity  now you are just embarrassing yourself with this straw man  i dont know your country but your public education im sorry i meant indoctrination system really sucks
  it goes back to weber anon he started to analyse this a literal century have passed and the phenomena is even less understood now than it was back then  and how ashamed i feel now about embarassing myself on anonymouns internet tibetan tapestry oh woe me
  some opinions are wrong  you do know what opinion is right  you do know that different people like different things in games right  and they have different rankings    but somehow im the intolerable one that violated the safe space fucked up    i admit i commited the hate crime of liking save crystals and preferring psx versions i didnt know this would cause such discomfort
  im not sure if you really are dense or its part of your baiting right now either way you really are missing it
  gog versions have complaints too but im convinced ill try out the pc version for 3    i didnt think too hard about it really always thought of it as a definitive playstation series
  assertion failed backtracking  lololol i dont care
  it was a joke guys hahahahaexe  epic meme upvoted
  im not saying its not but in case of tr3 in particular when given a choice between psx version and pc version you always pick pc one  unless its the japanese release that is but im not sure pc one exists in the first place
   what
  the t rex battle was garbage  i dont like quick time events either  but you cant replicate the trex  in 1996 we didnt know a trex was coming and we were like is that a velociraptor which blocked our view  gameplay wise the trex wasnt that good honestly it was just bang bang bang  it was atmospheric and was taking advantage of the deficiencies of the psx  genius but like all masterpieces it cant be replicated    all in all anniversary did good by sidestepping direct comparisons    omg he defended anniversary  baittttttt  thread_ruinedjpg
  casual zoomer
  you pick the pc stop pretending your opinion is the be all end all many prefer the psx versions and now that classic tomb raider is completely outdated graphically the highresolution advantage that pc has isnt a strength actually a deficit because it reveals graphical glitches    also the psn version of 3 doesnt have gamma issues and if i remember correctly neither the emulation
  hehehe i placed him in a group  now i can attack him by loading zoomer_insultsdat
  in 1996 we didnt know a trex was coming and we were like is that a velociraptor  anon t rex works every single time even when you are expecting the fucker its the combination of execution placement and music that all builds to it it works without a fail on people who dont expect it and on those who already have guns ready  and it was perfectly possible to replicate because rather than using limitations on draw distance you can simply add visual effect like fog to modern game daily reminder anni is 11yo in fact from all thats known core using free running engine managed to recreate that moment without a fail    by sidestepping direct comparisons  only that it didnt it directly led to being copared on every single step and the comparison screens ingame along with commentary from gard as the reward for finishing the game only fuelled it the comparison was inevitable regardless of anything and trex is such iconic moment turning it into qte arena fight was one of the most stupid decisions imaginable  to me anniversary is a flawed project that still had a massive potential but only managed to use it here and there while in general failing completely as a game after all it was a 10th anniversary game released year too late due to corporate bullshit so this already was bad then came extensive streamlining and modern difficulty progression so the game only really shines in egypt where it strikes the right balance between being thing on its own and a good remake/reimagination/rewhatever
  different anon but nobody said here anything about higher resolution as advantage of pc version the psx version is simply dark thats it and as already explained above that just use flares isnt solving it because the game is simply locked on low settings its that simple certain places are impossible to see unless you sit in a perfectly dark room and the only source of light is screen even if chugging flare after flare india and pacific are especially annoying because of it as the textures are brownbeige making it all that harder to see while on pc version its not a problem at all in the very same locations
  well magic exists also advanced ancient civilizations with genetic engineering and shit also dinosaurs
  there is not issue if you use savestates i dont give a fuck about what the devs intended i just want to have fun    i was using emulators before you were even born faggot    you think not wanting to waste time on a 20 yo game is bait lol at your life
psx version  wanting tanky controls be even tankier  actually defending save crystals  saying lower resolution is better  that texture jitter  that gamma  bbbut muh no bugs and atmushphere  i dont have to say anything about this it speaks for itself    also  anniversary is a remake not a remaster those are different things remake does not have to be exactly the same as original and thats ok more tomb raider for me
i loved the first one played it without looking at a guide i was disappointed that the 2nd and 3rd games took place in more modern settings and had more enemies that were guys with guns they had some cool levels but i was impatient and used a guide for most of the games
  not the faggot defending psx version nor either of the guys trashing anniversary but qtes were a mistake along with boss fights with this bigass hp slider on top of the screen atlantis as simply lava and glowing rocks is boring too other than that the game is ____fun____ if a bit on a short side
  i liked that fight with two centaurs in anniversary
  this my exwife gave me triii for a christmas gift  typical ballbusting move on her part
i got them all on that eidos steam sale where each was for less than 1 however i got dosbox crap that barely runs    so yeah i guess ill just emulate has anyone here tried this specific game with all the currently available ps1 emulation enhancements perspective correction widescreen hack overclocking and whatnot  or should i just stick to real console for this one
  why isnt lara a nudist
  shes a modest and proper lady
  and why should she be
    save crystals would be the perfect system if you could save in a given crystal as many times as you like unlimited saves are stupid and part of why the first tr was such a tense game
  anniversary minus censorship and qte would be great
  censorship  what did he man by this
  to get e rating the game had to cut on gore which means lara absolutely cant get impaled on anything like she did in tr1aod but instead bounces and slides off the spikes and spears of any kind which looks retarded as she ragdolls in the weirdest way possible
pc with 3dfx option
  all the ps1 games are essentially expansion packs on the original in different settings
  nothing like nowaday
  i agree about weird ragdollthey should have made more fixed animations for it on the other hand i wouldnt like explicit gore like in the nulara reboot
  pierre brought them with him
  i didnt really noticed that  maybe because i rarely died
  zoomer
  ya know despite the name its not actually cold weather that gives you a cold or the flu
  excuse me
  literally calling humans tools designed for a single purpose  youre looking for reddit or resetera friend
just what the fuck is his problem
  its less about muh hyperrealism gore and more about simple comparison in core games you could get simply impaled on spikes glass shards or barbed wire and it wasnt exactly explicit even considering technological capabilities comes anniversary and suddenly they cant get her impaled because ratings      same on first playthrough i died grand total of twice both times due to miscalculated jumps  but i did a lot of reading about production trivia for pretty much every tr aside the ongoing trilogy hence the knowledge about the censorship and the reason for it
  ever heard about germs      i mean look at him and ask yourself that question
  of course i heard about it but cold negatively affects immune system
  still wont make you sick by itself but i guess if one is anglo then a bit of peruvian snow is all it takes even without any pathogens
  what do you think about that scary motherfucker how did you feel like when he popped out
  i always found all the mutants to be hilarious rather than scary their design along with proportions and everything else made them look like stuffed animals for halloween or something
  not necessarily depends on how well you acclimate i deliberately walk on snow barefooted these days to toughen myself up havent seen a sick day in 35 years
  not the anon you are replying to but you are fucking retarded i wasnt sick since i was 7 im 33 now you think i achieve that because i walk barefoot and temper my body or because i dont have tonsils  you remind me morons falling for the peasant mania of the early 20th century living like the good poor peasants because they are the true salt of this eart so walking barefoot on fucking purpose rather than realising average peasant was too fucking poor to afford good pair of shoes
  none since her original costume design is a leotard with shorts on top some games / art retain this others dont
all these straight fuck you traps in 2    man i cant imagine what 3s gonna be like this already feels like the work of somebody who hates tomb raider
  this already feels like the work of somebody who hates tomb raider  because it was the team working on tr1 minus gard and douglas was put on the job to shit out tr2 for next november without having any idea where to even take the series they only agreed on the principle they would be left alone to their own devices after making tr2 they then made project eden and then quit core  the hate relationship with the franchise is pretty much what defined tr under core
  you are fucking retarded    no i knew exactly what i got into and i wanted to try it because it felt exciting and then it stuck as a habit    so 26 straight years pray tell me where exactly are you situated that youve managed to avoid encountering flu strains that your immune system doesnt recognize and therefore fails to defeat to me 35 years is fucking godlike before i got into this retarded practice like you so eloquently put it i was sick at least once a year every year because of all the outoftowners who always manage to bring the latest variant of that fucker with them in their useless bodies    id say tempering your body is good pussy
  leotard  why leotard did the designers ever explain this choice      try opening the exefile of tomb raider chronicles for pc with a hex editor search for the word fuck youll find an ascii text message where one of the coders is cursing his job
  because it was cool you are forgetting the franchise didnt start to take itself serious until about tlr or aod depending on who you ask
    to make her seem athletic
  a documentry dicussing tr as a franchise is as old as my godson  im getting too old for this shit
  2 is even better  3 blows ass  last revelations was great but imo the desert environment gets old
  everything about lara was to exaggerate her femaleness  be crystal dynamics  end up with the franchise  get hellbend on making her realistic and grounded  and they had gard working for them for two years too as a fucking consultant and theyve clearly listened to him when he was present  what the fuck went wrong then
  most of people who worked on lau were booted anyway and then bunch of corporate decisions happend too remember that shitshow when theyve marketed the 2nd reboot under you will be able to protect lara from being raped add to that level of mismanagement that makes aod looking by comparison as a peak organisation of game development and you are at home
  she was still cool in lau in my opinion
  different anon and im a pharmacist last time i was sick it was chickenpox when i was in kindergarten i work day to day with sick people who most of the time are also dumb and cant even apply basic quaranteen around themselves i always wear too lightly for the weather because i always feel hot even if im actually close to hypothermia due to hereditary thermoregulation issues i also stopped wearing any sort of caps or hats when i was 12 and i always bike everywhere regardless of weather so that means riding through heavy rain and during winter too by all logic i should do nothing but be sick 3/4 of a year because i also dont sleep almost at all overwork myself and my diet is crap  guess what doesnt happen    tempering your body for and/or with low temperature literally does nothing and hes rightfully calling you retarded unless you are preparing yourself for arctic expedition you are wasting time your immune system is simply fucked thats why you are getting sick so easily and youve at best got a placebo effect going for yourself tempering is one of those truly stupid folk remedies on tier with hot milk with butter and honey tasty but does nothing but people try that shit anyway in some insane logic that its the coldness that causes flu and cold its been 150 years since germ theory is a thing finally fucking learn people
  not him but i assume the point was about the 2013 game and onward given the context of gards help
  oh i just got used to hate towards anything postcore here so misread his post still it seems to me he implied that cd decided to make her grounded right off the bat and i cant agree with that even that bio change about parents was made only to make plot revolve around it they didnt try to fix her like in nulara rebootie implying there was something wrong with lara in the first place
  barefoot anon here while im not ruling out the possibility that you might be some kind of genetic wunderkind i have a pretty good idea whats going on with you right now youre working your body so hard your immune system likewise is working overtime just to keep you going if what you described to me is true then youre probably so stressed youre running on pure adrenaline alone trust me this cannot last sooner or later youll have to stop doing that to yourself and just let yourself unwind and thats when it all will come crashing down when you stop your body will give up the fight and youll be a whole lot more vulnerable against whatever agents are trying to invade your body    for all the grief that youre giving me for not wearing shoes your disregard for your lack of sleep is actually a worse sin here try to sleep man trust me that shit will come back to haunt you or do you work for one of those uncaring shithead rightwing employers who will immediately punish you if you refuse to be a good little robot and actually pay attention to your wellbeing    sleep man saying this as a friend not as a foe also    i always wear too lightly for the weather    this is actually the same as what i do youre just exposing different parts of your body instead of feet trust me i know what it is to ride a bike in 22 fah weather ive been there as a kid when nobody would take me to school in the morning and it was actually a period when i didnt get sick as easily things changed when i stopped cycling
  how do the sequels stack up  stack  lars crotft hads bid boonbs lmao
    no my point was about them fucking things up entirely with tr13 i like underworld and gameplaywise i consider it a halfdecent direction the franchise was heading in modern times  thing is they worked on lau and they more or less succeeded maybe less than everyone would wanted but for a lot of people those games didnt even count as a reboot or new continuity even if it was they hired gard for legend and he pretty much stayed with them until late stages of underworld development giving dozens of tips and quips and generally things worked pretty well rather than just plastering his name in the production team but never asking him for anything  so ultimately they had progressively better grip on how to make those games worked with and listened to gard and   they fucked things up completely with tr13 as if they never did lau in the first place and only knew the franchise as that old game that was rippe inspirational for uncharted
    they fired 30 people initially and 25 more later so basically cd replaced entire artistic division  there were also implications that tomb raiders star protagonist lara could be receiving a thorough more femalefriendly makeover  haha you can clearly see the moment of decline    a report in the the times says that the publisher  which recently described sales of the latest tomb raider title as below expectations despite shifting 15m copies globally  could look to garner more appeal amongst female gamers  this seemed insane back then probably but at the end of the day they were lucky with this direction numales who provided big sales for the 2013 reboot are basically female gamers
i love classic lara
  daily reminder that nightmarish trilogy stuck at perpetually chasing own tail almost got cancelled because first three months tr13 didnt even sold half of the games it was expected to sale ultimately they went through the entire motion solely because the first game by 5th mont was still selling pretty well should the sales drop just a bit lower they would cancel the whole project like they did with thief 4
  hnnnnnnnnnnngh
  they really should have just left it alone the new laras suck ass at pacing itself and the first game turned to shit so fast when youre expected to mow down everyone you come across i dont know why they thought about changing the game halfway through
  they didnt if you play it as intended it turns into tunnel shooter within first 40 minutes including cutscenes and there is a fuckload of cutscenes in this one and stays as such for the reminder of 8 hours the game is designed for  doesnt mean its good in any particular way but its very straighforward about being chesthigh cover shooter in linear corridors that game in some way was an amalgamation of literally everything wrong with video games between 2009 and 2013 chasing fads that go out before the game is released archery because some forgotten teen movie despite you know being rrated game copypasting other games to the point of plagiarism mod lara into looking like drake and you have uncharted pretense of being survival game pointless crafting pointless rpg elements extremely bland characters that are pinball balls just smashing over things without any agenda or purpose eagle vision   and then that shit got sequel  two of them  and still keeping all the trends despite them being already stale pile of shit by the time tr13 was released and copying the plot structure too because nobody will notice right or giving any focus to plot in the first place in a fucking tomb raider out of all things    tldr rebooted tr feels like an attempt to make the most formulaic and godawful game imaginable for the sake of showcasing to the entire industry how to not make games then they throw quarter million marketing on it to still sell it but because of such absurd costs of the marketing the game is still a financial disaster despite selling few million copies
  and the worst part is that they burned me out so hard i was unable to even start the latest one despite going through everything trrelated due to longlasting fan obligation congratulations theyve grinded the franchise to the ground so hard not even being a hardcore fan can make me play the latest game and it was still pretty much a duty to force myself through rise  never again  didnt felt this bad about and for the franchise since 04 where it was apparently on its last leg
  its bizarre but i discovered her only in my twenties ive seen the movies they were okay but thought games were exclusive for ps so didnt play them  only with 13 reboot and those threads  i made more thorough research on this matter
  friend of mine caught a lot of shit from thencurrent fandom because his entry point to the series was anniversary added for free to his graphic card he knew there are such games but simply never played them before and after playing anniversary for few minutes he simply phoned me and asked if i still have my collection of trs and if i could lend them  and even he consideres the reboot under squareenix to be shittier despite having zero nostalgia toward core era and being more used to modern incarnation of trs
  like both anons already pointed out pretty much everyone that had anything to do with lau got fired quit or was forced to leave and not even as some sort of evil conspiracy  crystal dynamics was initially for the chopping as a company when squenix took over  so when they were finally done there was only a handful of people still left that had any prior experience with making tr and even less will to bother with making it true but also unique like the enthusiasts who basically made legend for shit and giggles instead theyve just hired a metric fuckload of randos and told them uncharted is selling well make our own      you know when that image started to float around it was funny because everyone was cocksure the entire reboot is going to end up on single failed game and squenix did their best to convice everyone they will can the brand for a decade or maybe forever  and then they made rise and shadow using all that shit they already had and making it even more shit and people actually bought that crap  how i mean are people really this fucking dense to buy the same crap three times just because enough money was thrown into the advertisement
  3  pc version sucks too dark and buggy  im sure its a typo you mustve meant psx
  classic lara is perfection
  loved 13 4 is good bud repetitive 5 is a filler 6 is an unfinished mess 79 loved some aspects but hated others fucking qtes whatever followed 9 is not tomb raider and i wouldnt bother checking them even as unrelated products 2013 one being the least mongoloid  lara is great 19 more or less whatever followed is not lara croft and maybe the worst main character in years
  they never bothered me
  whatever followed is not lara croft and maybe the worst main character in years  squareenix made this somewhat competitive  i give you pic related with their shitty reboots and murder of iconic characters compared to that thing nulara at least kept something resembling the original if you squint and get drunk    also happy anniversary  twenty years ago i played my first tr the brandnew tr3 straight from the premiere
  nulara was made as objection to the original theres no worse example than that
  so was notgarrett  hes officially a completely different guy centuries later but named the same and in a game pretending to be thief  are we doing a dickmeasuring competition right now who fucked up more and harder in terms of pointless reboot
  its always funny for me how they did that already in lau especially in legend without turning the game into complete shit and the character into a whining idiot but oh well i guess numales need nulara
  as moneygrabbers they are genius
best lara
  also happy anniversary  twenty years ago i played my first tr the brandnew tr3 straight from the premiere  aah me too
    she also did the best snake plissken with tits that ever was
  how i mean are people really this fucking dense to buy the same crap three times just because enough money was thrown into the advertisement  modern movies comicbooks videogames cartoons what doesnt work like that these days
  i guess adblock is really doing wonders for me for past few years because i mostly learn about all sort of crap from interns at work those days
god i wish lara would sit on my face
  compared to that thing nulara at least kept something resembling the original if you squint and get drunk  stupid bow resemblig not a gun but two  thats not drunk thats passed out  alcohol can turn a 5/10 nulaura croft into 10/10 lara croft though alcohol and distance  fucking mongoloid character
  if you turn out sound so you dont have to hear that moaning bitch with awful accent it instantly improves  and alcohol copious amounts of it too so you can have any sort of feeling of being challenged by the difficulty rather than insulted
  daily reminder the best voice was by a frumpy english mom
  so you can have any sort of feeling of being challenged by the difficulty rather than insulted  as someone who never completed a classic tr i was very surprised to see the credits roll on one of the new games after only two afternoons of playing pretty stoned too if the old games were somewhat hard they dumbed down them too much now
  if you turn out sound so you dont have to hear that moaning bitch with awful accent it instantly improves  oh my god this
  core games required from you perfect execution of your moves while the tank controls were helpful in doing them because once you get hang of them you knew exactly what distance you are going to travel and at what angle  lau games automated a lot of things but at least still kept stuff like acceleration and some semblance of precission movement  starting with tr13 you can literally change direction mid air and they are selling those under muh realism i guess nothing does realism better than going rambo on undead samurai while cautering your kidney wounds with arrowheads heated with lighter and doing midair double jump with zero acceleration
    got the one where it is impossible to fall off a log it was in the 2013 one right in the opening entire game came crashing for me when i realised i literally cant fall off
  nulara was a mistake
bump
thanks to this thread i bought the first five tomb raider games from gog sales i saw my friends play these games on ps1 in the 1990s but i never owned the console and have never really played them myself reading the shitposting here gets me pumped as hell i hope the games are as entertaining
  youre complaining about this stuff as if the first games werent stupid easy besides the last revelation
  2 and 3 were increasingly harder than their predecessors in fact 3 was criticized for its sadistic difficulty
  look up guides on getting better draw distance music in the pc version of 1 and better controller compatibility
  anon you literally cant fall off a log to a chasm not in a sense its hard to fall off you cant you are glued to it there is literally no fucking way of falling into the abbys below  it cant be even compared with anything being done prior in the franchise
      set it up for 1445 you cant fall off that thing why even bother putting up that log if you dont have to balance and if you jump over it you cant change your position but always land on the log so whats the fucking point they just could put a straight path instead pretending there is any sort of danger    the fact its commented by an overlyexcited numale is pretty scary thou
  im not sure you even understand what the other anon was talking about but they already covered you with video of specific moment in the newish game at least in the old games if you run to the edge rather than slowly walk you were simply falling down requiring minimal level of finess and precision
  i thought videogames were supposed to be for grownups now
  grownups dont have time to replay segments
  tr2 is good  tr3 is hard as hell play on pc with infinite saves  tr4 is alright but gets confusing at times and can be as hard as tr3 in places  tr5 is more of the same  angel of darkness is shit  legend anniversary and underworld have horrible gameplay more focus on circus acrobatics  tr 2013 is a decent games but gets dull  rise of the tomb raider is boring as fuck but pretty to look at  havent played shadow of the tomb raider yet
  legend anniversary and underworld have horrible gameplay  tr 2013 is a decent games
  it might be piss easy but its still better than the lau shit
  i just dont touch the ps2 ones and later the cd ones become rail games where its impossible to not find your way and lose all sense of exploration while the squeenix ones become soap operas trying too hard to copy the uncharted games so some version of them can be available on xbox    the original core ones had imagination and were fun     but ths is just another example of how graphics get better the quality of the content declines
  dual pistols and shorts classic lara was so good the new one is too serious and screams too much
  grownups should also have the sense to realize that this shit is all of the downsides of a movie with none of the upsides
laras animations are so nice i just noticed her arms dont turn with her when you do flips with the guns out they always point upwards in the world probably done procedurally for the aiming its not something you really notice kinda funny though
  tr1 was in development for two years half of that time was spend on making animations for lara she would even use much better model but it would fucking murder psx
  toby gard right its a great job theyre so precise and elegant it really sells lara as a character
i often see opinion that lara doesnt really have a personality do you agree with it
  yup part of the reason why we even have moves like swan dive or standing on hands is because he was toying around with animation and movements and then handled it to the rest of the team to discover them  crawling was going to be part of the game from the getgo but infortunately it was cut due to percieved limitations of the engine and only was put in by 3rd game when there was completely new team working on it basically following old logic of nobody told them it wont and cant work so they make it work      opinions by who numales gayming journalists
  anonymous posters on /v/
  he created a billiondollar franchise that has spanned four gens of systems so he must have done something right
  he created a billiondollar franchise that has spanned four gens of systems  not that he has anything to show for it
i liked the first one a lot but i really fucking hate the second one so far   dude lets make 50 of the game about shooting people  fuck you
  same here except i started playing with underworld i went to buy a used game to pass the time saw the cover and thought it was literally indy with boobs focus on the boobs then i played legend then anniversary at that point i was like well shit these games are pretty decent imagine how much better the original series would be tried those then and was absolutely floored by how good they were
    nah reboots are pretty good but they are completely different and shouldve gotten a different title to show that theyre spinoffs
  /v/ also considers current state of tomb raider series to be perfectly fine and the games finally being good so go figure      if you knew what kind of shit they went through as a dev team you would be glad and grateful tr2 is still pretty solid despite the issues at hand
  that wouldnt generate so much money not that it did at least for lau but still the only fucking reason current raiders are being made is the brand recognition even if they are blatant uncharted ripoff which is really sad considering uncharted was literally tomb raider but for americans so lots of shooting and zero exploring  aside of that the joke in polish fandom is tr13 could and should be titled przygody zosi na tajemniczej wyspie adventures of sophie on mysterious island and it would be actually good game if it cut all the ties or pretense of having ones with tomb raider franchise
  so lots of shooting and zero exploring  you clearly didnt play the last two games then shadow in particular is 70 exploring and tombs and 30 shooting its especially weird because the game gives you a lot of upgrades for weapons/killing stuff but theres barely any of it a lot of fags who started with 2013 and loved the action focus are shitting on shadow for being too boring
  rise was so bad i lost any interest or even fan obligation to check shadow but if you are implying that a rail shooter like rise had any sort of exploration you are part of the problem why video games are nowdays shitty cinematic experience and not you know games  so considering tr13 was shit rise was even fucking worse literally tr13 but in siberia i feel no need to check on shadow seen first two hours of gameplay thanks this is tr13 but in peru literally couldnt care less considering how fucking serious this shit takes itself and how linear it is the fact it doesnt have as much shooting which i doubt considering the game opens with fucking shootout with baddies that comes out of fucking nowhere because muh taste of powah doesnt solve shit its still linear game with close to zero bearing with the title or the franchise as such
  but if you are implying that a rail shooter like rise had any sort of exploration  literally all i remember about it is how much time it took to complete all the tombs and do everything in the game maybe because the story is absolute trash and forgettable but still     from your tone its pretty obvious that youre the old old good new bad type of person
  ive entered this franchise with legend want to imply some shit while fucking defending this fucking trash reboot  what fucking exploration you even mean when describing rise a literal sideactivity that has zero bearing with the game and is openly tucked in to say here we have tombs now rejoice we even called them tombs now  go fucking play any tr between 1 and underworld and tell me with straight face rise has exploration in it rather than murdering 500 mercenaries with explosive cluster arrows and fighting undead byzantines muh realism right
  actually and unironically trying to defend rise  nigga are you all right
i am listening to a complilation folder of various tracks from the ps1 tr games right now theyre such comfy cozy soundtracks        thats what happens when you let the greedy publisher bully you into handing over all ownership rights to your work in exchange for releasing it for you    youd think he would have learned from the music business which does this but nope and fastforward 2 decades and fools still sign over all ownership of their work in exchange for having it released       that youre the old old good new bad type of person  i am not him but in the case of the tr franchise thats somehow true better graphics dont compensate for every other aspect going to shit it reallly has lost what made it so good with the sense of exploration figuring shit out and adventure the modern ones are all about the action even qte bullshit and are nothing more than uncharted clones meant for xbox fanboys who cant play uncharted
  go fucking play any tr between 1 and underworld and tell me with straight face rise has exploration in it rather than murdering 500 mercenaries with explosive cluster arrows and fighting undead byzantines muh realism right  i did play every single game and yes rise has exploration   being a bitter  jaded faggot who cant accept that games and series change over time wont do you any good famalam     dont compensate for every other aspect going to shit  but thats not the case here is it
am i only one who have nothing against the combat in tr lara carries her pistols for a reason  also no wonder people were upset about removed combat in latest nulara game  theres not much left in the game without shooting
  like  already pointed out with tr this really is a nobrainer and the older games are better this series at this point has three itterations four if you want to further divide core run which is what makes it good 1st crystal run which is a very mixed bad and 2nd crystal run with entirely new dev team since massive layoffs prior to so its not even the company is the same with complete new people behind it which is just pathetic uncharted ripoff with hunger games tucked in which makes it very dated      not him but its very much the case the game improved in one aspect  chesthighcover shooting everything else went to shit including the fact you can now make mario jumps and everything that isnt murdering things is automated
  mixed bag
  theres not much left in the game without shooting    they removed the best part of tr games for the sake of pushing more action its a loss and they dont even see it    and it wont matter ebcause theyre stuck on keeping costs low by doing like the core games did with recycling the same gaming engine
  there is more bizzare part of complain about newest adventurest of nulara  there still is a metric fuckload of combat in that game and people somehow consider it not enough i mean sure its not as much as in previous two but its also still waaaaay more than core or lau games
  well i have to admit i didnt play it but people claimed theres not much combat to use all these rpg combat abilities and other abilities are related to batman vision which is not even used in the realistic difficulty or whatever its called so game ends up as a lackluster
       this is bait right
  nulara gaym  anyone surprised it is lackluster  this is something that really gets me by surprise third time in a row nuraider is everything wrong with modern video games industry crammed into single title and somehow people are each time amazed those games are shit its like being surprised getting into water will make you wet
barefoot lara    awww yeah gurl get tetanus for daddy
  fetishists aside the barefoot levels always made me unease precisely due to the fact most of the time they happend in allrust environment
  old good new bad   tomb raider as a series is a textbook example of it first four games are the golden standard anything after that are just things falling apart more and more until all thats left is just title and name of the main character but not the character herself to connect with the series
  new tomb raider is not a bad game but has any of the elements making the original unique and appealing  now is just a generic ubishit action game
  new tomb raider is not a bad game but has any of the elements making the original unique and appealing  you mean it as tomb raider game from 2013 or the trilogy of most recent games  because i can somewhat agree with the first and laugh at you for the second
  tomb raider ii    has this masterpiece of a song right here 
  tank controls make a game play so different that i dont know how anyone cant recognize this it makes developers have to make levels designed around the idea of tank controls in short if there were more modern games design with tank controls in mind you would be seeing some pretty creative level design in a lot of games
    i am sick of that argument the original game engine was made to use the dpad since the analog stick for the ps1 controller didnt exist yet if you use the dpad instead of the stick then the controls are just fine
the original tomb raider games were basically 3d versions of the stiff euro platformers like flashback think about it in that context and it all makes sense
  let me make shit up  think about it  consider necking yourself
heres the deal about the tr reboot and shitshow that it became with leftist sjw happy yasss queen slay that it became the games and this is from what i heard    square and crystal dynamics wanted a game to go against uncharted and ofc amy henning the higher ups still harbored hatred against her for leaving the company during the early development of lok dark prophecy mix that with the sjw kool aid that cd was drinking it alot with the new wave of employees and stupid decisions and we got that monstrosity that is the tr reboot    they didnt made a tr game they made a huge and playable letter to spite henning and her work in uncharted tr2013 wasnt even supposed to be a reboot it became because they wanted a game to go against uncharted and they lost it 3 times
  not sure i played the one when lara wake up from a shipwreck in the beginning of the game my roommate got it for free with xbox live  it was mediocre but enjoyable are the others better
the original tomb raider games were based on the 2d prince of persia games get your facts right
  i dont think that someone would make aaa game just to spite certain person they just copied all the modern trends in order to sell as much as possible and losing identity wasnt a problem for them
  its another episode of gaymer gate leaking on /vr/  dont you have /v/ to post on
  it didnt help that there were tons of xbox fanboys crying constantly about wanting to play uncharted but couldnt the squeenix tr games really are made for them     and squeenix has taken so much money from microsoft that they really dont give a fuck about sony any more which is why theyve broken agreements for every major exclusive since the 360 and ps3 came out while shoveling sony reissued games as placeholders for broken exclusives
im pretty new to the series i had tr3 as a kid but i could never get very far  then around 2010 i found a used copy of the original on psx and played through it and only now am i making my way through 2  im glad i still have the patience for these games i configured my controller to get more comfortable with the game but honestly playing it with a keyboard feels just fine given how platforming works  good game
  this guy is a drooler
  honestly you should go back to tr3 asap its probably the best balance of everything as long as you are not playing it on psx ofc its fun its explorative its actionpacked its not absurdly hard for the sake of it unless we are talking psx version and despite being pulp as fuck it makes tonnes more sense than tr2 its virtually the main reason why we had the movies with jolie  tr3 delivered actual cinematic experience and didnt even brag about it or consider it something that should turn the game into overly long cutscene
1 is the best though 2 had the venice levels which had some of the most precious and unique atmospheres in the history of videogames 3 is fucking punishing and stupid sometimes but is mandatory for tr fans to check it out 4 is fucking uninspired boring and long also improvement in graphics takes away the charm of the first 3 games 5 is a cash in meh lost levels copilation special mention for angel of darkness its an awful game but has interesting ideas and atmosphere is also kind of unique and cool
  4 is fucking uninspired  boring  too long  improvement in graphics takes away the charm of the first 3 games  explain to us all how being long is bad
  you should try playing the original pc versions no game controller support no mouse support and 100 keyboardonly it was a pain in the ass even though many swore the keyboard controls were excellent      last revalation was great it had a lot of great levels like the lost library kv5 and cleopatras palace    and chronicles had its moments too i liked the irish gallows level with young lara and liked the shiny catsuit
  in a tr game long is bad when theres no variation in locations also i do think that 4 and 5 lacked charm because they werent so blocky and in the end i dont feel like im exploring menacing and dangerous places the genuin element of horror that 12 and 3 have is missing in 4 and 5 but thats just me
  explain to us all how being long is bad  not him but i do think that many games overstay their welcome idk about tr4 since i only played the first 2 games
  by the time you finish the underwater levels in 2 you feel the need to breath some fresh air cause they are unbelievably sufocating
  t someone who never played any core tr  dont even try to weasle out its blatantly obvious you are just trying to fit in at this point      if played blind tr4 has the exact balance of lenght that lasts you for 1014 days of having fun with it when played knowingly its very enjoyable 12 hours of solid gameplay so a perfect weekend binge
  i dont like your tr4 and at the time core workers wanted to kill lara when they were making it so they also didnt like your tr4
  they didnt like the game but it doesnt make they didnt make a good game tr4 is pretty much their magnum opus and deliberately so it was supposed to be the end of the series so they made it grand finale  your pointless bitching and projecting doesnt change that especially since we already established you didnt play any core game in the first place
  we  keep talking with the voices in your head
  i only played tr1 on psx but it seemed like a good version of the game  now i have the gog collection and thats how im playing the rest of the series ill get to 3 soon enough if anything it will hit me with some good nostalgia    you should try playing the original pc versions  i am now i actually like the keyboard controls only rebound a few actions  i alternate a little though sometimes i play it with an xbox controller even though the dpad is a little so so
  fine on condition you stop posting about games you never played      its specific issue with tr3 and psx nicely put by   the save crystals in tr3 were just fucking horrible and turning fun game into dark souls type of bullshit of memorise everything and expect countless reloads of looooong stretches of the game if you fuck up and you will fuck up but on pc the game is perfectly fine without ever stopping being challenging its just not punishing
  you know playing tr15 is like having that great sport car that has quirky engine that only starts up if you know the trick needed to do it if you do its a great experience but if you cant then you cant exactly use it  and same goes with classic control scheme its not perfect in sense of plug and play and it was like that always even when the games were new it took a while to adjust to the controls  but once you did the game was superb
  the flipjump that turns lara around in the air is so overpowered when you get it down
  and it makes combat so much fun with all the enemies especially those using ranged weapons having hard time keeping track of where you are while you riddle their back with bullets out of the sudden
some of these areas are awesome great use of limited tools
  and time anon never forget about the amount of crunch time they were given for each of those this makes by default tr24 wonderous games since theyve managed to produce them and they were still high quality
should i use a guide for the 2nd/3rd game i heard they get ridiculously difficult at times
  if youre stuck or looking for secrets why not
  exploring and trial and error are part of the fun of an adventure game so dont use one unless youre hopelessly stuck
  unless you completely and utterly cant figure something out play blind tr2 is definitely possible to just bruteforce tr3 is bit more tricky with certain sections of the game but still doable 14 yo me managed to finish both blind and i wasnt the smartest kid
  yes use a guide the whole time or dont what the fuck kind of a question is this hey guys should i wash my car tomorrow
  its the classic /v/ question anon a pointless stupid question that shouldnt even be an issue in the first place but is still asked out of sheer stupidity
  kill yourself
  /v/ being mad for being called /v/
  in all fairness there are some difficult parts that are hard to figure out without a guide
  which is why everyone told him that he can consult walkthrough if hes hopelessly stuck then and only then since otherwise its pointless and undermines the whole point of the game
  when it comes to peak of performance i think nothing really beats tr3 theyve squished everything they could from the engine without actually making big sweeping changes to it sure new lighting and everything being a 3d object but that was it tr4 and 5 were the ones where engine really was changed
  takes one to know one   go back there with him fag
emulating tr1 a while back  all going fine  suddenly a fucking trex outta nowhere  raptors  fucking raptors  what the fuck
  still mad
  tr4 and 5 did add new movements for lara but overall youre right    but the biggest issue is the save crystals for the average player you pretty much need to use the cheat codes to get more
  have you tried playing the pc version like every normal person did  you know no issues with saves shit resolution low and locked gamma and so on and forth
  like every normal person did  pretty sure most people played it on psx back then
  back then  and here we are today with ability to play few different versions on pc
  cant argue with that im just saying that tr is falsely associated with sony mostly especially by these normal people that were referred by you  
  tr2 no tr3 i cant even get past the first level
whats your favorite levels  sanctuary of the scion  temple of xian  atlantis  the great pyramid
seeing what you guys mean about 2 lots of cool stuff but the balace is all over the place pretty clearly designed for savescumming      atlantis and the pyramid were cool and spooky
fucking hell lads i just want to raid tombs
  the lost library  maria doria  kv5  thames wharf
  from a technical viewpoint its kinda interesting how things were done with tomb raider on the saturn or pretty much all saturn games that used distored sprites to draw 3d    but on the other side i never was a fan of the tomb raider series in the first place i played the tr1 demo on some ps1 demo disc back in the day but got discourage by the horrible controls and the sub par blocky graphics even for ps1standards
  2d sprites were used for all systems for things like medpacks in the first two its not limited to just the saturn
  barkhang monastery and madubu gorge
  thames wharf  favourite   seriously and i dont mean it as dismissive rather confused and curious
    real lighting didnt show up until tr3 either its kind of amazing how tr3 was really a lot of improvement all over the board but since it wasnt exactly a new engine most people just started booing how its the same shit as ever for fucks sake just compare tr1 with 3 and tell me with straight face its the same  and then tr4 was even bigger jump with even more cries how its the same while theyve made a new engine this time even
  tibetan foothills  all of south pacific  lost city of tinnos  karnak levels  the lost library
  i like that video it does a good job of explaining how i feel about traversal in video games i wish more games especially platforming or explorationbased games gave you control over traversal mechanics like that exploration is fun when a game has actual traversal mechanics but its boring and stupid when you just push around an analog stick until your character walks around the map themselves i miss games giving players control over most of a characters actions and also providing advanced/optional movement techniques
  thames warfs background sounds are comfy level is a bitch though except the secret shortcut but all tr3s levels are
  but all tr3s levels are  india and pacific are fine its just the classic case of urban raider being shit
  antarctica managed to nicely balance out both vibes city of tinnos is by far one of the most memorable levels in the game while the rest are no slouches either
kinda weird how they just squish textures into nonsquare spaces guess its how the engine works
this areas like something thecatamites would do damn
  i remember i couldnt properly use these ladders for some reason and just dropped down when i tried to step from it
  the best part of the trex is that when you played it at the time you had no idea whether or not it could be killed and you likely werent that proficient with the controls that early meaning you spent that entire section ducking and diving and trying to get around him i remember that runningjump you have to do over the bridge and as you hang there hes wandering around inches from your toes
  my experience on first contatct was somewhat similar i instantly went for the shotgun but since i didnt have enough shells to kill it i assumed it just cant be killed and started to frantically run around trying to avoid it
calling her laura croft
  they actually do that in the 2nd reboot including the chick mangling voice acting for nulara
    only europoors call her lara
  why is it that only 90s games can create this isolated feeling like youre all by yourself at some quiet edge of the world
  maybe its that minimalism or lack of engine capability that creates this feeling of minimalism i really have that feeling of being isolated in majoras mask and even simple games like glover
the nulara games are bad but the first is ok  2013 had a good plot going on and ok characters but gameplay was a barebones uncharted with upgrading elements rise had the opportunity to fix that problem and make a decent series only to end up as a quick crash grab in every aspect same with the most recent one
  keyboard only is great especially if you have a numpad to go with it the game doesnt really benefit from analog controls and for precise jumps in my opinion since youre given the advanced controls and time to make jumps i really like the time you have to move around and also explore the areas it gives the game more substance for exploration imo
  fat fio from metal slug series nice
  rise had the opportunity to fix that problem and make a decent series only to end up as a quick crash grab in every aspect same with the most recent one  eidos montreal lost the ability to make good games a few years back everything they do is garbage soulless cash grab nonsense now
  more femalefriendly  more feminist friendly more like  my sister loved old lara because she was a badass adventurer she played all tomb raiders only onther game she ever played were diablo 1 and 2 she didnt like new lara because she went from badass adventurer to i cant do this anymore sob whiny
  honestly tomb raider was the beginning of the downward spiral into sjw diversity quotas that has slowly but surely cucked the gaming industry beyond recognition it led the way to more blacks and females being put into games to the extent that its rare nowadays to even see a white male npc let alone main character
  this a thousand times this only closeted fags liked to play as women
  it was there for a reason  the reason was stupid  but people are also stupid  and they do stupid shit  like believing that making a badass lara a weak whiny bitch that still mowes down hordes of enemies is somehoe an improvement because it might appeal to womin better it didnt
  that gen lara is the qtest
  sound design remember when this was still a thing short draw distance so you dont exactly know whats up and unless the game was a straightout shooter barely any humans and humanoids in it so ultimately the games manage to keep the feeling of isolation and in the same time making your character isolated  then draw distance increased and sound design became a forgotten art
  more feminist friendly more like   feminist circles absolutely loath nulara anon and for very simple reason  rather than having an empowered female character that is on her own right strong independent woman without going into cheese and being selfaware of own cheese when it does theyve got depowered bland chick with zero personality that goes through all sort of abuse never learns her lessons and is simply pathetic in every possible regard along with classic american school of writing daddy issues thrown in to replace any sort of semblance to personality the last one is ironic the american part because its written by pratchett but at least we know shes projecting her own daddy issues into literally everything she ever wrote
      totally not a samefag i swear
  feminist circles absolutely loath nulara  maybe some old school feminists from 70s nufemales love nulara look at tombraiderforums state nowadays
  damn thats some shitty art
  all six staffers at the time were men    whoops    
   implying theres any coherency to feminism other than finding another angle to be outraged about something that your peers might have missed
  um no  besides are you at least partially aware all sort of third wave feminist movements arent monolith which is probably the main defining thing about 3rd wave  its every group working for their own goals rather than white upper middle class asking for voting rights 1st wave and fairier access to job market 2nd wave  and whoever did that comics was a fucking retard even if we ignore pushing muh politics into it too fucking busy sprouting bullshit to make 5 second check on tr history  alternatively heather gibson current stevens is a closeted male not to mention being the best level designer the series ever had
  im not sure you understand how modernish feminism works protip there are all sort and kinds of branches in it so rather than the entire thing being what you imagine as standard generic feminist which i bet is the image of manhating neonhaired fat blob getting triggered by everything they are just an extremely vocal group within entire ocean of different movements  its like saying that everyone who doesnt work as coal miner is by default lazy slacker or every nonfundie being automatically an atheist
  like everyone already pointed out nice you managed to take vocal minority as the main base old fandom hates nulara lau fandom hates nulara grand majority of feminist movements hates nulara or consider her worse than the old one  the only people that are left is the hipster crowd its different than it was hence it has to be good numales marketing worth 150 mil doing wonders literal kids which shouldnt be playing that game in the first place rating and radical misandrists since its wishfulfillment about gunning down large amount of males by female protag  everyone else either pretends the games dont exist or throw shit at it for being just flatout insulting to players intelligence and derailing one of the most established characters in the industry for no real reason other than misaimed marketing
  what exactly is sound design
  maybe its not a small minority after all nobody would make an aaa game with a whopping 100m budget for such a group and it seems even the latest game with relatively low review scores is going to make profit
i played underworld only it was ok i mean it was entertaining but nothing special im sure 13 are amazing though
  how can you be so sure if you havent played them
        as i said in  and   they tried to appeal to feminists by makin lara more vulnerable they went too fat with that  i didnt say they succeeded in that
whoopsie doopsie guys my hand accidentally slipped and made her tits in her ingame model giant sized  my hand also accidentally changed her titties size in every cgi movie which cost us millions of dollars to make and also this affected every promotional prerender flyers we sent to magazines and retailers  all accidentally of course  im saying that i just dont buy it even for a second
  he thinks this game was made to appease radical feminists  nigga are you retarded or just fucking delusional  its like you didnt even notice what squenix did with entire fucking library they got from buying eidos and deluded yourself its about sjw or whatever other bullshit  why people are this fucking stupid
  2018  this bullshit still alive   you know this is just an urban legend right gard was very fucking open from the very start even before the game premiered shes supposed to have giant knockers
  its like you didnt even notice what squenix did with entire fucking library they got from buying eidos  yeah they tried to ruin every single one of them care to enlighten me why
  for the same reason why disney is relaunching its entire library of animated movies  you are new to corporateowned copyrights or something
  or 80s games   you should play the sentinel all 8bit and 16bit home computers and pc as well or sentinel returns ps1 and pc
  for fucks sake if youre trolling you got me  it didnt say they accidentally shipped it that way it says one of the guys accidentally went too far on the slider when making her then they all decided it was better that way and left it
  pretty sure modellers dont operate with sliders especially twenty years ago when they were highly limited by hardware
  no one is stopping bitches from making their own games    but thats how shit works with wanting everyone elses shit to revolve around them instead of leaving it alone and coming up with their own stuff    and fuck making characters people can identify with its escapism not any form of the real world i cant identify with being a bigtittied girl since i am not female but that doesnt mean i didnt enjoy the games just the same     its not important at all and is just the excuse selfish leftists use to justify hijacking other peoples shit to make revolve around them
  they dont operate with sliders but they could have accidentally messed up the geometry or proportions for that part of the model by typing a number wrong or something
    i thought tombraiderforums hated the nutomb raider games
    as the other anon explained theyve messed up proportions and then decided to keep the result anyway her tits were supposed to be 1/10 of their final size when making a model theyve messed up created the triangles of death instead and realised hey with our limited engine this actually looks like tits  then theyve tried the planned size and it turned out they were barely visible so theyve sticked  and another anon is also right when sayign toby gard designed lara to be bigbreasted thing is he designed her on piece of scrap paper but then they had to figure out how the geometry of model should work so gard wanted big tits but underestimated the requirements under their engine and hence why the original number was 1/10 of what it eventually became    tldr  lara was supposed to have big tits since inception theyve messed up geometry for the model the error turned to be their desired effect anyway
  depends on which group of users you mean actual grogs and lau kiddies pretty much pretend nulara doesnt exist at all then there are all sorts of newfags who throw shit at each other either viciously defending or shitting on the game everyone else watches from afar and munches popcorn  also afaik shadow pretty much got ignored even by newfags on the forum
  lara with dfc  all of my yes
  i wonder who is behind this post
1/2
2/2
  how really love your pc engine dont you mine just be arriving tomorrow looks just like yours burned rondo to a disk hopefully it will work
  oof my poor english
  
  space mission  fucking nice
    
  composite video  tv just sitting on the ground  no turbo pad  0/10 step it up      this one is good
i moved everything in the living room to free up some space in the bedroom since i took this pic
  the other corner
  cringe
  im still trying to figure out how to rearrange everything so it looks nice  it does for now and its not that bad
  just lost my battle station in the paradise camp fire im not even going to try and recollect all the saturn games i just lost i guess i am a new emulation fag whats the best saturn emulator
  different guy here but i imagine the other guy was cringing at your brethren before wenches printout on the wall
i also have an nes but it needs a good cleaning
  it amused me when i first saw it and was really into dark souls  and i was thinking he probably referred to the samus mousepad
rate
  could have at least posted your emulation station
  he technically did
  barret in the front row
  having only one battlestation  having a shit tier battlestation
  heres my other one
  does your bedroom door say no girls allowed on it
  does it make any difference   serious question      ofcourse not  im not an average /r9k/ dweller  just because i treasure the bonds of male friendship does not mean i despise women
  cringe
  
  get mednafen sat bios  med launcher its a biatch to set up but once its running its running
  not pictured spiders
  fuck
i know the wire management is pretty terrible but ill get around to fixing that soon ive been reorganizing recently
  it was better before
    what time is it in australia
  some australian pad
  hdtv  disgusting faggot
  dont have room for a crt and i enjoy my modern games too is using a crt filter on my emulators good enough
  will check it out thanks
approaching its final form just need to figure out something for that big box of sega games and miscellaneous hardware recently got a sony editing vcr for ten bucks and nabbed all my old tapes from my parents the picture is way nicer than most people would have you remember vhs for the problem is that most peoples final memories of standard definition media were seen through the awful processing and upscaling on early lcd/plasma screens      does it make any difference   serious question  ignore the memers putting characters in the back row makes them less likely to be targeted but it also halves their damage output unless the character has a longrange weapon like barrett
  unless the character has a longrange weapon like barrett  well shit thats good to know playing the game blind has its drawbacks it seems    also miring your battle station dude
  there are three characters wuth long range weapons barret yufi and vincent there is also a long range materia that gives the long range ability to a character that doednt have a long range weapon
  cringe
  thanks its been a slow build over the last several years most expensive thing was the big audio amp    i just got done playing ffvii a couple of months ago pressing select on the battle screen brings up a little description menu for abilities items and targets and if you ever get caught in a backattack tap the shoulder button to start running away but release it your dudes will turn around so they wont take double damage from enemy attacks and if multiple characters are ready for their turn at the same time you can press triangle to pick who you want to go next oh and you can use l and r while running to go diagonally
  fuck no
  oh and you can transfer materia directly between characters even those not in your party by moving the cursor to arrange and pressing confirm itll give you the option to exchange materia super helpful if you didnt read the instruction manual
      i should reread the game manual  thanks for the helpful tips
  go ahead and guess whats been on my mind lately
  is that a bvm or a pvm2030
  pvm2530 actually
  woah
  nice thats a great looking set anon do the pvmxx30 sets have built in amps
  they do yeah meant for 8ohm passive speakers i havent gotten around to hooking some up some to mine since ive been planning out how to rearrange the setup in the nearish future
  i like it what size monitor is that ive got a 20inch for my main setup but ive always wanted to have a small monitor on my computer desk with just an nes or something      i will never understand battlestations like this looks so inconvenient looks like someone just wants to be able to say they own crts
  i am truly sorry for your lots
  based and libertypilled      op has best battlestation tbqh        why would you guys use such hilariously tiny crt screens i have never seen such tiny screens outside of a sparebedroom bw crt in my aunts house in 1989
  they fell hard for the pvmeme
  i mean i get it screen quality matters and i understand some people find pvm screens nicer to look at but surely its plainly obvious  as it has been to every consumer buying a screen for the last 65 years  that bigger is better why the fuck would someone be so deluded as to use a 12 screen just because the colors are slightly better absolute madness
  so how does that work does the sound signal go into the monitor through the db25 input then out through a separate audio output
  i think everyone would agree with you that bigger is better which is why larger broadcast monitors are more sought after than smaller ones but in looking for larger ones you sometimes run into smaller ones that are cheap enough to warrant a purchase id buy a 13 for 20 i think picking up any tv bigger than 25 is a pretty big commitment even if free itll be taking up a decent amount of space and require moderate effort to move around broadcast monitors are also much more likely to have the more high end input connections people want
  db25 can carry audio over its pinout what youre supposed to do from that point is use speaker wire from there to connect to the pvms internal amp to output audio via passive speakers    since i havent gotten around to doing that yet im presently bypassing the 2530 entirely for audio and outputting to a set of external speakers via 35mm wire im planning on using it as intended with the internal amp after the rearrangement
  neat
  why the fuck would someone be so deluded as to use a 12 screen just because the colors are slightly better absolute madness  the issue is at such a small size the increased quality of the image is highly debatable especially when at this point in time image quality is more dependent on the condition of the monitor and how much abuse it has seen over the years of course a lot of people just caught wind of the pvm craze and didnt really do any research beyond that and dont really understand the nuances of analog video displays the 20 ones have been prohibitively expensive for many years at this point so a lot of people just settled for the cheaper smaller ones      but in looking for larger ones you sometimes run into smaller ones that are cheap enough to warrant a purchase  yeah but ive noticed even those prices are going up 13 inch monitors are going for what a 20 used to cost and people are starting to get triple digits for 8inchers which is just absurd  i think picking up any tv bigger than 25 is a pretty big commitment  this ive used crts my whole life around 2009 i picked up a couple of 32 and 36 inch crts that were gorgeous and fun to play on but just too goddamn big and heavy id say 27 is as big as i would go now especially as a secondary gaming display because you can sit as close as you want and size is relative
  its a 14n5u if i remember rightim not home rn  its 14 inch only has composite and svideo but imo its more than enough  i won mine at an ebay auction for 25  loving it so far
  its a great crt for my desk anon
  nice game boy anon
  i just checked its 14n5e  im considering reselling it and move everything retro related to one place  and no i wont ask an absurd price for it  ill put it up for 30 and after haggling ill get 20 for it maybe
  or mice
  gotta hand it to the trip fag giving prisoners in your rape dungeon a retro setup is pure class
  an nes  an nintendo entertainment system  wat
  you write it as it would sound if spoken  an en ee ess  an em are eye  an es tee dee
  nice ricky martin poster
  typo
  hell yeah
  youre speaking incorrectly
    comfy as all heck  99/10 would game with
  whats with the oddly positioned couch does it actually get any use
    less damage also means the limit bar will take longer to fill i have barrett in the front row for that reason
  now im itching to play it again and im on vacation  and yeah i wouldnt trade the limits for less dmg   they are a god send
  if this pic was not in a battlestation thread i would have sworn this pic was taken in the late 90s early 00s
    the game isnt really hard enough for using rows or limit breaks to even make a difference
just moved into my first house   my retro room is work in progress but its starting to get comfy  been collecting since before it was a thing so most this was dirt cheap
  psx turned sideways and jammed between tvs
  the laser going out i have a replacement but figured id get as much out of it as possible before replacing it it conveniently got there theres a ps2 behind it
  are you even aware what function an performs  its all about phonetics remember that written forms are just a faulty tool to try and record speech
  my man
  i dont do so for difficulty but in order to learn all limit techniques quicker
  jaguar  for what purpose also is that grey console just under your flatscreen a 3do
  exactly same tought maybe he had the nonlong range weap in hand atomic scissors
  if you had someone with a long range weapon barret you could put him in the back row to get half the dmg received and still output the same amount of dmg
  no its a philips cdi i was given by local game shop ended up buying the shitty mario for it for the shits and gigglesi have a 3do though not set up cause no games i dont have otherwise
  this might be my favorite pvm model i dont know anything about the specs but aesthetically its the coolest i assume it was used for medical purposes
  i also have one of those monitors    truly belongs in the toilet horrible meme piece of shit
  what animu is that looks familiar
  jojo
  i have one of those  no you dont you are bitter cunt
i just got done renovating my room     1/2
    2/2
      3/2    this was my old setup
  whats the monitor
  what crt is that friend
    pvm2030 was a local pickup which was nice
  nice ive got the same model but havent set it up yet    how do you like it
    its great once set up it needs a special dongle for rgb though     it seems to have a builtin amp as well hence the speaker wire connections     my only complaint is its not as robust as other models for image settings and callibration the buttons on the front is pretty much what you got
  nice collection but vertically stacked games are aids such a pain to pull a game out to play it    looks cluttered as fuck
  i think there should be more adjustment potentiometers under the enclosure but am not sure what did you do about the db25 connector
  yes i do here it is safely tucked away in storage
  same for me senpai getting nostalgic for those times now
  whoa neat microwave
i enjoy seeing these battle stations but i would never have one just imagining all the dust and care for each piece of it  imagine if im moving then jfc i will be a emulator fag forever its too convenient just carrying my laptop anywhere i go
  do you get eyestrain having your eyes pressed against the glass
  not the other guy but 100 youre pronouncing nes like a fucking hillbilly if you arent saying the n enough to warrant a over an are you a hillbilly anon
  thatll kill the laser you know  itll stop reading discs
  when you say you play games on the toilet
  that christmas tree and the whole decorum reminded me of that time before y2k dont know why    anyway really nice settup
    i use this guy here the csync version specifically     i always get my cables with csync built in so its not necessary but i reccomended it just to be future proof     though shipping took a while since im a burger customer seevice on twitter is phenomenal     the audio breakouts can be connected straight to a reciever too which saves you money on an extra breakout dongle    
  my 300 ebay find doesnt need to be turned sideways to work
        will any chinese replacement laser work im thinking about picking up a replacement laser to future proof a little but all im finding is chinese stuff
  enjoy your neck cancer
windows 10 pc/tablet hybrid     emulators   old pc/gog games   indie games    supports hdmi out and i can use retroarch on my modern tv with crt shaders   has a keyboard mount with 2 regular usb ports and can use all kinds of pc accessories like wired controllers and mice   supports bluetooth controllers   is also a small windows laptop    i love this thing
  funny story i recently played all the way through ff7 on a beatup ps1 and never had a problem then one weekend my friend and i tried to marathon it on the ps4 version and it froze as we were getting into the elevator on shinra tower and we lost an hour of progress
  doesnt the audio signal go through the scart into through the db25 then back out through the speaker wire terminals
    yep but those terminals suck so i just wire it straight to a stereo reciever
    what makes it so bad was actually on the market for one of these
  its probably just old meaning low tvl350 and no osd thats just speculation though  i dont know the model number
is there anything i can do to reverse phosphor decay i play a lot of 5th and 6th gen horror games and seeing artifacts everytime im in a dark setting is really disorienting
  stored next to a speaker magnet
    mine is the kx14cp1 so has scart but it is extremely picky with sync as speculated it has no osd which isnt a problem with my profeels but this thing has no way to adjust the horizontal centering at all so if its off thats your lot    it also feels extremely cheap and flimsy in no way correspondent with the prices being asked for them
  ill just degauss it with my heavy duty wand when i find a sucker willing to buy it thats a 5 speaker with a tiny magnet in a shielded enclosure though so i doubt itll even be necessary
    thank you guys this is very good information are there any other monitors that have a similar look that you recommend really digging the aesthetic of this which is the main reason i was eyeballing it
    yeesh what an eyesore
  the pvm models of the 80s have a copy style but again they have relatively low tvl counts the 1910 is pretty cool but has a tvl count of 350 the 2030 is also pretty sweet and has a tvl of 560 but is typically priced pretty high  the pvm/bvm jvc and ikegami monitors of the late 90s onward all tend to have a similar industrial look to them pic related lated its a 1910
    if this is renovated i hate to think what it was like bef      oh
  unframed vidya posters  dont tread on me  the irony of having that next to a cheech and chong poster  get a load of this faggot
  teehee im a libertarian dont hit on me silly boys 
    fuck off kikes
    go swallow your dads cum faggot
  camo print anything  maximum gay
  nice crt anon ignore these niggers
  theres literally nothing contradictory between having a cheech n chong poster and a gadsden flag
  thank you
  id say 27 is as big as i would go now  my brother has a 36 sony and though it looks good it is a beast i stuck with a 27 console    the 20 ones have been prohibitively expensive for many years at this point  i never pay more than 30 for a crt and have upgraded about once a year for the last 5 years i am at the point where i cant see too much more for me that i would enjoy the one project i have for my console television is to remove the base that the set rotates on which is limited to an estimated 3545 degrees of rotate total at that point i have a great set of heavy duty casters that i will install lots of my retro gaming is done via the wii it is just too handy of a system for anyone with a crt   you should take that flag and a damp towel and run it in the clothes drier on low/no heat it should help take the creases out of it did you paint that xbox retro emulator or is that stickers i painted mine in red to match my wii for no reason other than that is the color my kid picked
  different anon but neat flag trick
heres my humble setup i like it but i dont have anywhere to actually sit my consoles and im not sure what to do with them just the one is already slightly sitting off the edge but i have a snes and a ps1 id like to use too
  different anon but neat flag trick  it works with clothes i have a few shirts that no matter how you hang them they will wrinkle manmade materials can melt at high drier heat so it works that way its not a flag trick so much as a way to not iron a shirt but to have all the wrinkles out of it hell i have tossed entire suits in the drier due to poor storage    old pic somewhat related
  love the set up desk stations like this are good for using 1 console at a time if you want to connect all of your consoles at once i think an entertainment center type set up would be better this looks really good already though if you just focus on one console at a time
  i like it but i dont have anywhere to actually sit my consoles and im not sure what to do with them  perhaps a shelf across the middle of the window above your monitors anchor it on the right and left side of the window
finally got my setup complete i dont have anywhere to put the n64 though when im not using it i just store it in an old snare drum carrying case
  i may be a sucker willing to buy it where you at

  you have to go back
      the only one triggered about the flag is   who mentioned it first it triggered you that much about the flag that you just had to insult him about it going as far to tell him to kill himself because oh le snek flag ew i gotta insult him to upset him lololol pretty edgy m8 honestly youre a pathetic 
lol people arguing about a flag on /vr/ this isnt /pol/
  blister on the wall  wat
i have diarrhea
    see    and    if you are going to post your battlestation on /vr/ you better not post your shitty /pol/ memes along with it that is what the flag is its a retarded meme for retarded people it has no place on /vr/ fuck off and stop whining when you get called out for your faggotry

  more on topic my battlestation
  this guy gets it
  its too bad no one cares what you think huh
  ouch
  do you have any pics of whats left im sorry you had to go through that im honestly terrified that someday a natural disaster might come through and destroy everything including my collection
  nintendo toys  mario hat   street fighter hat  cords and controllers in a fucking mess    messy manchild/10 kys
  has potential but as another anon stated very messy you gotta reduce some of that wire clutter my dude just seeing it triggers my ocd

going up
  that window is so asian
  how embarrassing
setup is really cramped most of our systems are in the bedroom until we eventually get a bigger place our bed is directly behind the couch
  beside the tv
  yellow snes shell  thats nasty man
    i got my crt from an old lady in my neighborhood who wanted to get rid of it    sorry about the bad quality
  i couldnt care less
  neat tv next up you should look for a stand for it and your systems
  fixing airsoft gun and giving it new paint job
  buys an expensive pvm  uses shitty logitech speakers  why pretend to care about visual quality beyond a consumer tv if you dont care about audio quality
  are you hacker from the future
  whats actually wrong with logitech   ive had them for a few years now and they serve me well enough  its still better than the pvms mono speaker and untill i find a pair of nice sony speakers they will do  i dont have any idea what to get anyway im not that good with sound systems feel free to po8nt me in the right direction if youre so good at it    also i paid more for the speakers to begin with 55
  go to a goodwill or craigslist and find a decent receiver that supports up to component for video routing and also supports dolby prologic 2 decoding now find five speakers that arent crap and a subwoofer once you hear games coming out of real speakers youll realize why people shit on those tiny cheap logitech speakers if you arent sure how to judge speakers just look up reviews and if its at least a 3/5 youre fine try to avoid entry level consumer crap like a sony surround sound setup get speakers from a brand that makes speakers as their business or one that has a reputation in the industry like yamaha sony doesnt btw
  anything from the silver age pre 1980 is great pioneer sx 525 is a good choice they are cheap and rather easy to fix they where also entirely hand built
    thanks senpai  im european so no goodwill or graigslist here as far as im aware  ill browse instead the local ebay and facebook marketplace looking for a good deal  i wasnt interested anyway in any surround system they never appealed to me  a receiver with 2 speakers would be more than enough for my needs i dont have the space for 5 speakers and a subwoofer but if i find something nice ill get it and deal with space issues later    on a somewhat related topic how do you power all your devices  mine are all plugged into extension chords that go into only 2 wall power outlets  it works but my limited knowledge of electronics tell me its kinda unsafe
  you would have letgo or gumtree available or perhaps a local version of such local classifieds      i use power bars split across separate outlets extension cables are perfectly fine so long as they are not frayed or cheaply made i dont know about plugging bars into extension cables though ive always been told not to so i avoid that
  most of us here use ebay kleinanzeigen or facebook  ive never heard of the other two    well sound like i need to invest in some extension chords and power bars
  i plugged a power bar into a short extension cord one of the ones you use for christmas lights i had to cut the ground off the power bar for it to work once the first bar filled up i plugged a second bar into the first bar all my stuff crt tv 6 consoles vcr dvd playet and a 1970s alarm clock is plugged in to the daisy chained power bars with the exception of my 2600     probably not the safest but its been like that for years so whatever
  optimum
  taking high risks there anon
  tell me about the controller im looking to do the same thing with a hd fire tab dose it have l3 and r3
        dont be mean i tore the walls and ceilings down and even redid the electrical from scratch doubling my outlets
  i can understand the autistic ocd behind the messy cords but since they dont prevent me to play my games i couldnt fucking care  could you elaborate on the nintendomanchild meme  i need a good laugh
  i know i could just put all controllers in a box somewhere actually i may do that
  lurking in a thread about grown ups showing their toys is not embarrassing
  i figure as long as i dont ever try to turn on everything at once ill be okay
  a lot of particle board shelfing in here not great but you have a nice vectrex
  true but in case of a power surge it will affect all of them  id unplug everything you rarely use to lighten up the load
  well i didnt feel like having 50kgs wood shelves under the 50kgs of crt  thanks for noticing the vectrex indeed its a lot of fun and buzz
  well give it enough time and the 50kgs of crt will be inside of those shelves
  i bought a ups cause one night i had my snes get shorted by a electrical storm also lost my hdtv but the crt held up i used to just not plug in everything due to concern about the power packs warming up but now i suppose having the little bit of protection i leave most plugged in now
  with the vertical panel just under the crt i highly doubt it
  dat little yellow carrito on the tv  kek
  so you have a time machine interesting
  so do you normally keep your setup on your outside patio where the elements can damage your system

    my uncles home was like this an absolute mess filled with good shit when he died some druggies broke into his home and stole everything before anyone had a chance to go through it all
    damn this is bad the xeye doesnt even make up for this
  that was family of yours that did that lawyers/police will confirm that when a family member dies it is always family taking from them
  just hand me downs
  comfy post more
  nice just missing some bud
  its comfy even when i first moved in but it held furniture well
  nah everyone in the area was present and accounted for everyone that wasnt either lived half the state or half the country away and no one was destitute enough to try that anyways we were guessing it was probably one of his later acquaintances or someone he once rented a room to that did the deed he was handicapped from an accident in the late 80s but had a stubborn independence streak so he ended up trying to keep a home on his own despite being unable to work fulltime which in turn led to him renting out to lessthan reputable types in an already shitty area    to keep this blog post somewhat ontopic i guess seeing that happen left me with a faint lingering fear that i might end up the same dead and with nothing to be remembered by pass on or even have sold to benefit my family because everything was just straight up robbed and likely distributed among dozens of pawnshops if not discarded in some drainage canal he had good sized snes genesis saturn psx and 64 collections that he had owned since they were new tons of pcs/components and monitors stretching from the early 90s to the then present late 00s some memorabilia and a lot of old photos and videos saved to media of all sorts but not so much paper  all just gone i might be a collectorfag but i have no illusions of taking it with me when i go or having it appreciate in value like crazy but where it does go is still important to me i guess the only moral of the story is to be careful of who you associate with
    fucken nice this is a true battlestation good job anon
  that really sucks anon im sorry
r8
  is that a gameboy player for the playstation 1  gameshark flashed with unirom      i dont need your shitty advice on how to take care of my things  no problem my friend i was just sharing a trick that has helped me out in my life granted i use it for suits and dress clothes and no i dont use any drugs or even alcohol but a real libertarian wouldnt judge me if i did the carpet isnt dirty it is a very thick carpet and if it is not pushed in the same direction it takes light different dont be mad brother it was constructive criticism that your flag looks brand new fresh out of the bag
  ive got the duke bust as well its sits on the dash of my cadillac
  what kind of person your uncle was seemed like an interesting guy
  this is how all anons with tate setups live
  autism/10
    clean your room you fucking slob
    rated very highly
  op doesnt care for his/her shit or this is a poor mexican setup
  i will never understand battlestations like this    there is a lot of battlestations and rooms that i seen that i dont understand and just want to say why my dads girlfriends sons room was retarded as shit
  how can you comfortably play that where do you sit
    
  sometimes i feel like my game room gets cluttered but then i see stuff like this and i immediately feel better about myself and my room
  piss jars
  i somehow like this kind of messy places
  this room looks like it may have been in good condition a decade ago the combination of social isolation and undiagnosed mental illness have taken its toll
    its like i can feel the depression
you are all fucking niggers
new tv how does it look
  i feel bad for this anon that this is just his normal he probably saw nothing wrong with this before uploading  ive been there before never again
  looks good anon
  you are all fucking niggers  ayy motha fucka das races nigga
  looks like it has input lag
  i think the idea of it is good but definitely dont like the oversized stand taking up so much space replace that with a nice slim tv stand shelf and speaker system    mostly i am wondering about that door opening up with the stand in the way
  i can see your nintendo switch peekin out on the left
  input lag  leave /vr/ you fucking idiot
  thanks      it doesnt      yea the stand doesnt fit my new tv as well but after carrying that beast of a television up a flight of stairs to get it there i dont feel like moving any furniture anytime soon the doors are an issue as they cant open all the way but i have lived with it for a while now and it doesnt really bother me      worst purchase of my life hands down 4/6 games i bought are still sealed because i have no motivation to play it even outside of the house i use my psp i havent turned on my switch in like 8 months
  anon here my clutter is a result of collecting for the past 20 years i simply have nowhere else to put anything all those drawers you see are filled with games my closet is filled with consoles games and video tapes i work 2 jobs and simply dont have the time or energy to straighten it up besides ive seen much worse at other friends houses rooms that you have to contort your limbs in unnatural positions in order to access anything     also i do a lot of trouble shooting of computers and electronics in that room so i keep wires easy to access so i dont lose time digging them out i am very selective of guests who go in that room only very close friends are allowed in that room in those drawers are hundreds and hundreds of games ive accumulated yes i could sell them and stick with everdrives but to me finding and obtaining each game is a lot of fun by itself
disgusting mess part 1
  disgusting shelf
  a ps2 collection like this intrigues me theres a ton of serious rpgs and only one western game theres no vice city or ace combat 4
    i dont see how anyone could have a ps2 collection like that i have around 150 ps2 games and not one rpg
      im a definite fan of those franchises i just havent been getting and playing alot of ps2 games my ps2 collection started recently after a friend sold me a lot of his collection im not even a huge jrpg fan just a fan of persona and digital devil saga
  clean that fucking screen you vile creaton
  very nice looking setup looks comfy and that tv is fucking huge is it 32
  is that the chapo guide to revolution i see on the right
  i dont understand why americans had nice ps2 boxes and europeans shitty generic ones that make every ps2 pal collection look ugly as fuck from the shelves
  post you bubbad funs i know you have them
  1 minute to the next station  840m left  30km/h  game over
my ass up and left me while losing weight so sitting in computer chairs is incredibly uncomfortable is there any such thing as having a super tall recliner or something all the office chairs people recommend being as super comfortable still arent padded enough for me only couches seem to be fine
  i recognize the dude weed lmao but what is the other illicit merchandise on display here  anyone care to enlighten my innocent ass
  36 set is a sony wega kv36fs120
recently tried the wii for emulation and holy shit this is fucking godtier my trinitron is in pal eurofag so i cant play my famicom / ntsc games on it my wii enables me to play all the ntsc games on my pal system y through emulation
  poorfag detected      yes anon it is good enough dont listen to that elitist faggot
  yes it is had to read it for a college class and i fucking loved it been binging their podcast ever since i finished it    i usually wouldnt complain cause i like how unified the switchs spines are but the pal spines are so boring i keep thinking theyre gamestop boxes
  love when an image is the right rotation on the preview but just turns for no reason
  strangely relieving to see someone who listens to cth post on here
  its actually really easy to clean a monitor screen just get a paper coffee filter and dampen it under the tap wipe until the water starts evaporating
  what leveno thing is that is it the type to come with a bluetooth keyboard  does it do steam would it play cuphead
  just reorganized made extra space by moving the huge pc game boxes somewhere else
  i love battle stations like this i have a hard time playing old games but i love looking at them and watching people play i need a bf to show off his set up to me
  thanks but whats with the containers next to the scale
  their podcast is the only one i love enough to support with my own money    same
how well do non 1080p monitors handle game consoles  id like a 1440p or 1200 for general use but not if i cant play games properly  im fine with black bars if this is the only drawback
    whats the game
  jesus anon use that scissor to cut your feet finger nails
  this post
  trim your fucking toenails damn dude your trap girlfriends legs probably look like she was mauled by a tiger
  i know its not exactly what youre asking but i use a 720p television for ps3 no problems
  vesperia ps4  doesnt that come out in january
  its clearly component you false nerd
  i was thinking more n64 or gamecube with the possibility of slightly more modern consoles    do you think there would be any issues with these  ive tried googling and all i got was emulation
  tell me more about this setup
    chapo trap house is gay cumtown is the patrician choice
  just when i am banging your mom
  i have a wega that does 1080i works perfectly with ps3 to play retro on obviously it does anything under 1080 input lag is a meme on my set at least and its a widescreen if there is input lag its minimal enough that you cant tell it on tight platformers like mr gimmick to be fair i dont use hdmi because the jack is broken or doesnt work for whatever reason component and svideo or even composite looks decent on it the only downside is it weighs 265 lbs so you better have a good back and a strong friend or two if you want to move it
people asking about hd sets it destroys 240p content  if youre playing 480p its fine and 480i upscaling is debatable but if the tv doesnt display 480i natively then it is obliterating your scanlines and ruining the look of the game
lil college setup using the saturn for darius gaiden music right now

my god this fucking thread is still here
    indeed an mx4000 if the meme is being followed to the letter
  and it will continue to be here as long as you keep bumping it to the top by making new comments
  irc on phone while driving
  how new are you there are threads in the catalog that have been up for over 100 days
  is this the greatest dialogue choice in video game history  terrible thread and it will not die
i keep all my systems in the cab
  you sound triggered
  not at all
  that shelf is a disaster waiting to happen
  im not the dicks who were mean but my honest opinion is all those carts look bad they would look much nicer in drawers with only a few of your favorites on display right now it has a pawn shop aesthetic not a cool game room one if seeing all the carts makes you happy thats fine but i think they would look better away from your tv whether on a bookshelf type unit or in a drawer im talking specifically about the ones around the monitor the ones on the left shelving arent too bad
  stacking games  sure do what you gotta do to save spa  stack of 30 games  christ well if you keep your favorites at the top theyre still easy to g  boxes and shit on top of games  no fuck this these games are never going to be played again
  funko pops
  lookin good but i think it would look better if you put something on the back so you didnt see the wall around the television you can buy thin board like is in the back of the glassed in parts at most big home improvement stores i forget what its called but you could probably get it to match your entertainment center if you cant find it even tightly stretched black cloth would look good
  looks much nicer good job anon
  its not bad anon but i feel saddened by those cartridges bearing the weight of all the others
  whats he going to do if that water tank bursts
  shelves warping
  i think he lives in his car
  hopefully no modern ones thats a good way to make them overheat
  i think hes fine its already leakingnotice the big bin beneath it to catch the water so it probably cant build up sufficient pressure to explode
  thank heavens i finally realized that this was the after picture and that  and  are the after pictures i kept looking at the last one you posted and the more i looked at it the more nervous i got
  this was the before picture and that 5162732 and 5162735 are the after pictures
  piss in generic ketchup bottles
plan to build a side cabinet for a few more consoles i live w a wahmin so the inhouse retro station has to be small as possible
  based richie rich
  god i have so much nostalgia for those wooden console tvs i grew up with a zenith from the mid 1980s that unit must have lasted nearly 25 years
  are those parrots melting
  nothing in that picture cost more than 400
  quiet nazi
  i love it super comfy those old gigantic wooden console tvs are great
      matt will and virgil did a video chat with the class just today matt seemingly just woke up since he was laying in bed with his laptop and basicly gave no input will and virgil were super fun to banter with though
    i thought it was a camera flash effect but they still look melty in this daylight pic _ツ_/ doesnt look that dramatic in person
      yep didnt realize i didnt specify same corner of the room too
  a true classic
  why the hell are the cords coming out the front instead of being routed behind the cabinet
  is that an original dark side of the moon pressing
  i dont know much about vinyls so im not sure its pretty beat up i got this at an old thrift store
  vinyls
  this setup legit gives me anxiety just looking at it just some things i would do to organize it better    i would get more sorting bins for extra controllers/accessories and either put them on the bottom shelves if you use them regularly any ones you dont use much just hide away in a closet this includes fightsticks put any consoles that fit under the tv and the rest on the shelves the ones you use most on the same level as the tv unless youre regularly playing the 2600 pack that shit away or display it on the top of the shelf same goes with your playstation since you have a ps2 already throw away that power supply    and for gods sake keep all your games in one place
      setup complete    integrated vhs tv    using the frontmount composite video in mono
      fakeretro flatbrims    yikes
  thanks for the tips  the problem is both the shelf and the tv tray are both legacy furniture that came with the apartment and i havent found anything that i like and fits in the space its a corner of the living room    the psu is fucking annoying as fuck but i need it for the amstrad cpc until i get a proper rgbpsu cable set 
  door blocked by furniture  i hope you get a really big boo boo
all these disgusting flat crts
  this desu
  bruh the door swings inwards youre going to chip either the door or the cabinets
  looks like chris old room
    its not a problem sorry for shit quality but i just took it on my phone
  heres two more      i agree they are awful
  simple subtitles and sometimes even the full titles of games would be translated into a specific language in europe being too lazy to graphically adjust the logo they went for a uniform and boring look same reason why pal manuals are all grey while japan the na got colorful ones i wish they just kept things like they used to be and released every game over here in english because fuck those brainlets who cant into 2 or more languages
does vr like movies
  oh hi mr plinkett
  whats wrong with flat crts
  it probably just boils down to not being as nostalgic as those old woodpaneled sets from the 70s/80s
miss you buddy
    bet your tan is fucking awesome
  yea boi
  
  same here man it fucking sucks
  good thing i can crane my neck 165 degrees from that gulag you call a couch and god forbid i should have to hit reset
    youre the new michael jackson
    thanks that actually make sense     fuck those brainlets who cant into 2 or more languages    you dont need to tell me in my country every discussion about any game that doesnt come dubbed becomes an endless complaining in a matter of minutes
  nice korbo my dude
    thank you my brothers ive got the 10th anniversary statue on preorder as well if only the series were old enough to have /vr/ games ironically it is getting a vr game

  get ready  i am ready
when it comes to /vr/ why do people suddenly try to jew you down so hardcore is it because /vr/ and /v/ in general attracts poor fags i recently had some stuff listed not a big lot but quite a bit of obscure things ranging from /vr/ to /v/ stuff you just werent going to walk into a store and buy and if you did find it second hand it was going to be mangled factory sealed ps1/ps2 titles consoles with untouched manuals pristine boxes and all the plastic everything came wrapped in etc i was asking for 1000 but if you were to take the time and sell yourself literally could go for 2500 or more but the people that message you just lowball you from the start and when you turn them down beg you to take their offer shit is annoying    /vr/ selling horror stories thread
  0/troll  when it comes to /vr/ why do people suddenly think their stuff is worth so much is it because /vr/ attracts ban wagoners i recently posted on /vr/ pretending i had recently listed a bunch of shit i never had i said i was asking 1000 but if you were to take the time and sell yourself literally could go for 2500 or more i imagined out loud how poor people like me might react when communicating with a seller who actually had the stuff  ftfyk
  poor fag detected dont you need to go to bed to hit some garage sales in the morning
  are you listing on ebay the reason for some of that is the best offer culture ive offered quite a bit down on some things and negotiated a price much lower than initial ask presumably because the seller was on a fishing expedition and was obviously willing to take much less via backandforth negotiation this has probably trained many people to offer low with the assumption that the seller will counter honestly i think this is a somewhat dangerous tactic for the seller especially if they drastically overprice their initial ask because it scares away some people who just assume that the seller is crazy and expecting the very large majority of their inflated ask when really they might take only 60 of it     just make a counter offer and see what happens if they wont budge just decline their offer and ignore them
  1000 bucks  worth around 2500  surprised when scalpers try and undercut the shit out of you
  i have a complete boxed copy of mega man 8 for the sega saturn which comes to a bit less than 400 leafbux on ebay the disc is scratched and it causes cutscenes to skip i was thinking of getting it repaired/resurfaced soon and seeing how much the local /vr/ stores are willing to pay
    1000 dollarydoos    why on earth would you try to sell this much stuff as a single bundle sell it piece by piece not only will you make more in the long run but you wont have to deal with scalpers contacting you ever 40 minutes to say but will you take 35 cents instead
  im trying to finish med school and dont have the time to deal with it honestly
    what kind of stuff are we talking
  rule of rose ps2 factory sealed its one thing out of the lot i had listed shenmue dreamcast factory sealed as well its not like ive got just a cd binder with shit yknow
    these items are horrible to sell in a lot only scalpers will take any notice if you sold them individually at a reasonable price theyd have been gone already it may take a little more time but the way youre doing it now obviously isnt working
  is it because /vr/ and /v/ in general attracts poor fags    on the contrary i find /vr/ is populated by a considerable amount of people with disposal income to blow on hard to find and expensive titles
fuck off scalpers hope all your stuff get fried on em radiation  t poorfag
  projectingfag detected projecting even harder  its hilarious how poorfags cry when anyone doesnt overpay for the shit they overpaid for      in what third world shithole would 1k make a dent in the cost of finishing med school larpistan
1 bowsers sub in mario 64
bowser may have attempted to enter peachs backdoor
  first post best post
  a portion of the backdoor had to be remodeled with brown bricks  what  the  fuck
  i honestly thought that was the entire point of the image
shut the fuck up and post more vidya secrets
  why are psyduck and golduck randomly there
  because golduck is blue and psyduck is golden
  fag
  well bubbles kind of makes for a stupid picture so that was a good improvement but it does explain why the jolly roger bay picture is way better than pretty much all the other ones    also you know whats weird is how supposedly bowser only enchanted the paintings so you could go through them but then big boos haunt tick tock clock and rainbow ride are all entered by ways other than paintings
  came to post this glad /vr/ is still on point
  chikorita was the cutest pokemon of all time dont  me
  building brown bricks with minecrap
  i said well be remodeling your shithole
  i love that aesthetic so much  that checkered floor brick wall weird lighting cloud frescoes  feels dreamier than ever
  magikarp to dragonite is complete bullshit

  how come i see you on pretty much every board
  what do you mean i mostly only post on /vr/ and /lgbt/ and sometimes /pol/ as well and /x/ and /tg/ and i think /v/ a few times and /co/ and /asp/ and oh shoot maybe youre right
      damn these posts are shitty you didnt blow anything you fag go the fuck back to /lgbt/ if you dont know what youre doing and stop tripfagging when not necessary pls
  you didnt blow anything   you fag  that seems highly unlikely
lots of video games have a jason vorhees like character
  front door is red and tan  back door is brown  really makes you think
  he thinks this is the correct color of female genitalia  yikes
imagine being tetra and suddenly gaining the power to become white whenever you want must be nice
  dang i never noticed that thanks bro youre a mans man
  i too the it had to ber remodelled with brown bricks part strongly suggests it
  the bubbles are cooler imo
  front door has two flaps and a red carpet
  yeah i saw that post on /v/ too    i like when people try to steal someone elses post and it completely fails
  dragonite has the same feeler things too but on its head
  why dont you visit the /omg/ anymore
did you know
  put me in the screencap phams
  who does he think he is jeeeezussss
  he doesnt look a thing like jesus
  eon  eon  eon  gon  no
  i think its neat that shy guys are just such a cool design that they became a permanent fixture in the mario series thanks to this game despite not actually originating in a mario game and yeah i know theres a few others but its interesting to look at just how many characters from that game basically never showed up again like mouser
  bullshit  the picture
  vaguely canine appearance  its a fucking duck
  shut the fuck up the post
  faggot  the reply
  always wondered what the bridge was meant for that would make sense
hahaha he pointed out the clear and obvious joke in the image
  shut the fuck up
  4chan posters are some of the dumbest most easily amused people on the planet its really no surprise

questions
  the ironing
  its spelled irony you idiot learn to spell
  whats funny to me about the its not a real mario crowd is that if we compare smw and smb2 they will be closer than you might think yes it lack coinboxes and warp pipes are cosmetically replaced with vases but otherwise the core gameplay of smb2 is closer to modern mario than you might think more forgiving multiple hitpoints instead of twostage health before in smb1 when you got hit as fire mario you reverted straight to small mario picking up items picking up enemies and throwing them to attack koopas bobombs and galoombas anyone keys and locks system bosses where you have to pick up their own projectiles and throw them back at the boss even enemies like shyguys and bobombs    smb2 is now retroactively as much of a mario game as smb1 ironically enough even plucking turnips made a comeback in captain toad
in mega man x3 sigma was originally going to have a more onmodel appearance in line with what he looked like in x and x2 complete with detailed animations but for some reason this design was scrapped in favor of the minimally animated pinhead version we got in final retail game
  good he looks like a toy from the dollar store
  well at least they had him accurately proportioned and not just jerking from pose to pose with very few and in one case no inbetween frames
    like one of those over the top batman action figures where he looks nothing like how he ever did in any comics shows etc    this is clawcapehell sigma he comes with a glow in the dark shield and if you press a button on his back his yellow tits light up dustbuster x sold seperately only from mattel
maybe youve noticed that huitzil looks weird during the first frame of his final guardian super thats because this sprite is actually a backup robot that in the original version of the super would come falling in from the top of the screen and transform into the turret which huitzil would then fire   footage at 245  this sprite somehow found its way into the finalized version of the move where huitzil himself transforms
  this meme pic needs to be updated with the fact the back entrance is specifically brown and the front entrance is a double door
  no it doesnt retard
  i mean magical portals like warp pipes etc do exist in mario universe  i guess princess peach always had a hidden portal to a ghost house in her palace for some reason maybe it was ancient and built in the time when ghost house was just a regular house
  that might explain the rainbow ride portal but the bbh portal is like inside a boo that only appears when you have a certain number of stars so i dunno how you would explain that
  17333640  nintendo stole argonauts idea for a 3d platformer  they showed them a prototype where yoshi was the main character of this game and nintendo and miyamoto himself were like ohhh yessu dis izu verry good  then they dropped the entire thing told argonaut we nottu interesteddu any ronger whittu piggu and ripped all their ideas and made mario 64  then argonaut who were creatively bankrupt changed yoshi into croc and made him control like a tank and released him into the wild a year after mario   now the 45year old creepy plumber with a porn moustache dances on the grave of both croc and his own pet and crocsibling yoshi as the monopolic king of platformer games   next time you play mario 64 remember this story remember that the reason you dont have any good collectathon platformers anymore and mario is the only thing that strives in the genre was nintendo raping the white pigs stealing their wares and mocking them using an effigy of the white man to control the market and assert their authority   croc died for gamers sins
  youre deluded croc is a generic piece of shit with tank controls and no physics
  ive heard a similar story in regards to star fox 2 and 64 miyamoto used many of the ideas argonaut presented to him in private meetings and they never got any money out of it
  he certainly couldve enchanted the clock too the only thing i find weird is entering big boos haunt i guess bowser made the house tiny and put it in a cage and had a boo guard it but how the fuck does mario shrink down and jump inside a cage the size of his foot
  and why did he make it tiny anyway couldnt someone just step on it and release all the stars
  yes and it had to be remodeled afterwards with brows bricks  many autists cant comprehend double meaning and end up writing things like that

  weezing  sneezing  
  ekans is a species of snake native to the rhodesian highlands which produces a corrosive venom that the natives have used for centuries to clean bathroom grout  arbok was actually the name of a rare egyptian snake famous for being a favorite pet of cleopatras and being left a small fortune in her will
  weezing  sneezing
  mario 64 wipes the floor with both croc games
  fucking really gamefreak/nintendo of america thats some fucking crazy shit right here
  yeah thats a bit far fetched but so is magikarp becoming garidos that makes no sense why would a fish become a serpent i do think the venonat butterfree evolution and metapo to venamoth are way better looking the eyes and colors are too similar i can also see dragonair becoming garidos as they are both serpents if anything slowbro should have become dragonite and magikarp should have been a novelty pokemon that maybe slowbro has you eat in order to become a dragonite that makes more sense
  that makes no sense why would a fish become a serpent  1 its a dragon not a serpent  2 its japanese folklore check out koi fish myth
  1 its a dragon not a serpent  go suck a dick that thing is a serpent i dont care what the game calls it      2 its japanese folklore check out koi fish myth  well ok that checks out
  croc  croco    what the fuck nintendo
  why would a fish become a serpent  its not as retarded as this
  nobody used these shitty pokemons anyway
  you shouldnt try being funny
  the spaceworld demo explains that particular evolution a little better
  spaceworld demos are so weird iirc thats also where the oot ganondorf with a sword came from
  the difference being that the pokemon spaceworld demo was an early build of the game while the zelda thing was a 20 second long movie nintendo put together to show off the gamecubes graphical power
did you ever hear the human boo    as you all know the boo sound is just bowsers laugh slowed down but theres a chance that it will only slow it down 50 and you get a terrifying sound instead    
  that octillery looks great
  im not sucking anything my man
  whats sigma
  it actually fits with the name octillery or octank as its called in japanese    im not sure what they were thinking just changing it to a generic octopus
  a pistol evolving into a cannon you stupid nigger
  im sure it was just to make it less violent
  yeah it does if you havent played the spaceworld demos go do it its easily the coolest /vr/ thing to leak in years

  wat
  of course
  excuse me
  magikarp becoming gyrados is a reference to an old jap folk tale in which a koi swims upstream against a rapid river flow and scales a large waterfall becoming a dragon as a result they further reference this in pokemon snap its about tempering ones self through hardship and not underestimating the potential of the weak

  its the nonanimated version    hers a new mystery why does peach have blue fire in her basement
  a good question
  its hotter than the red fire
  to melt red ice with
    woah
  because the blue fire is waterproof obviously
    because nintendo knew everyone playing it was a shit head kid who wanted to know if it would burn them or not
not sure how well known this is but its possible to kill the regular big boos in super mario world but only by sliding into it via stairs or a cape    
  now this is a cool fact thanks anon

    but why is porygon based on a duck of all things also whats up with porygon being one of the rare pokemon whose name is the same in all languages also i know that the porygon episode was banned but its really weird that it and its evolutions never did anything in the anime after that even though its been twenty fucking years obviously they wouldnt use the strobe effects so what the fuck are they worried about someone being offended twenty years later i see no reason why they let this stop them from having a trainer use a porygonz in battle or something makes no sense

  bobomb battlefield cool cool mountain and tick tock clock have the same melody
  strange ive enjoyed most of the lotr games ive played
  yes im sure a man who has likely never made a video game and probably doesnt know anything about the companies with video games rights is the reason that ea cant make a good video game clearly
  you realize that first off its the developer not the publisher that makes the game and second ea hasnt had the rights to lord of the rings in like 10 years and its wb that does them now
      from four years ago but basically devs would have great ideas and then high level execs would come in and say make your already finished comfy hobbit game like dynasty warriors lolol while the estate would release last minute directives to make major changes to already completed aspects of games that didnt have the budget for the shit it boils down to executive meddling by precisely a bunch of people with no idea how to make games    some of the game ideas from the article were pretty cool too

  in a game where you can find peachs underwear or whatever the fuck it is im not surprised something like this is in there not ttyd levels of literally controlling a naked princess peach but smrpg had a good joke or two in this vein
  how else would she protect her eyes from my cum
  yuck
  ttyd levels of literally controlling a naked princess peach  this really happened
  yeah she turned invisible to sneak around so the clothes had to go
  that blew my mind when i first realised it cant believe i never noticed as a kid

    are you implying that bowser had to remodel her shithole
everyone finally shut the fuck up about the brown bricks  suddenly a new wave of retards pops up  did this thread get linked on reddit or what
  this dude only exists in the pc version of re3
  bit of a sad ending too in the tm2 comic pretm calypso aka william sparks was suicidal and had a shit life so he killed himself in a car crash along with his daughter    sad thing is that theres barely any hq screens for the character bios in the games since the twisted metal wiki didnt update them
  couldnt anyone just go and you know play the game and take the screenshots themselves
  theres some but thats on the gameplay side of things tm black however is inexcusable since the screenshots on the wiki is abysmal    also heres another high quality screen featuring motherfuckin axel
  theres not enough room left in this picture  literally 60 of it is whitespace

  i bought an odroidgo too op really comfy for playing gameboy/gamegear/gbc and most master system games also great battery life and good backlit screen however the nes emulaion is laggy as fuck and i just dont understand why doom runs perfectly smooth but mario bros is almost unplayable also it crashes a lot 7/10 would recommend but far from perfect
  on the gameboy player on my gamecube
  i use an emulator
aside from like 4 games the library is pretty trash with better alternatives for most games on actual consoles
  this    i used to use a hacked psp but that was 8 years ago and when it broke during that move it sort of broke my spirit and i havent really been able to find anyone who knows how to hack one since
i use my gb player for gc and my ags101 though i still havent found an comfortable affordable pad for the gbp
  i still havent found an comfortable affordable pad for the gbp  wii cc/pro  
  on a modded gameboy with a backlit screen
  please tell me you dont actually play gb games stretched like that  youre only hurting yourself anon

    i use my gba sp
someone know some neat smw hack ron
always liked return to dinosaur land if you want something more on the vanilla side
  kaizo ron only pls
i will check out return to dinosaur land looks great
  thanks for the suggestion dude have a nice dat
  no problem man its definitely a great hack especially if you arent too into the reworked graphics and music or insane difficulty of most hacks this one matches the feel of the original game really well although youll find some of the puzzles/secret exits a bit more elaborate
  im recently finished smw and searching for a new experiencesmw randomizer is helping but sometimes is impossibles to finish some levels so that is amazing for me im new in 4chan youre the last decent person here
  cheers mate hope you enjoy it there are some good people here still  otherwise i wouldnt keep coming around
this game is really good why is it never talked about here
  sometimes it pops up but i never saw it as a whole thread actually only fond mentions here and there i agree its a great game i loved when even the man himself played it
  whats this cutesy shit this isnt badass enough for a hardcore american gamer such as myself
  i used to shill it all the time its a great way for people to dip their toes into roguelikes and see if the genre appeals
  you reek of reddit go back
  t redditfag who doesnt understand a joke because he is too busy trying to seem cool to 4chan
roguelikes fucking suck
  i understood that you were trying to be funny  good god were you trying
  you suck at roguelikes
  i didnt even know this existed until recently i got shiren the wanderer for wii and it was pretty good i didnt realise that hard mode made you lose all your items so after dying later in the game i didnt continue playing     if you have played the wii version would you say this version is just as good if not better if its not as good ill just pick up the wii version again and play on normal mode
  t didnt understand the joke but pretends he did to save face
  kind of not really since its actually the best roguelike and every other roguelike is kind of not as good
        you guys are cute    i wanna see you kiss now
  t asshurt plebbitor mad hes getting the 4chan equivalent of a downvote
  heh nice try kid have a you
  but its a gamefaqs filename
  pucker up fuckboy
  i watched the first part of arino playing shiren but he sucks so bad it is a bit painful does he get better in part 2
  naw as amazing as it is its actually only on the border of really being a roguelike but thats one of the reasons its so good the real roguelike genre is pretty niche and unappealing to many gamers so ones reaction to shiren can indicate whether theyd like to delve deeper into them or go more for the roguelite genre of which there are tons now
  shiren is 100 a roguelike
  the fact is you can keep items in the warehouse though
  optional
  gta 5 is a rougelike because you can delete your save file every time you die
  the warehouse is intentionally optional for a true roguelike experience    not sure what your horrible gta 5 example is trying to prove
   its possible to play it like a traditional roguelike but it doesnt have true permadeath and you can basically brute force the game by making a 30 master sword and shield and gathering a huge accumulation of pots full of items that lets you breeze through the game     that doesnt make it bad genre distinctions arent value judgements but it is one of the things that puts in on the border or roguelikes and their close cousin genre roguelites/roguelikelikes     most of the other mystery dungeon games that chunsoft went on to make like chocobo pokemon etc are entirely roguelites
  not him but i get what he was saying you could force roguelike rules onto most games but that doesnt change the genre     either way you slice it shiren is a great game
  youre assuming the warehouse being optional was by accident why is the game perfectly tuned to be beaten with only items you find    have you ever thought about that or did you only beat the game with a 30 sword and shield
    you cant use the warehouse for like half the dungeons though including the hardest one
  it being a core part of the game changes the genre there are only a handful of core aspects that make something a roguelike permadeath is one of the big ones you can play final fantasy while ignoring the ability to save your game it doesnt make it any more of a roguelike    anyways this just goes to my original statement about how its a great starter game if you play it and ache for more then theres a whole genre of roguelikes out there     but if you liked the idea yet found it too hard or repetitive or something and just used the warehouse but still had fun then theres also a whole genre of roguelites to delve into     its a great middle game and starting off point       this is true too the extra dungeons are decent
    only jp only sfc games we talk about are popnvanias
  thats the fun part about him he sucks on pretty much every game they challenge him to play but with dedication a bit of luck and some help here and there he often manages to overcome his obstacles but perhaps you already did know that stuff some time has passed since ive watched that episode but iirc it was one of those cases that he beat the game even though the situation was desperate so yes he gets better in part 2
  ive just watched the first half of part 2 and youre right hes a lot better i wonder if he puts on a show being bad on purpose at times
  to me it looks genuine because he was like that since the very first season i could be wrong though then again what he plays outside of the stage is often something way easier
  shiren has dungeons where you cant bring anything in and lose everything when you die the jrpg part of it is just sort of like another game layered on the roguelike bones that are already there
  those are extra modes you unlock after beating the main game so it might be fair to say there are traditional roguelikes availible to you as bonus dungeons in the game but that is also the case for pokemon mystery dungeon     again thats not a bad thing about the game its a great game partially because it does appeal to both tastes its also important to note that roguelites arent a lesser type of game than roguelikes theyre just very different and usually people like one or the other rarely both equally
permadeath has nothing to do with whether a game is a roguelike or isnt its absurd for a game to change genre based on a small feature such as warehouses the core gameplay is the same as rogue tilebased turnbased rpg dungeon crawling  its not like you can add permadeath and random levels to mario and suddenly its a roguelike its still a platformer its a platformer whether you have one life or limited lives or infinite lives these are secondary elements  if you were to play a mod of nethack where the levels are the same every time and you can continue after death would that not still be a roguelike what if you were playing this mod without knowing it you would think that youre playing a roguelike and after you die the game would reveal that you werent playing a roguelike the whole time do you really believe in a definition where something like this is possible  i cant agree with a genre definition that groups shiren with games like spelunky spelunky risk of rain isaac etc play completely differently from rogueand each other but chunsofts games clearly operate under the same rules as rogue i dont mean to shit on these gamesi have hundreds of hours in each of the games ive mentioned but to me there is a clear divide between them and shiren
  permadeath has nothing to do with whether a game is a roguelike or isnt    its literally one of the key features im not even bothering to read the rest of your post but this has come up here before if youre interested in learning what a roguelike is then heres some reading otherwise dont waste all our time spewing random thoughts about things youre unaware of    
  dumbass dont respond if you wont read  berlin interpretation is garbage too used to determine how roguelike a game is what a joke oh how roguelike is dcss 90 how roguelike is bubble bobble 20
  lol this is the state of /vr
  imagine being this retarded
  why dont you enlighten a poor retard then how is permadeath a core feature if you can play the game for hours unaware of it until the game is over  i cant play through castlevania thinking its a platformer only for it to reveal itself to be a firstperson shooter i really dont get it a game doesnt change genre based on what happens when you lose
  its not like you can add permadeath and random levels to mario and suddenly its a roguelike  it would become your typical arcade platformer you idiot
  what are you arguing against
  i just saw the shittiest strawman ever and got triggered
  t redditor trying to fit in you didnt get the joke pal
  i dont know a whole lot about it  but this one though pretty damn great game
    the problem is this happens every couple of months where some idiot or the same one comes along complaining that they dont want to bother understanding why the deffinition is the way it is and why each aspect is important they just argue about what they think it should be and then demand everyone else bends over backwards to explain it while they disagree and argue about every little thing at this point if someone is too dumb to understand it on their own i just mock them sorry if this applies to you
  why bother responding if you wont engage in any way why waste your time and mine
  its funny to watch you double down on not wanting to learn yourself and then get mad youre not being spoonfed plus bumping the thread in case someone else comes along
i found it better to just never use the word roguelike again and just call everything roguelite
  better than not just learning the difference       neither spelunky risk of rain or isaac are traditional roguelikes at all by the way the first two are action platformers with some roguelike elements isaac is also an action game and was designed to be zelda dungeons with roguelike elements
  arguing over semantics is stupid literally no one cares but ultra spergs losers
  i wont bother to learn all the details for something i dont care that much  from what i could tell when looking it up for people to consider something to be a roguelike it has basically to be exactly like the handful of games that created the genre from the core mechanics to the graphics and every little fucking detail  in short nothing can be considered a roguelike because people enjoy being anal so i just call things roguelites to avoid entering a discussion that will go nowhere
    you guys are a hoot but its all good the genre requires thinking so it was never likely to appeal to you in the first place     ohh and roguelikes that fit the deffinition still get made quite often theres even a yearly contest challenge enjoyed by tons
  jrpg  requires thinking
  youre so close to understanding roguelikes and rpgs are very different genres despite having some similarities its a little like mistaking a beat em up for a fighting game because punching or thinking after burner is a flight sim because you fly a plane
roguelike fans are pure distilled ass cancer
  no hes an old man his natural reaction time sets him up to get destroyed by games outright and it takes some work and focus to get acclimated    source i have old man reflexes
i call rogue a dndlike and its a really shitty dndlike at thatin fact all dndlikes are shit especially nethack which cant even keep its genre straight
  do you have any reading comprehension i directly state that spelunky and the others play completely differently from rogue  so far youve entirely ignored my arguments and questions and instead just told me that your way of thinking is right again why reply to me its impossible to change anyones mind or learn anything if you just say im right and youre wrong what do you stand to gain from acting this way
  the only difference is in roguelikes you reset a million times until the first floor rolls a bunch of op equipment
shirens great love it
i never finished it like most rougelikes i usually end up getting pissed off and quit after a while i think ive only finished like 23 of them
  i want to beat this game so bad ive tried so many times but i always get my shit rocked when i get to the lava floors
  i directly state that spelunky and the others play completely differently from rogue    exactly which is why if you read the set of deffinitions and used your brain for even a moment you would be able to conclude theyre obviously not actually roguelikes which is what i was trying to explain so okay once more with feeling     a roguelike is a game like rogue if you look at the deffinition youll see that the high value elements are all the core elements of rogues gameplay its really hard easy to die and you only get once chance and no saves but its also turn based so you have time to consider each move before you make it and the options at your disposal are fairly complex so you have various ways to escape trouble then each time you play the dungeon and items are different so even though you could easily die hundreds times trying to win i sure did its always a fresh experience    those are considered the high value elements because they all work together to create a unique experience of a game generally the closer a game holds to those the more of a roguelike it is again not a value judgment just a description and even within those confines there have been a ton of games and will be loads more     but thats not to say its also not good to try some roguelike elements and toss them into another genre its how diablo came about after all       thats why skill is usually shown by wins in a row not solitary achievements like looping shmups i guess
  im not saying that spelunky is a roguelike what made you come to that conclusion im saying that shiren pmd and chunsofts other games are roguelikes unlike spelunky and those games  shiren plays just like rogue i dont see how just because there are warehouses it ceases to be a roguelike  to me the turnbased and gridbased nature are the core of the genre not permadeath and random levels sure these elements work extremely well in a roguelike but they arent a requirement  if you added crossplaythrough warehouses to angband it wouldnt be a roguelike by your definition how does such a small mechanic change a games genre youre doing the same things moving around on a grid fighting enemies picking up items and so on but you say its a different genre because of one secondary mechanic  why not draw the line somewhere else for example why not claim a game needs potions scrolls and wands to be a roguelike or that it needs an identification system to be a roguelike or that it needs a hunger clock these are all mechanics that work well in roguelikes and that most roguelikes have but would the lack of one of these mechanics disqualify a game for you  what features do you consider required for a roguelike the high value factors of the berlin interpretation in that case dcss wouldnt be a roguelike dcss has a separate menu for shops so it wouldnt be nonmodal the berlin interpretation is just an old list of roguelike tropes not a definition  a game cant be more of a roguelike whats more of a roguelike brogue or ivan a game is a roguelike or it isnt with very few games coming close to treading the line
  or that it needs an identification system to be a roguelike  i wish this was more common in roguelites honestly trying to figure out what the fuck youre hauling around without getting yourself killed is the most interesting part of these games
  i dont see how just because there are warehouses it ceases to be a roguelike    i never said it wasnt a roguelike in fact i specifically said it is considered a roguelike but it does have a few features that put it on the border like the various progression systems built into it and remember i mentioned that as a good thing     is shiren a roguelike deffinitely is it 100 roguelike as one poster said not quite because the main game has progress that carries between playthroughs and if you actually read the description in the link i posted you would understand that but as i already said you have no interest in trying to understand just argue like this    to me the turnbased and gridbased nature are the core of the genre not permadeath and random levels     im not here to argue with you because you want the deffinition to be different if you dont like it because you still cant understand why it is the way it is i dont care this is why i dont waste my time and just make fun of you now
  whats more of a roguelike brogue or ivan     all three are in the genre but brogue and ivan are more of a roguelike than shiren and shiren in turn is more of a roguelike than pokemon mystery dungeon i would say get it now because its so simple but i know you dont and this will probably just end up confusing you more lol
  what does it mean to be more of a roguelike just having more berlin interpretation factors  how many more factors does pmd need to be a roguelike
  imagine being this retarded x2  inform yourself before spewing your flawed opinions this way youll earn time and credibility
  ah yes once i fully agree with you then youll tell me all about how right we both are
  the ironing
  yes the more of the core elements key to the genre a game has the closer is is to being a real roguelike why is this taking you so long     as for pmd i dont care enough to lay it all out in detail for you watch gameplay videos of it and try actually using your brain for once
  binding of isaac is zelda    fuck off no it fucking isnt
  but bro i love strafing around and shooting hordes of enemies in zelda and the worldmap in isaac is totally rad too
  i ask how many factors to show you how flawed the berlin interpretation is how many roguelike points does something need to be a roguelike  according to your roguelike points system isaac is more of a roguelke than pmd a realtime twinstick shooter is more of a roguelike than a turnbased gridbased rpg
  this game is really good why is it never talked about here    because we need more xenogears sotn castlevania iv and ff7 threads  we dont have enough of those
  neither binding of isaac or pmd are traditional roguelikes at all i dont know why you cant grasp this but i feel bad for you        i cant say how successful he was boi has never interested me but the guy who made it set out to make a riguelike inspired zelda dungeon crawl game
  pmd is a roguelike the central mechanics are the same as rogue yet apparently its less of a roguelike than an action game  why dont you tell me how many factors a game needs to be a roguelike whats the difference between a major factor and a minor factor
  i already made the mistake of trying to explain it to you and you proved yourself completely unable to to understand you said it yourself why should i continue to waste my time on someone like you
  when did you explain anything to me all youve done is tell me that i know nothing and post information from the berlin interpretation which ive already read and think is horseshit you havent elaborated further or answered any of my questions  you cant answer my question of how many factors because your way of thinking is so deeply flawed
  here   and yes the berlin interpretation lays out really well what the core elements of a roguelike are because that was the whole point of the conference the lead creators of this genre all had a long discussion and distilled what the key features that make a game a roguelike are    but you being a stupid impetuous child assumed initally that a roguelike is probably just an rpg with some random bullshit and refuse to ever think or learn beyond that     you can also listen to roguelike radio who did an excellent episode on what roguelikes are but its the same thing and so would probably just confuse you     lol
i like all the chunsoft roguelikes that are translated d ive probably played powder the most though on psp
rate the five sonic games for genesis/md  3knuksknuks213  stand alone no lock on sonic 3 is trash
s3k  s2  sk  s3  s1  spinball  3d
  23k3k1
  includes spinball  based
213kk3spinball3d
s3k  s2  s1  scd  spinball  3d  mania beats all of them
  i played cd years ago and just didnt get it fill me in on this one cause i never went back to it should i
s3  s2  s3k  s1  sk
  sonic 3 is best  only has 6 zones carnival zone sucks that stupid drum where for the first last and only time in the whole series you have to stand still and press up to make it move final boss fight is a disgraceful rushed joke music is sub par compared to 2 or k two player split screen is shit  better than sonic 2  11 zones all great except aquatic ruin no broken mechanics arguably best music in series casino night so good they made a whole game of it spinball two player split is good but needs more levels maybe when sonic 3 comes out we can split screen the whole game epic final boss most iconic in the series  with alldo respect please explain
  3k23
  3k 2 1 spinball 3d    theres no point in ranking sonic 3 and sonic  knuckles independently theyre two halves of one game
  two halves of one game  exactly dont settle for half
  theres no point in ranking sonic 3 and sonic  knuckles independently theyre two halves of one game  i understand where your coming from but they were sold separately and if you were like me you only had onesk for a few years before picking up the other imo its fair game to rank them both ways
  all great except aquatic ruin  metropolis  mystic cave  and fuck you aquatic ruin is good
  really i just recently played cd and actually had fun with it the only other sonics i played were the gba ones and 1 which were all pretty meh imo    gotta admit half the reason is the amazing ost cd has though
  so damn good    
  stand alone no lock on sonic 3 is trash    this is not true at all the games were meant to be joined together so when ranking them its always best to rank them combined as intended in the first place with that said    3k  2  1  spinball  3d    i played the saturn version of 3d but that game isnt really any different from the genesis one and it is absolute pitiful garbage spinball is pretty good although very hard and it should have played a lot better the framerate for it isnt good and the physics arent the best either which takes it down a lot there really isnt much to say about the main games that hasnt already been said
  id put base s3 over base sk but otherwise this list is spoton
  11 zones all great except aquatic ruin    no the final zone is the shit zone in that game aquatic ruin is good in fact id say the final bosses in 2 are shitty as well sonic 2 is great but finishes off badly so it sours a bit an otherwise excellent game
not a single list putting 1 above 2  hurts to read
   cave  i would say mystic cave gets a pass for the stage music alone        spinball is pretty good although very hard and it should have played a lot better  this i like spinball probably more than i should but it really could of been great instead of just being okay in an alternate universe they released a sequel on the saturn that fixed all the issues from the first one
  imo the 2 games are sold seperately are totally beatable i sepwndantly and as such were intended to be played that way as well the whole lock on thing was a gimmick to sell more games even though they were developed at the same time they were designed and developed as 2 seperate games    your logic would imply that entire pokemon gens should be considdered one and rated together only after beating them all or even the zelda oracles games being considderrd and rated as one game or hell even alternate versions of street fighter 2 its just silly  so honestly there is nothing wrong with ranking these 2 seperate sonic games and the locked on version seperately if you only play sonic 3 and knuckles thats your deal bro      no love for sonic 2 and knuckles    also    sonic 2sonic the hedgehogsonic 2 and knucklessonic and knucklessonic 3 and knucklessonic 3 spinball blast
  totally beatable independantly
so i just bought a genesis and the first 4 sonic games heres my rating after 100 completing all of them     s3k  sonic 2  sk  3  sonic 1     for the bonus after that rating all the way on the fucking bottom comes     sonic cd sonic spinballsonic 3d blast
  sonic 3  knuckles  sonic 2  sonic 1  sonic 3d blast  sonic cd
  its a piece of shit the only reason it got a pass was because it was the only sonic game on megacd and people trying to justify that cancer addon
  compare any zone from 2 with any zone from standalone 3 except angel island the first level and the only reason anyone defends it and 2 wins every time is 2 perfect no is there any aspect of stand alone 3 sans zone 1 that is comparable to 2 no   3 is half a game 2 is a whole game 1 is a whole game kucks could pass for a whole game 3kuncks is top shelf
  megacd and people trying to justify that cancer addon  hot take the sega cd was a good addon but needed more time/support
  all great except aquatic ruin  fuck   you
      swimming doesnt belong in sonic so aquatic ruin sucks but its infinitely better than carnival night
  you suck
  it didnt solve the color limitation wasted opportunity considering its library its a crap addon in retrospect  back then it was promising ill admit
  literally the only good thing about sonic games is the music and the first level of the main games
sonic 3  s3k  sonic 2  sonic  knuckles  sonic 1  sonic 3d blast  sonic spinball  dr robotniks mean bean machine     i dont care for the zones in sonic  knuckles you cant say sonic 3 is trash and then put s3k as your top pick      are you conceding that the opening half of the game is shit do you even like sonic all in all fuck you
  i love that grungy metallic music
s3k  s2  s1  spinball  3d    never played cd so i cant speak on it
  if you order a sandwich you expect meat and bread and possibly cheese if you order one and just get bread its a bad sandwich thats the point
  sonic 3 is the bread     sonic 3 is the american cheese melting on the bread     sonic  knuckles is the pickle     you are the turkey
sonic 3  1  2   knuckles
literal shit  any sonic game
3k2s2ks1blue spheresmbmspinball3d  the only good thing 3d was a based soundtrack    3 had a great soundtrack feeling like mj music some of my favorites stages are from that half like hydrocity hydro city marble garden carnival night ice capmore act2 and launch base        the joke final boss isnt even a final boss since 3k is 1 game divided in parts that joke final boss is the only boss that can damage super form  carnival night is good one of the best levels in terms of alternative paths and secret routes the never using up excuse is stupid and falsean example your beloved sonic 2 and tornado section when you jump on the barrel that thing will bounce up and down in fact there are other barrels that appear before that one with that movement to indicate that idea
   metropolis zone is good
patrician sonic ranking coming through  sonic 1sonic 2sonic  knucklessonic 3
  2  3k  3  k  1
   patrician   doesnt rank sonic 3 and knuckles
  exactly
  this comment almost makes up for ranking 3 last
  2cd3k1chaotix    3k is already kinda lengthy but has too many meh zones carnival marble sandopolis
  because it is not a game in and of itself sonic  knuckles is the game with the lockon feature sonic 3  knuckles is merely a feature of sk
  the game sonic 3 was originally planned to be a single product containing the levels from the released sonic 3 as well as the sonic and knuckles cart but sega told yuji naka that it would be too expensive and take too long so he was forced to split it this is pretty common knowledge but you can verify it by looking at the level select in sonic 3 which lists some levels from sonic and knuckles
  thats fine and we all know that  the games were still released separately  if you were alive back in the day and you got the games as they were released youd count them as separate
objectively    s2  s3k  sk  s3  s1    anyone ranking s1 higher has forgotten how excruciating these games are without spindash
  i had to pay for each one separately therefore they are two games i remember when sonic 3 came out i was so excited b/c of how awesome sonic 2 was i was so disappointed when the competitive mode was downgraded my brothers and i played that on 2 nonstop and the game was so short with such an abrupt ending i knew something wasnt right then when sk came out it all made sense then it should have been released as all one game but it wasnt at least we got the lock on feature so we could play it as intended assuming carnival night isnt just a rushed rehash of casino and launch zone isnt just a rushed rehash of oil ocean come to think angel island and marble hill are really all that seem fleshed out in sonic 3 maybe if it was all one game the filler levels wouldnt have been there or maybe theyre not filler cheap knock offs and just rushed due to time constraints the sonicknuckles jingles that override the sonic 3 jingles during lock on are so much better than that mjinspired crap music as well i wonder how different these two sonic 3 and sk would be if they had been developed as one game not two without the time constraints would some of those zones not exist would they be in a different order would the spinning drum been fixed would sandopolis have made the cut would sky sanctuary be more fleshed out would there still have been over a dozen emeralds really makes you wonder
  its like if there was a mario without the run button thats how crippling it is
  sonic 1 is the patrician choice though  you dont need spindash when youre good
  s3k  sonic 1  sonic  knuckles  sonic 2  sonic 3  sonic cd
  sandopolis  i know im in the minority but ive always liked sandopolis zone yes even act 2
i remember playing a game where the main character was a built blue guy with nothing but a harness for clothing i think he also had a harness around his face as well     i believe it was an adventure game where you could talk to creatures in the world and take a soft neutral and harsh stance with them     the game was released in the mid90s and sort of looked like a less ugly bioforge from what i remember     i would be super happy if anyone told me what this game was because i have been searching for a very long time
i think i remember the main character interacting with an injured winged creature in a cave this is the scene from which i remember the dialogue option
little big adventure 2 
  i wonder if jannie will notice this
  is it perfect assassin        the bluedude in it looks very blue and has some sort a head harness
bump i also really want to know the answer
  its totally perfect assassin like i said in  even the video on youtube seems to indicate so  but the op is so callous he cant even reply to his own thread even in 10 hours after he was given his answer
  obviously correct i wish op was here i hope he sees this bastid
  the game does look interesting at least as is dreams to reality that i found while searching for the game  some other interesting games i bumped into while on search  dark earth  the creed  rome pathway to power
does all stars have the definitive versions of 13 and world
they screwed up 1 otherwise its fine
definitive version
  nah maybe 2 but the others all have worse art style and music and the block physics are fucked in 1 theres a rom hack that fixes this though
  people say that the jumps are different
broken physics  worse music  uglier cluttered graphics
  now thats just being a nit picking autist
who gives a fuck just play the damn games
  not how the developers intended
    cluttered  soulless   generic  nesfags are fucking delusional kek
  i agree with all of these except that the underworld levels of smb1 are clearly some sort of stone/brick walled dungeon or cave and not meant to represent the interior of a pipe
  this all stars was the shit yo
  i feel like the lego blocks really fit the weird dream world aesthetic
  aesthetic nitpicks aside the characters of smas pop just fine against the backgrounds and are defined perfectly well no idea what the hell youre complaining about that for    generic and soulless are pretty arbitrary and lame complaints too has it occurred to you that the mario style cloud in smb3 could be considered a lazy recycle by a dev who dont give a shit    i agree the lego blocks are a total mystery but its subcon an actual dream world
smb all stars plus world is a great package and only delusional grandpas will argue otherwise there are some what different jump physics but shit like janky hitboxes in 1 are fixed the save system on each game is also a plus
i dont mind the graphics of the remade 1 and lost levels however the jump bug ruins those games though there is a patch that fixes that i prefer the original 2 and 3 over the all stars versions both music and graphics wise i like the new luigi sprites in all stars
  i enjoyed all stars a lot when i was a kid i dont have a problem with it but most of the criticism in the thread is on point      its probably nitpicking autists that made the super mario brothers games so good in the first place the problem is more the cherrypicking the brown caves are objectively lazy from a theming perspective compared to the nes version the airships have the same problem where each one has a color in the nes version but in the smas version they are all just brown wood but the game as a whole isnt as bad as that there are plenty of shots you could take to make the smas version look better
  the osts sound like shit  mario isnt wearing red and black on mario 3
   text says one thing and pics says another  what is anon trying to convey
  smb1 was kind of screwed up and i never liked how it looked in all stars  smb2 is just fine  sma4 is the best version of mario 3  world is slightly better in all stars  world
  i prefer the colors of the snes version but its weaker otherwise          blah blah muh autism  its honestly weird to me that anybody would prefer the remakess graphics theyre not the worst theyre not even really bad mostly but the games nailed it the first time around and the stuff that looks totally different is not an improvement    now the kirbys adventure remake image that thing is autism anybody have it handy
the all stars versions are all better than the nes 
  thats cool and all but right is better
  i think the version of world in all stars is missing a background layer so wavy water effects do not work
  bullshit shut up
  only like one level had that wavy effect so its not like anything major  the one with the torpedo teds i think
  yes    ignore 
  absolutely not quite the opposite
  definitive versions of the nes games definitely not 1 but 3 works fine the save feature is a nice addition too      youre just being a bitch
   isnt wearing red and black on mario 3  that was one of the few actual improvements
  the only one i agree with is the first with the mario 3 caves you could just as well say the originals lacked detail or depth and looked more like space than a cave especially with the moonesque unfitting ice tiles in the first example the bigger clouds in mario 3 help separate the lower main part of the level and the upper part and make the background feel more layered instead of just a bunch of cyan like the original the 12 criticism is just retarded its obviously meant to be a general underground area you only travel there through a pipe
just fuck my shit up
  im ok with smb1 but the rest can fuck off
      did the allstars artists us mspaint
  they both look fine
  why is the sky purple in smb1
  what am i supposed to be noticing here other than that mario 1 allstars makes nes 13 look ugly as shit lel
  same shit happens when we discuss kirbys adventure or majoras mask these people are cancer simply having a pic related doesnt make your point more right 
     wow i think youre right all stars looks like dos shovelware      anyone up for a game of skunny
bluepilled allstars versions look better    neutralpilled originals look better    redpilled both look like shit  retro mario games almost universally look awful
  t sunshine/galaxy/odyssey babby
  all the years i felt something was off with the smb3as mario sprite but could never put my finger on it and it just so happens to be his fingers and hands
  no backdrop shadows on sm3 platforms   wew what a shitfest never played it but wow nintendo is 1000 better when limited most artists are but heres the proof
  the plants in all stars say sex if you turn your head 90 degrees
  that wouldve looked awful with the deeper background elements
  dude i dont care that they had to compromise on aesthetics because they already fucked up the aesthetics too much do you understand how mindless you are
  apparently not having blaring cyan absolutely everywhere is fucking up muh aesthetic how mindless of me
  smas is betterlooking and the gameplay difference in sm1 is inconsequential for regular players who will be playing sm3 ten times as much anyway if theyre unretarded so just ignore them
  smas is betterlooking  youre a fucking retard
  it is lol especially in regard to smb1 the nes version looks incredibly amateurish just look at that 13 comparison that other anon posted the detail on the platforms is literally just a black squiggle meanwhile everyone itt is crying at smas for having the gall to add some depth and texture to things
  those are quite obviously nintendos own nb blocks
  jfc opinion invalidated three or four times in one sentence
  ajajajajajaja panocha
  one of the levels in super mario land 2 is completely made up of those blocks even having the nb logo in a couple spots
are the fairies in the zelda 64 games really just balls with wings or did they just not bother drawing them with a humanoid shape because the model was too small
  yes
  oh yeah
    as you said it was probably done both because of technical limitations and because its visually much easier for the player to follow a ball over a small humanoid shape i dont think the fairies are meant to be balls with wings but i dont know that for a fact
i cant remember if it was for oot or from the beginning of the series but didnt miyamoto want to base the fairies off tinkerbell
the ball is light since fairies glow
wind waker is the only 3d zelda to have a humanoid fairy model
fun fact in a japanese interview eiji aonuma said that the stray fairies from majoras mask were supposed to be the model for all fairies in ocarina of time but shigeru miyamoto stopped him and they used the assets in their next game
  hyrule warriors defintive edition also does
  pitpat is mai waifu
  even as far back as oot he was intent on ruining the series damn
  who aonuma or miyamoto if youre fucking trashing aonuma i will grab you by the throat
  an early piece of ocarina artwork shows a fully humanoid fairy so its likely that the spherical shape is for two reasons the first is obviously that its a lot easier to depict a ball with wings the second is that navi is both a character and a gameplay function so having her be as unobtrusive as possible is necessary imagine having a sprite of an actual fairy flying around highlighting points of interest for you with the 64s limited capabilities itd look awkward like the majoras mask stray fairies
  you can depict a human shape with limited resources it wasnt unlike n64 devs to use flat sprites for 3d objects it was probably more of a visibility thing
  thats what i was saying the ball looked better i just also think a humanoid fairy sprite wouldve looked a lot worse
  the fairies had humanoid bodies going as far back as the first game the switch in oot was just for style it would have been no more resource intensive to have a 2d humanoid sprite vs the 2d ball sprite unless they wanted to have a ton of animations/emotes for it in the end someone decided that a detailed sprite was too distracting for something that would spend a lot of time on camera and its main function was flying away to highlight stuff anyways so a color changing dot was much more useful     given how navi and more so tatl actually move and talk to link with some pretty good expression id like to see them get an actual face to emote with one day you could probably get a beloved fairy companion into a zelda game for once by basically stealing and inserting puck from berserk into one actually puck is probably part of the inspiration for the fairies in oot and mm at all
all dressed up with nowhere to go
  walking with a dead man over my shoulder
  they are humanoid but completely naked and cannot be show on a children game
  what the fuck in this post tripped my filter
  they managed to properly illustrate sparx who performed a similar function in the spyro series but then again he wasnt starring in one of the dullest franchises of all time seriously each episode following the boy adventurer and his pals from hyrule as they fight assorted villains has been indistinguishable from the others aside from the cartoonish imagery the series only consistency has been its lack of excitement and ineffective use of repetitive puzzles all to make magic unmagical to make action seem inert  perhaps the die was cast when nintendo vetoed the idea of a third party producing the games miyanoto made sure the series would never be mistaken for a work of art that meant anything to anybody just ridiculously profitable crosspromotion for their annual party games the zelda series might be antisony or not but its certainly the antispyro series in its refusal of wonder beauty and excitement    aat least the platforming elements were good though    no     the writing is dreadful the exploration was nonexistent as i played i noticed that every time link went to explore a largely empty world nintendo shoehorned in some repetitive puzzles to pad out the game i began marking on the back of a nintendo power magazine every time i came to the same rehashed box pushing/lever pulling puzzles i stopped only after i had marked the envelope several dozen times i was incredulous nintendos team is so governed by cliches and milking tired franchises ad nauseum that they have no other style of development later i watched a lavish loving lets play of the ocarina of time by some youtube manchild he said something to the effect of if these kids are playing ocarina of time at 11 or 12 then when they get older they will go on to owning a nintendo switch and he was quite right he was not being ironic when you play the ocarina of time you are in fact trained to play the same dull nintendo rehashes decade after decade
  ah what a wonderful post thank you my fellow sonybro
  i appreciate when this copypasta actually has work put into it instead of some memer just changing the introduction you can always tell theyre not nearly as smart as the person who wrote the original copypasta because its so weak compared to the rest of it but this copypasta was written by someone with an actual sense of humor
  you should make a tier list similar to this  it would be perfect
  and cannot be show on a children game    merican puritanism
  spyro  playstation sucks its only function was to sap the pc games market for 10 years
  was the original metroid i bet it was metroid
  you say that like it was a bad thing the humanlooking fairies that showed up in all zelda medium prior to oot looked retarded
  because tits movies are worse than the have ever been in history and tv is just as bad but edgier im gunna tell you something else video games now are just reskins of previous games for the most part red dead 2 is grand theft horses
  can americans even write
  yes its lazy but everyone knows its true so is copy pasta
    both  everyone knows koizumi was the one behind the golden age of zelda
    navi is literally a flat object in the game what the hell are you talking about
  i wouldnt say so in terms of films id say that european film companies are much more comfortable with for example depicting nudity in a nonsexual manner or objectively depicting prostitution and drug abuse
  are the fairies in the zelda 64 games really just balls with wings or did they just not bother drawing them with a humanoid shape because the model was too small    you clearly have never played zelda oot op
when i was a kid i had a thing for that fairy girl from that dic zelda cartoon that aired with the super mario bros super show
  well achtually navi is made up of 3 different 2 dimensional planes her body is on one with two others used for each wing individually each plane is at an angle to each other making the entire object 3 dimensional by definition
  thats exactly why the question you idiot because the great fairy is a big woman so it makes you wonder if the fairies are supposed to be people too and they just look like balls because the ball is meant to represent them glowing
the balls are inert
    in other words you dont have a question youre just pointing out something extremely obvious and calling people idiots for not praising your observational insights
    she qt
  does that mean they dont work
  no you moron
  woah hold the phone is that brown dude on the left a maskless sheik  sheik confirmed man
  maybe if you judge by hollywood which maintains maximum profits by pandering to the lowest common denominator    there are a lot of edgy independent film producers in the us
  hardly anything in this game part of the dullest series of all time works seriously each adventure following the assorted pals makes action inert    bbut    no    the puzzles were repetitive and i was incredulous im not being ironic
  i believe its impa
  what because of the white hair  everything about that character is sheik except the hair color and lack of a mask  also that looks entirely like a man id even believe it was a cut character before impa
  lets say it is sheik i still dont see how it is a man the face is quite feminine
  walkin the streets all alone
  i always figured that they were humanoid but glowed so brightly they appeared as balls of light
  okay this one was lame
  its really not especially for oots artstyle  besides sheik is a man is pretty well confirmed hell they even changed his voice
  thanks for coming in today
  zelda 1 and 2 did but the shitty 8 bit limitation kept it from being realistic
  what a terrible mascot
  hyrule warriors is hardly a zelda title
the fairies in the 64 games do indeed seem to be little more than balls of light with wings just look at how the wings are positioned and taper relative to the body they seem to connect to the ball and not to some smaller entity shrouded by a glowing energy field    the fairies had humanoid bodies going as far back as the first game  true but to be fair they changed some other established stuff somewhat randomly in oot like octoroks becoming sea creatures and zoras transforming from aggressive fire  spitting seabeasts into graceful sea people
  no
  what exactly about this image confirms sheik is a man
  read it again anon closely
  game boy zeldas have a vaguely humain shape
      sheik is zelda disguised as a man still pretty feminine though but whether or not she used magic to actually genderbend im not sure if that was confirmed
  well yeah everyone knows that  to be honest different iterationz of sheik look to flipflop on that oot sheik looks like a man for sure but hyrule warriors sheik was very obviously just zelda smash u sheik seems to be a dude though some people have even said that particular sheik might just be botw link and not zelda at all since link looks just like that if you wear sheiks mask with the sheikah set but that seems like a stretch
    this discussion is older than time itself but i want to know is whether people like to draw art of unclothed sheik as a man dick and all for research
  crime and punishment shakes me to my core
  im sure thats easy to find
  octoroks were always supposed to be octopus like things that spit rocks so becoming sea creatures makes sense but the truth is that nintendo did and really still does to this day change things on a whim they come up with a new idea for their games and will remake something that they already have to fit it they just dont really care to much about giving their games a hard canon or story line which is why we have this thread because that attitude still doesnt stop autists from trying to make one
  what a happy fairy
  you will never be stabbed by those boobs  why even live
  actually puck is probably part of the inspiration for the fairies in oot and mm at all  thats a huge stretch      yikes      youre say thing about a japanese game you do know in japan nudity is censored right its been that way since the tokugawa shogunate japanese people also culturally object to intimate displays of affection which is why you never see characters in romantic anime ever progress pass a hug or kiss no tongue      so you are admitting then that the quality of entertainment has very little to do with censorship good
  japanese people also culturally object to intimate displays of affection which is why you never see characters in romantic anime ever progress pass a hug or kiss no tongue  this is an absolute bullshit claim and shows just how little you know of what youre talking about
  naked fairies are cute
  looks like wilma flintstone
  koizumi was the one behind the golden age of zelda  ah yes the genius behind dk jungle beat and flipnote studio who didnt work on any zelda games as a programmer or designer is behind the series golden age because of his art and character concepts   ok
  there is an obscene amount of erotic fanfiction featuring shieks dick if thats your jam
  you trying to imply jungle beat is a bad game buddy
  the debate about this is pretty silly since we have all the facts and they arent hard to understand zelda doesnt change any part of her biology sheik is just a disguise if she had changed sex there wouldnt be any need to wrap her breasts which shes clearly done even though zelda is a biological female sheik is intended to be a male persona and is always referred to in game as he and a man autists who try to claim sheik is a girl because the person playing sheik is a girl are missing the point completely for all intents and purposes sheik is a male a male persona not a biological male     actually this thread is surprisingly rational and civil by /vr/ standards im amazed the average intelligence level here is high enough that most people realize zelda fairies are in fact intended to be small humanoids and not just disembodied balls of light
  thats a huge stretch  berserk started in what 1989 so theres like 9 years for someone to read at least the first few chapters and get the idea though puck only became a character after the first arc so probably not really if you want to point at anything the inspiration should be tinkerbell
    koizumi did contribute a lot of what people like in the series he was adding lore when miyamoto said the gameplay was more important he was a programmer including the ztargeting in ocarina and a designer of 2d art and 3d models he wrote or cowrote the stories of a link to the past links awakening ocarina and majoras mask and probably more  and thats not even including all he did for mario      surprisingly rational and civil by /vr/ standards  well im just passing through from other boards
  theyre too bright to see so all you see is the light they radiate
  that makes sense
  tfw read 4 of them  still hate reading
   literatly just puck    glad they used the orbs
  if she was this hot i think the number of people complaining about her would have dropped sharply
  well theres no cure for plebness
  kill yourself faggotleaf
  just stop
  shut up
  gotta love when it replies without its name as if anyone else is really going to stand up for this waste of space
  what are you actually on about you realize that person is not talking to her you paranoid fuck
    i got you piccolos a wise man
  yeah
  t schizo
  says windwaker is the only 3d zelda with humanoid faries  mentions 2d gameboy games  please learn to fucking read
    shit this is what i get for attempting to post at 5am with less than 3 hours of sleep under my belt
  thats karma baby
  tee hee
  tee hee  not aaaaaaahh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
  pretty sure the wraps are designed to keep the otherwise loose eye of truth decoration in place chest binding doesnt magically give you big masculine pushup pecs and shoulders and any time sheik reverts to zelda on screen its with triforce magic sheik is also brown with red eyes you cant say theres no biological change sheik even has a protrudent brow ridge which is a distinctly male feature not present on zelda
    he really loves zelda   
the fairys look the way they do because the primary inspiration to the legend of zelda is the movie legend 1985
  ive been meaning to see that movie yes i know it wasnt very well received but i dont particularly care i had no idea it inspired zelda thats really interesting    im noticing more and more that nintendo really seemed to have a fondness for ridley scott what with basically everything in metroid referencing alien and star fox referencing blade runner i always find it cool when japan takes direct inspiration from western stuff instead of just kinda ignoring it
  i love the movie but ive only ever seen the european release version of it which differs wildly from the us theatrical release albeit being closer to the directors original vision i assume however its one of those deals where people often strongly prefer the version they see first theres 3 distinct versions  us theatrical  european release  directors cut  us version has a score by the band tangerine dream which the producers put in for some reason the film was originally supposed to have a clasical score by jerry goldsmith which the european release retains which is the version i grew up with and prefer i think the directors cut also has the goldsmith score    
      i think its a solid movie its more spooky and atmospheric than a standard fantasy style kind of a black sheep in ridley scotts career but it has tim curry chewing scenery as much as you would hope  even though i saw it in a time when i was disinterested in video games i still thought it was very zeldalike so its not surprising if it is an influence the zelda series has a mostly european/medieval style with only a bit of japanese mythology in there at least thats the impression i get from them
  fairy porn
  not gonna lie but when i was a kid when i first saw this fairy i suddenly got a boner
  im a little bummed out when i first learned theyre not little puffball spirits i wish every 3d zelda used them
  the zelda series has a mostly european/medieval style with only a bit of japanese mythology in there at least thats the impression i get from them    thats how it started off the nes zeldas had a lot of crosses in the graveyards and links outfit seemed inspired by robin hoods lincoln green clothes hell link had a crusaders cross on his shield
  lincoln green  is this the true reason behind links name
  no links full name is actually link oln park because his parents were really huge fans
  i just realized the fairy isnt crying its just a little wand
  i thought she was creepy i still remember a dream i had when i was about 5 years old where a woman flashed her tits at me and i got a boner i didnt know what flashing was or what tits looked like i dont know how my 5 year old brain came up with that imagery
  ah hes korean
    just realized from looking at this picture that sheiks skin tone is completely different from zeldas so even for people who insist sheik is a girl theres no denying that zelda can use magic to completely change her appearance which lends more credence to the she can also just turn herself into a man camp and side note being able to give yourself a dick with magic is an amazing power
  another thing sheik and zelda consistently share a voice actress when they both appear    in ssb when you vertically ko sheik he gives a really high pitched scream    i know this debate has gone on for 20 years but it will go on forever
  your part about oots quality is accurate as fuck i played it immediately when it came out after playing similar games before it like mystical ninja and quest and it was/is indeed dull as fuck majoras mask fixed a lot of its issues and is contrariwise still an amazing game unlike any other zelda game of aonumas sadly
  fuck you it is a zelda title in everything but canon to not screw up future stories
  how to tell someone is underage and doesnt know what its like to play a game in 240p on a 20inchscreen via composite signal  there would have been no point you wouldnt have been able to make anything out
  and how old are you
  32yearold boomer
  thats not even that old dude
fucked up how a goblet is a cup and not a tiny goblin
  she also gave me funny feelings as a young kid
  this is legit one of the worst takes ive ever seen you call ocarina dull and spyro is your example of what it should aspire to spyro
  i dont think he actually believes it it seems to be a meme and memes tend to involve representing good things as bad and bad things as good for example there are lots of memes saying donald trump is smart which as we all know is false
  there are also lots of memes claiming that traps arent real women and that its gay if you want to suck and fuck them which we all know is also false
  indeed very good example
  this guy know what hes talking about
  yeah spyro is a quality immersive 3d game with unique puzzles and a populated overworld that imparts a sense of exploration          why did so many sega and nintendo fans grow up being weird sexual deviants
  why are sonic fans into weird shit    gee you tell me
  sheik has a deep voice in ssbu  but voice pitch in videogames hardly has any bearing on gender i would take that as a nice little detail that connects zelda to sheik i still think sheik is a man no amount of mental gymnastics can make        read as thats just zelda in a different outfit her body is still the same
ill just leave this here    
    and on the very same website    every pronoun is her you just cant trust sakurai someone who worked on ocarina must know the answer
      it is entirely possible that the sheik in ssbu is meant to be a different person from the sheik in the other ssb games and thats why the pronouns changed but ssb is very minimalist with its lore so thats yet another thing we can only speculate on additionally i am aware that the japanese language does not necessarily use gendered pronouns so i dont know what the japanese description says but it is also possible that the translator may have taken liberties    i can usually tell in movies and games and such when a womans voice is being disguised to sound like a mans but it would be interesting to know whether they actually gave sheik a male voice actor in ssbu unfortunately as far as i can tell the voice actor does not seem to be known but thats also interesting because sheik has previously had the same voice actor since melee so there are some implications to having changed that
  brawl    outdated info  smash is barely relevant anyway i was just pointing out that they seem to have changed their stance
  i wouldnt be surprised sheik clearly has a different va in ssbu voice sounds much deeper might even be links va by the sound of his grunts
how this thread went from talking about fairies to shrek dick
  yeah i think that sheik was supposed to be links sidekick in his journey or something but since oot is a clusterfuck in development they just pasted sheik into zelda thing they were never the same in development
  how did a thread discussing zelda branch off into more zelda discussion  gee a mystery for the ages
  japanese language does not necessarily use gendered pronouns  huh fair enough    no one should take ssb as any franchises canon its just more to speculate on since he/she doesnt pop up that much
  this interesting tidbit was found in the files for majoras mask 3d
  that would be strange for ganondorf since his face was on the moon
  they werent where did you hear that
  itd be cool to see their terminian counterparts just relaxing and fishing though i wonder what their dialogue might have been
  id like to find sheiks tidbits if you know what i mean
  i have some theories about zelda    i actually have proofs of some stuff like the shadow temple actually having parts of the wind temple and the wind temple becoming the forest temple    the wind is the true nature of lost woods but that concept was lost but that came back in breath of the wild    the temple of light being remade into the temple of time    i think that half of the spirit temple the light puzzles were part of the light temple    zelda went through three directors a lot was lost and remixed specially when miyamoto step in and demanded for link to be a child    i think that the rito race was supposed to be the wind sage with rauru
  i meant with kaepora gaebora
  miyamoto and to some extent aunuma need to stay away from zelda and let koizumi do what he does
  mascot shes just one of the fairies you can get in hw
  yes    miyamoto needs to retire
  mystical ninja    now that was a game  da da dash
  implying 64 faeries werent narcissistic little shits and thats why they would rather glow too brightly to have their humanoid bodies seen  theres a reason people get pissed at them
  funny thing is after the two of them worked on the n64 zeldas together koizumi took over the mario show  
  i dont know what miyamoto even does anymore he hasnt felt like he has genuinely had any influence on nintendo in multiple decades
  hes in a handsoff position just like executive producers of movies or like stan lee was for all of marvel  supervising director of star fox zero  that sounds like the closest hes been involved in years
  i just miss surreal fever dream zelda with horror elements
  and destroying 3ds paper mario
  its odd to think how frightening koji kondos music used to be and then to compare it to the music he does now the guys musical range is impressive
  that sheik and oot art has manly pecs and physique but some others like this  the most recent one are much more feminine i guess even the staff cant decide
  the hunch is throwing you off mate this is not feminine    brawl and hyrule warriors had pretty feminine sheiks though but the only sheik that matters is oot/fishingman2
  im not ruling out that she actually transforms into a man maybe in some continuities shes all lady under there but some are genderbent you know japanese media and their girly men but even in that ultimate pic she clearly has a female body    if she had changed sex there wouldnt be any need to wrap her breasts which shes clearly done  it seems like the level of androgyny keeps changing over time to throw everyone off
    just had an idea  ultimate sheik is link in the sheik costume  link uses magic to transform into a woman    is this more hot or less hot than zelda using magic to transform into a man
  zelda turns into crossdressing link on a dime  its magic i aint gotta explain shit
  i agree regarding brawl and hyrule warriors    smash 4 was a bit more androgynous and i have to disagree when it comes to smash u especially with the changed voice and nintendo referring to him/her as a man just looks like a muscular chest in ultimate wrapping isnt exactly confirmation of anything and for the record yes men wear those wraps too    worth noting that hyrule warriors cast are completely new characters and thats an entirely different sheik
  links not crossdressing though even if sheik was just zelda in a change of clothes they would still be mens clothes
  whats really interesting about this costume is that in botw where we definitely know that its just link the waist is undoubtedly a womans waist what do you suppose is going on there
   the waist is undoubtedly a womans waist  ive found that strange too
yyyep
  lets waste polygons and resources on animated 3d models that youll be able to see all of 3 pixels of    glowing ball gets the job done and is arguably more visibly apparent which is the entire purpose of the fairy
  they would obviously have just used a 2d sprite for the fairy if they made it human shaped you know like the glowing ball already is
so who else is mad
inquiring minds wish to know
  rand in god tier  wew lad
  its a meme image worst books are at the top and best books are at the bottom
wah
  why bump this has lasted almost a month theres nothing else to talk about
  theres always more to talk about with zelda zeldas lore is vast and deep
    by using a glowing ball they can get away with using just one sprite and pretending that she doesnt always face you see her wings turn around and shit if they used a humanoid sprite they wouldve needed a sprite for each horizontal angle and animations for all of those
  sure but ocarina of time was not really a game known for cutting corners besides that sprites werent really that detailed on the n64 anyway id attribute it more to being a stylistic choice than wanting to do less work
  yeah it probably is a stylistic choice but i wouldnt say that they didnt want to cut corners i mean we still dont know what the beta of the game was like and what it was going to be like before some changes were made maybe they were going for something even more ambitious we may never know my point is they do cut corners they always do because they have to thats why the games change from planning to the final product
  implying jungle beat isnt fun as all fuck  how much of a fag are you  and besides he was behind almost as much of it as miyamoto where he was involved in the core gameplay koizumi was in charge of the worldbuilding and programming the gameplay equal contributions in the end
  me too but then she shrieked and it went away
  she shrieked at literally the same time she appeared so that would be the quickest boner of all time    frankly i find it odd that people were actually turned on by her she looks so pointy and gross you know who really is bonerific from around the same time period shiva from final fantasy viii
  that is so true
feckless
  a populated overworld  none of the spyro hubworlds were populated the one or two moneybags buys dont count   also need i remind you of the subway image
  oh fuck i actually know the image youre talking about i didnt want to remember that i had successfully kept it out of my mind for years urgh
  me too
  forgot your hashtag
so was there a sheikah civil war at some point which resulted in spreading out and integrating into other societies eyes show up on a lot of different things and even the village that should be their homeland only has impa with most the population being normal hylians
  the sheikah were supposed to be virtually extinct by oot with impa one of the last of them kakariko was uninhabited until she opened it to the hylians
  i am glad she opened kakarikos borders and welcomed in a diverse culture
  oot was all about the triumph of multiculturalism over fascism look at the sages a kokiri a goron a zora a sheikah a gerudo and a fucking white male only together could they overcome evil
  with every race lusting after link cock
  even darunia huh
  is that dave mustaine
  cringe
  darunia isnt a race anon
  there arent any female gorons brandon
  shigeru miyamoto stopped him  no datto rook retaadedu
  and
  brandon please
  who the fuck is brandon
  who the fuck isnt brandon
well brandon
brandon
braaaaaaaaaaaaaaandon
    pretty sure kaepora gaebora and rauru are the same being
  just looked it up on the wiki and it seems this is canon that is weird i do not remember knowing this the wiki cites hyrule historia as the source but is that the first time it was revealed or is this some minutiae thats mentioned in the game that ive just forgotten because its been so long    it makes a lot of sense because i was trying to remember what the fuck rauru actually does in the game every other sage has some strong connection to link so him being kaepora gaebora explains a lot because kaepora gaebora has a pretty large presence in the game
why was the ps2 so successful  it seems like it was a great transition from the psx there was a lot of variety and a shitload of games on it for its time that hasnt been matched by the 7th or 8th generation
it had a dvd player
reported

allemagne  nearly every reference to a mythological creature in ff7 and xenogears was butchered

lets discuss a little about this great genre heres some initial questions in order to start a proper conversation but youre free to post anything you want anyway  whats your favorite franchise  for the serie you chose above what is in your opinion the best title  whos your favorite character  whats your favorite boss and/or enemy  whats your favorite soundtrack and/or single track  please be polite with other anons and be respectful of their own opinions constructive criticism is advised even though youre pretty much obliged to call them faggots if theyre using loweffort baits    this was pretty much my guideline but then again feel free to post more stuff such as informations easter eggs questions memes etc
  you spin me right round like a record baby
  i remember dino crisis 1 silent hill 12 and resident evil 2 wasnt such a huge fan of genre to remember any favourite character/boss/tune based on my picks is there another game i should check out
  whats your favorite franchise  resident evil i like sh but that has only 4 good games whereas i can get enjoyment out of every classic re and a few of the ones made after 03  for the serie you chose above what is in your opinion the best title  the original not even memeing for /vr/ point it is legitimately better than remake and the fact that autists on /v/ have the audacity to say its not as good or skippable is fucking offensive to the original designers and im sure both kamiya and mikami would hate comments like that as well as the original designer who worked on sweet home and came up with the idea  i also feel some additions to remake bog down the game in particular the extended caves section dont like the changes to the guardhouse either i prefer the flooded area to the aquatic ring  whos your favorite character  i prefer harry and heather from sh to most re characters but ill say claire for sex appeal and i really like steve never got the hate for him outside of his poor va i also enjoy chris character leon is just rule of cool for newfaggots and even then only in everything after gaiden  whats your favorite boss and/or enemy  alessa and claudia are great antagonists for re i like the ashford siblings lisa trevor and irons cant choose between the 3 though  whats your favorite soundtrack and/or single track  becursia is the name of the main theme of cv i believe they used it in all the codeveronica kanzenban trailers also like letter from the lost days sh3 hometown sh3 and re2s end credits theme
cant really choose between re or sh i suppose sh since sh2 is the best horror game ever made imo re1 is the best title for the series re ends with code veronica and sh ends with 4 so thats all im considering here    james is my favorite character for obvious reasons theres a lot to him hes very flawed and relatable pyramid head is my favorite conceptually and nemesis because he looks cool    as far as tracks go all re save room tracks are great and for sh id pick promise reprise and room of angel
  that autists on /v/ have the audacity to say its not as good or skippable is fucking offensive to the original designers  some additions to remake bog down the game    i agree completely
  survival horror    i had the realization that survival horror isnt really a genre theyre just 3d horror adventure games take an adventure game the point n click kind and now make it fully 3d this wasnt a new genre but it was an adaption of the genre to new hardware and opened up the accessibility of it to new people adventure games were always pretty cool featuring puzzles and traps but not that many people would be interested in sitting down and playing one
whats your favorite franchise  personally i dont have a favorite franchise because i like the classics indiscriminately theyre even different experiences to begin with if i want a pure gameplay with limited inventory and scarce ammo i boot up resident evil if i want to be really spooked while enjoying some nonbmovie like plot then itll be silent hill if i want another good story without renouncing to a complex gameplay i play parasite eve with its rpg approach on the genre if i want resident evil with dinosaurs and even more tedious puzzles dino crisis it is special mention to that beautiful game that is dc2 although it isnt a survival horror so  for the serie you chose above what is in your opinion the best title  this is very subjective  resident evil i think 3nemesis cuts the cake for me imho its the perfect union between scary setting/enemies a fluid gameplay and nice puzzles though i dont want to shit to the previous chapters because i liked those so much  silent hill although im tempted to say sh2 not retro because of the story and spooks i must ultimately confirm my love for the very first chapter its just a fun game overall with some of the most twisted shit ive ever seen in a videogame  parasite eve even for this one i liked 2 a lot fuck the psp spinoff though but i have a huge soft spot for the first one so  dino crisis again i liked 2 the most because of the setting the enemy variation the combo system the weapons the story etc but this isnt an actionadventure thread so im bound to say dc1 which i liked a lot too  whos your favorite character  that redhead slut whos name is regina  whats your favorite boss and/or enemy  stars   whats your favorite soundtrack and/or single track  although im tempted to say arise within you parasite eve battle theme i have to admit that imo the real deal are capcoms save themes
  clock tower on snes was the shit it had the atmosphere and a costant feeling of dread the 2d graphics were pleasant too too bad that anything that followed was shit  silent hill 1 is also one of my favorites the use of sounds ambiance and wtf moments was top tier  re had a feeling of mistery but wasnt as strong on the horror side i think its more a pervy kind of horror
  clock tower on snes was the shit it had the atmosphere and a costant feeling of dread the 2d graphics were pleasant too too bad that anything that followed was shit    clock tower 3 is good as is totally not clock tower aka haunting grounds
ive never played a survival horror game whats a good introduction to the genre
  ive never played a survival horror game whats a good introduction to the genre    resident evil 1 ps
    re / capcoms save themes  my negroids            very special mention listen and tell me your feelings about this one even though its not /vr/  
  i wasnt expecting such refined taste
         dual shock save theme is pretty solid too fun thing is that i played re4 and thought the save room theme was pretty cool but i had no idea it was a remix of the re1 theme since i had only played dual shock version
  resident evil 1 and silent hill 1
  youre not thinking hard enough especially with your pointclick comparison    survival horror is a sub genre of actionadventure    look up at the vg genre trees and at the top youll see the action and adventure genre    then there is the actionadventure sub genre  and then there is a sub genre of that called survival horror     its pretty simple take out the action mechanics twitch based controls  then it becomes an adventure game with a horror theme take out the adventure mechanics it becomes doom or house of the dead take out the horror and its just an actionadventure game    thats right contrary to popular survival horror are actiongames by definition    now some survival horror lean more towards action the aitd/re kind and some more towards adventure echo night etc but there is always at least a bit of the other side in the mix    tldr survival horror  actionadventure game with a horror theme and survival gameplay mechanics   actiontwitch based controls   adventure  puzzles figuring out where to go etc   survival gameplay mechanics item management making the player feel weaker than the odds hes facing  horror  proeminent horror theme throughout the game not just bits and pieces of gore like dino crisis 2 that are meant to horrify the player scare gross out feel uneasy etc
  the choice is yours if you go for the classics youre pretty much always covered if you find yourself not liking the title you picked up either give it one more chance or try another classic this because although the foundations of the genre are pretty much always there youll get everytime a different approach for things like story settings gunplay and so on obviously for example if youre more for great stories with twisted psychological facets and abominable unspeakable monsters you should go for silent hill if you like zombies tedious gameplay choices that nonetheless will make the game more interesting such as limited saves scarce resources etc try resident evil this regarding the most famous ones but i suggest you to keep an eye on both of them and why not even to more stuff of the same genre just avoid nusurvival horrors like the plague itself because those are nothing alike
    now  one could argue survival horror is not a real video game genre like you said but not for the reasons you stated only because video game genres are defined by gameplay mechanics and sh brings in the notion of theme horror into the mix    now though genres are made to easily classify and identify things so if it helps it might as well be there and considering nowadays the consensus is to call anything a genre and fuck gameplay mechanics i mean just look at the genre list on steam survival horror isnt worst than indie and whatever the fuck that indicates on the kind of game youre going to be playing
tfw cant discuss the best horror games like haunting ground fatal frame or siren on /vr/
  yep youre only stuck with the shitty ones survival horror as a genre only picked up in quality starting the ps2 ownards most retro ones by this boards standards range from shit to decent excluding the few golden ones we all know that    someone hoping hes going find some retro survival horror as good as re/sh/echo night is soon going to be drowning in shit
  s your favorite franchise   silent hill   the serie you chose above what is in your opinion the best title  silent hill 2  s your favorite character  dr kaufman  s your favorite boss and/or enemy  the ideal father piston room he knew how to have a good time   s your favorite soundtrack and/or single track   sh2  magdalene / the reverse will
  /v2k/ when
i dont really have a favourite franchise so ill just list the retro horror games that made me feel tense or spooked  silent hill  hellnight  clocktower the playstation one  dino crisis  resident evil 3nemesis  enemy zero    whos your favorite character  i like harry hes just a guy who wants to save his daughter and hes willing to go through hell to do it much more likable than james or henry  whats your favorite boss and/or enemy  i guess the mandatory boss fight against nemesis  whats your favorite soundtrack and/or single track  the entire sh1 ost some really unnerving stuff
  alessa and claudia are great antagonists  just a couple of days ago i finished playing first three silent hill games for the first time sh1 kind of missed me and i didnt even own ps2 to try the other two now all of the game were pretty good but i gotta say that sh3 plot fell flat for me in general the game felt all over the place but the cult plot is kind of meh    spoilers ahoy for anybody that cares    heather is reincarnation of 2 different people both of which lived at the same time one of whom was alessa who was supposed to give birth to a god but it failed thanks to harry but heather still bears the god so now claudia who is a halfsister to alessa wants to nurture that god in heather so it can properly give birth to it so it can bring paradise to earth    maybe because i remember just how scared and out of place heather looked in promotional material in ancient game mags i expected something completely different sh1 gave me b movie cult horror vibes sh3 felt like a horror shlock    solid gameplay and great graphics though the spooks were nice too
    thats because a small amount of people wanted a direct sequel to 1 since not many things were unexplained and 2 was a self contained story konami didnt get that the cult was just a backdrop it was never the focus of the game and it shouldnt be 3 used some elements of 2 with symbolism but it wasnt character driven enough instead relying on answering questions that didnt need answers
    looks like i had a stroke while typing this shit but you get the point
im playing parasite eve for the first time boy what ive missed this game is so great what do you think about maedas lucky charms even to this day people cant seem to grasp their meaning and what they do everytime im like yo wtf stop giving me this shit you yellow face i dont need it
  that would match what ive read on the internet silent hill 3 was initially something completely different more similar on the personal demons aspect of sh2 but allegedly it was scrapped for going too far considering how the sh3 we got has themes and subtle references to unwanted pregnancy i can see that    even without that hardcore stuff i think it would be simply better if heather wasnt connected to silent hills history in any way clearly the idea of dropping such young protagonist into our favorite misty town works    thats another thing  while the locations of sh3 were very atmospheric and in my opinion aesthetically the best in the series its kind of terrible how we spent barely any time in silent hill itself running through the fog listening for radio noises was a nice transition between locations the loop of foggy streets  normalworld location  location in otherworld worked and there was no reason to change that
   not to mention it was shorter than 2 it feels similar to the tomb raider situation where they suddenly had a smash hit and had to keep the money train going the sequels were still good but definitely suffered for that reason 1 and 2 are fresh on my mind i still need to grab 3 and 4 for my collection 4 did the psychological stuff better than 3 but theres even less time spent in actual silent hill
  not to mention it was shorter than 2  now that you mention it i did finish it with almost the exact same time as sh1 hell even the last boss was similarly boring    about silent hill 4  i kind of have on interest in it i recall watching fragments of a speedrun of it looked bad and i mean really bad sh3 was overall pretty nice experience for me but sh4 feels like a chore
  answering questions that didnt need answers
   4 has a worse reputation than it deserves it changes things that it shouldnt limited inventory movement is weird and the hole thing is also weird the apartment gimmick is cool though and it has some cool visuals though it toned down the symbolism its also linked with sh2 since a character mentioned in 2 is the main bad guy its foggy in my memory but yeah 1 and 2 are quite better than 3 and 4 with 2 being the best of the genre and one of the best games ever made
  while it was a cool moment wasnt it confirmed that he was joking or that it was his own version of silent hill
since were discussing nonretro sh what do you guys think about siren  its amazing odd and maddening to play which sounds like something this board would love
  im pretty sure that vincent and heather both saw the same things but from his perspective they were angeliclike holy figures since he was a cult member and was curious as to why heather thought they were monsters
why the fuck was this nigger there
  okay now my dick is hard i fucking love that woman the fact that she was the model for jill and that she cosplayed as her and posed in this sexy shoot and that i finally get to see her actual baresoles as her character holy fuck this is unreal im gonna jerk off now like the pathetic faggot that i am thanks for this post anon i love you in a none homosexual way
  one of the best horror games ever made imo if bizarrely crippled by some decisions so hilariously perfectly awful that they could only have been intentional its a really weird game    i read a good review somewhere that made the point that where sh uses a basic story as a springboard for various spooky setpieces that are only loosely connected through theme siren is like the opposite everything is connected literal concrete theres no metaphor or symbolism at all it takes a while to get into because of that youre just swapping between characters and it feels kind of distant and unimmersive but once you get to know the characters and the situation learn the connections see your favourites start to die off it starts to grab you in a way unlike many other horror games    theres the stock character in horror of the professor guy who studies the ancient evil and goes mad from what he learns thats the guy siren makes you feel like
  too many escort missions in a genre that should be about isolation  not a fan of its mission structure either or redoing missions shouldve just stuck with one character  pretty good games otherwise
  now all of the game were pretty good but i gotta say that sh3 plot fell flat for me  i love sh13 but 3 did have some issues with the plot it was weird how heather suddenly started being sassy and making quips and it felt rushed with her realization that shes alessa near the end im not sure why they failed with the character arc when 2 did it pretty decently maybe it was because they were rushed to do something else after their first idea had to be scrapped but its still decent at times
  whats your favorite franchise  silent hill  for the serie you chose above what is in your opinion the best title  1 for the industrial elements which give it a unique atmosphere and i think if you dont focus so hard on the cult aspect its story is just as good as 2s i think 1 benefits the most from replaying to really appreciate it though but i only barely put it above 2 which i also love and 2 ahead of 3 by a little more  whos your favorite character  maybe alessa even though she doesnt have a ton of cutscenes or dialogue i feel like you can get enough of her character indirectly through level and enemy design and what you see of her that way which is why i think 1 benefits the most from replaying because you dont really learn about her until later in the game which makes you miss out on some stuff in the beginning  whats your favorite boss and/or enemy  the flying enemies in 1 because they seem to vary what you do the most in your encounters with them  whats your favorite soundtrack and/or single track  1s ost overall but betrayal and angelas hell from 2 and lost carol from 3 deserve mentions too
  im going to be wandering the earth forever as a ghost if i never find out who the heck is inezh from re1s live action fmvs  charlie kraslavsky is chris credits charlie  greg smith as barry credits gregory  eric pirius as wesker credits eric  jason wool as joseph credits jason    no one knows who jill is and no one is bothering to look at someone with first name inezh even with all other actors names matching the credits  fuck
    inezh sounds totally made up its either an anagram fro her real name or its a mishearing of her actual name     henzi  enezi  zenih
whats your favorite franchise  its a tie between classic re and the sh trilogy  for the series you chose above what is in your opinion the best title  remake and re3 from re and silent hill 2 and 3 from sh  whos your favorite character  jill valentine chris redfield rebecca chambers and heather mason  whats your favorite boss and/or enemy  perhaps ive played remake too many times but none of the bosses really stand out to me so i vote nemesis because he actually feels like a boss also every boss in sh3   whats your favorite soundtrack and/or single track  akira yamaoka  breeze in monochrome night    that said dino crisis one might be the best survival horror game the bullet counting was unparalleled perhaps i am misremembering at is has been a while but i have fond memories of finding no more than a few of those ohk darts and calculating which enemy needed to die above all others and then dodging everything elsefucking great game
  as far as i know theyre just a plot device for delaying giving you the maeda bullets
parasite eve is one of my favorite games ever madebut its not a survival horror game
  inez is a common first name
  pretty much pe2 copied a lot of stuff from re but it never even tried to be scary also unlimited ammo resupplies take the survival part away
  pretty good reminds me of killer7
  it was there to let you know that there were monsters back out in the main hall again even if you killed them previously you hear the cat die out there come back out and sure enough theres more gray children or micromumblers       favorite franchise geez  its a tie between resident evil and silent hill   best title  resident evil 4  and silent hill 1   favorite character boss and enemy  jack krauser and pyramid head   favorite soundtrack  prisonic fairytale sh 2    reasons  resident evil 4 stuff is obvious re2 should have been remade as if it were 4 without a gun merchant of course  silent hill 1 had more dynamic enemies between the dogs flying monsters and the leapers than in the other games they were more dangerous and you actually had to run from them and with the leapers you really couldnt even run  i disliked sh2 because the character plot was an aside he didnt have anything to do with the town he had just been there a few times and i disliked sh3 for a number of reasons even if it furthered the depth of the storyline and had some of the best graphics of the series topped only by downpour i think    since i had watched the movie and knew some of the plot for the second game i was expecting pyramid head to show up in the 1st game and was disappointed when he didnt i was scared out of my shit when i solved the first puzzle with the 3 keys that led to the back yard the music changing and the sky going dark again i thought ph was going to be right in the back yard just off camera or would be right out in the alley    if someone ever remakes silent hill 1 with better graphics the introduction of a recurring pyramid head is an absolute must i suggest he be put right there for the first encounter set off camera by the gate so the player can possibly get chopped if theyre hasty and show up in other unexpected places   symbolically the protector of dark alessa who is running around town placing the marks
lately ive been thinking about resident evil as if it was an interactive fiction game is survival horror doable as an if game
  holy shit fuck off  4fag  downpour topped the graphics which is fucking wrong by a longshot if you look at the kids alone  not understand phs symbolism and exclusivity to 2 something that every director of the games and movies fucked up after 4
  i like pyramid head and understand why hes a fan favorite but i really wouldnt want him added to 1 i feel like itd just be fanservice that dilutes the meaning behind him harry was already kind of acting like her protector anyway
    this is the sort of person that makes /vr/ a worse place
  silent hill 1 had more dynamic enemies between the dogs flying monsters and the leapers than in the other games  i noticed that too after recently replaying 13 i never really feel scared playing the games although stuff like what happened to lisa alessas ending marys letter and angela going up the stairs all gets to me and makes me choke up sometimes but 1s enemies made the game feel more tense than the others
every silent hill was better than any re game
  if we only count 13 perhaps  the sh series really always had such better story  atmosphere than re because it took itself seriously
    re were action games with horror elements  sh were horror games with action elements    well maybe not exactly true with sh1 and sh3 but you get the idea
is first person silent hill 1 mod anon here i dunno where to check for an update    also faves are sh1 and re2
  this gif this game is such stupid trash man how i hate that fucking shit game so fucking retarded
/v/  most posts about silent hill 1 are people shitting on it and just saying the cult plot sucks  /vr/  more people saying sh1 is their favorite and giving reasons why  mfw
  going on /v/ ever
  unfortunately i dont have any answer for you but im curious to know why some people would like playing it that way i mean sure why not if youve done already all the endings personally i think that the idea of a lowpoly fp silent hill could be very nice ive also watched some videos about it so i have the confirmation but if i have to renounce to that smart theatrical camera work of the original thing then ill gladly refuse still theres an option ingame for quasifp view iirc after you beat the game so i may be wrong on thinking that there isnt any appeal
  i dont even know why i myself wrote about pe in the first place heavily implying that its a survival horror maybe the reason why i did so is because at a younger age everyone i knew compared it to the real deal so maybe i did it on instinct hell even wikipedia itself calls it that way although we all know that community wikis are easily wrong especially regarding this stuff however by simply looking at the staples of the genre its very easy to discern which ones are survival horrors and which arent in fact pe is an action rpg horror if we want but definitely not a survival one  also  that fucking picture  she needs some heavy parasitic rape
  aya is for consensual sex with white men only
  wrong
  she never fucked him and canonically only had white boyfriends  also she is not white she is hapa
  the more you say these things and the more i want her to be raped by a parasitic nigger
  its rather interesting how the niggers in the game were widowers
  i love you
didnt know silent hill could get even more eerie with the pure work of glitches 
  love it but too much of a faggot to beat it
  if theres one game where theres no shame in using a walkthrough its siren
  didnt she fuck wayne though the wepons guy he was a mexican
  didnt she fuck wayne though  no maybe you were shipping them in your headcanon
  and hexen ii /ot
   hell even wikipedia itself calls it that way although we all know that community wikis are easily wrong especially regarding this stuff  at one point wikipedia listed left 4 dead killing floor and dead space extraction the rail shooter on the wii as survival horror     its still very loose with the genre youll see other games listed as first person shooter / survival horror as if thats not an oxymoron but it seems like the main problem is that people think survival horror means any sort of horrorthemed game regardless of the gameplay looking again even the typing of the dead is listed as a survival horror its ridiculous
  part of it is caused by zoomers who grew up in a time after survival horror games stopped being made and being unfamiliar with the genre but having heard the phrase many times just call any horror game coming out survival horror thats why we have people thinking that dead space is a survival horror series or that re revelations or the leon campaign in re6 is a return to survival horror just for the fact that it attempts to develop some atmosphere
  whats your favorite franchise  a tie between sh and re really the good games in the series only which re has more of so re would of course be the better overall franchise here    for the series you chose above what is in your opinion the best title  second game for both however the actual scarier games for both is probably the first imo     whos your favorite character  leon overall as for re women i would say jill for sh i would go with harry     whats your favorite boss and/or enemy  well pyramid head is my favorite monster design ever whether game monster or not for re always like the licker enemy    whats your favorite soundtrack and/or single track  sh    re  
  people thinking that dead space is a survival horror series  is it not
  its the same as re4 or gears
  what predominately excludes re4 from the genre not trying to be a dick here but although everything is significantly watered down in it it seems on the cusp of the genre
  it loses the survival element of survival horror as well as any elements that make it similar to point and clicks  you buy weapons now you can also buy health items key items arent in your main inventory and go to an infinite inventory instead and many other reasons  dead space has a lot of the same issues
  or its a mishearing of her actual name  inez exists and is common a theory i have is that inezh is simply a weird corruption of the name that is actually used not too hard to imagine some russian exchange student with an odd name applying for some low tier acting gigs to cover the bills
  that seems like a fair distinction and to be honest i can see some of the reasons for the changesthat the creators were more concerned with building systems they thought would be fun rather than being strictly beholden to a set of characteristics that define the genre i appreciate you sharing your thoughts
  re4 its not a real survival horror more like an action horror this because youre not struggling to survive you have pretty much a lot of ammo and health treatment on the contrary of previous titles the inventory management is pretty much nonexistent if compared to said titles i admit ive spent a lot of time doing tetris on that suitcase but i was never on the edge like the very very limited version of the previous chapters but coming back to what ive said first i know that the survival aspect mixes puzzles horror and so on but the action was never so predominant actually theres a lot of it but on re4 we could say that is exaggerated
  its a tps with an emphasis on horror the gameplay is mostly walking room to room killing everything under the pretext of activate the generator or some other objective it gives less ammo than a most tps and its more tense than other nonhorror shooters but it doesnt really have any gameplay connection to the survival horror genre
  the camera angle change between re13 and re4 represents a lot about the change in overall gameplay that re4 took    the static camera angles in 13 emphasized the rooms which you explored for key items and resources while if the rooms contained enemies they may not even be visible immediately the room itself is always the main focus and what the camera directs you towards and were more of an obstacle or a shit test that would just add tension to the exploration aspect as did the limited inventory system    in re4 the rooms may contain important items but youre streamlined into finding them and rather than having to manage the items and figure out what to do with them theyre put in an unlimited key item inventory and autoused when you get to the right spot only really serving to activate scripts that result in a combat sequence the camera directs your attention towards the enemies first and foremost and not only are the combat mechanics changed to emphasize fighting the enemies precision shooting mechanics and powerful melee attacks used to control and take out whole hordes of enemies but virtually every part of the game revolves around locking you in a room until youve killed every wave of enemies like the other guy pointed out you also collect gold and use it to buy new weapons and upgrades and even the enemies regularly drop healing items and ammunition to keep the action flowing
  it loses the survival element of survival horror as well as any elements that make it similar to point and clicks  do you really define survival horror by similarity to point and click  you buy weapons now you can also buy health items  you cannot buy health items in re4  key items arent in your main inventory and go to an infinite inventory instead and many other reasons  riiight because inventory juggling and a key takes up the same space as a shotgun were genre defining characteristics
  you cannot buy health items in re4  what are first aid spray
  do you really define survival horror by similarity to point and click  yes actually most good survival horror games bear a strong similarity to point and clicks with emphasis on combining and using items to solve puzzles  you cannot buy health items in re4  f aid sprays can be bought from the merchant retard  riiight because inventory juggling and a key takes up the same space as a shotgun were genre defining characteristics  they were it meant you couldnt carry more than 2 weapons or else youd be fucking yourself over it forced you to plan your game what should you take do you need to grab that herb when should you go back to the item box  re4 lacks this entirely and is a weaker re game for it as the game literally becomes hurr durr shoot da zombies
  0 saves  my man
  whats your favorite franchise  resident evil dino crisis is also awesome    for the serie you chose above what is in your opinion the best title  resident evil 2 it was a blast when i played this as a kid re3 is a close second but ive played it years after    whos your favorite character  leon kennedy    whats your favorite boss and/or enemy  maybe mrx or the hunters    whats your favorite soundtrack and/or single track  theres so many maybe set at your ease from dino crisis one more kiss and that battle theme from re2
  whats your favorite franchise  resident evil  for the serie you chose above what is in your opinion the best title  re3  2 is great contentwise but i like the feel of 3 more  whos your favorite character  wesker damn those sunglasses  whats your favorite boss and/or enemy  boss nemesis  enemy basic zombies aside from being the most iconic enemy theyre the only one that i dont get pissed off by when i enter a room with them lickers get credit though for that introductory cutscene in re2 and walking across the window in the room before  whats your favorite soundtrack and/or single track  while everyone of course loves the save room themes one track thats often overlooked is the main theme to resident evil outbreak as used in the intro video which is itself great  
going through sh1 for the first time should i have played this game on hard i picked normal and my inventory is filled with healing items and i have enough ammo for my pistol to gun down anything that i cant run by im at the part where you lower the bridge to the next part of the town so im not sure how far im in yet    also i dont like the radio it really ruins the surprise of enemies being in a room to me
  the game isnt very hard if you do your exploring you will have plenty of stuff as far as i remember the inventory was infinite  is a goddamn queermo  youre like one third in past the hardest puzzle    you can turn off the radio
  sh had infinite inventory in exchange for more elements that make it similar to point and clicks like asinine puzzles putting the ring on the chains to keep the fridge closed so the insta death octopus doesnt get you
    thanks man ive done a rank 0 save runs on all classic res already im moving on to 10 star runs on silent hill games since they seem harder to do havent started yet since you need to get all endings before attempting those
  dont worry anon you will run out of everything when you enter school 
does hard difficulty in sh1 change the puzzles or just affect combat
  but i already went through the school unless theres another school i have to go through
  just combat
imagine killing moles instead of children on silent hill satisfaction gone
  i remember seeing both which version was which
  iirc ntscj and pal had mumblers while ntscu had grey child
  the pal demo had grey children at least such a tease      mumblers will always appear in the sewers
  true i forgot let me rephrase that then if i go to a school on silent hill i want to slay some childrenlike abominations not something as nonsense as that im perfectly fine with them being in a sewer though
  but why sounds like you have a good rant in you
  indie isnt a genre its just a tag for indie games
i wish but it will never happen  pic related
  what am it
tfc remastered with original physics maps and conc jumping its all i want i never liked tf2 as much and i hated all the added weapons and inventory stuff    i used to play tfc in a league back in 1999 and it was the best time i ever had gaming and ill never feel that again
  tell me more    been playing a lot of tf2 and i am really in love with it
  its a shame that fortress forever kind of came and went because thats close to what it could have been i still think they could give it a relaunch with new models and visual direction
tfc was the greatest from the basements of 2fort to the sniperspots of well to the bloodbaths of dustbowl man i miss that game so much
  there are still a few servers around with actual people playing them its not graphically remastered but its still just as fun as it was back in the day the only difference is back then on dial up i had to lead someone by like 3 seconds to hit them now it hits where i shoot
  in what ways does tf2 come up short compared to tf
  rock2
  nice post my friend now fuck you 
  i wish the beta tf2 came out
  wasnt someone making an universal castleroid engine with selectable physics and asset rips from all sprite based castlevanias and metroids also mmz for some reason    i remember seeing some screens a while back
eg gamesharks    action replay for pc  
hell yes i did and still do but it really depends on the game mostly its just to fuck around in a game ive already beat but sometimes a game will come along with a bullshit difficulty spike or an amount of grinding i am not prepared to sit through
  the only reason i could see anyone using gamesharks or action replays now are to play imports and backups
  sometimes a game will come along with a bullshit difficulty spike or an amount of grinding i am not prepared to sit through  then dont play it pussy
  i knew that was coming    assumes all retro games are well balanced and worth playing
  most of my old copiers let you use cheat codes so even though i dont use that function i technically use hardware that let you cheat
  i used a playstation gameshark cdx and game genie on nes emulators i had that same gba gameshark back in the day and i remember the build quality was horrible within a year it was chipping apart the plastic cover for the button in the corner popped off and the front/back casing was separating from each other it was a neat little thing but it literally fell apart in your hands like every third party product did
i learned hexadecimal when i was 9 thanks to an action replay it introduced me to programming and electronics and now im make a decent living out of it    i used to look for glitches with them all the time and to discover new codes which werent in books i had no internet at home back then now im seldom using them to look for hidden contents and to document them on tcrfnet    regardless of any opinion on these gaming landscape will but much more dull if these hardware cheating devices didnt existed
  yep thats all i use mine for
  never im a true gamer
  why even play a shit game      the only thing i ever used it for was to unlock all cards in ygo wc06 because i hate farming  also speed hack for pokémon games 15x is just the right speed and 2x or 3x in combat speed hacks are a must in any game which has a bunch of monotonous movement or a fuck ton of text which you cant disable
  why even play a shit game  some bad games can have redeeming qualities
  same used action replay max to soft mod my ps2
  nowadays i dont have that much fun with cheat codes anymore and just try to play games legitimately but back then the game genie on nes and gameboy was pretty amazing to mess with the books it came with were also pretty neat    never had any experiences with action replay but might pick one of them up on the snes or playstation someday just to do some dumb things once in a while i dont see much of a point to use those cheat devices with original hardware unless youre nostalgic about them because nowadays its much easier to use cheat codes or just emulator based actions that make games much less challenging
    i see this a lot with the complete zelda timeline playthroughs    they get to zelda 2 and its constant savestates and them saying i hate zelda2 what a stupid game black sheep dark souls of zelda etc i even saw one bust out the game genie   its like why are you even playing if you literally hate the game and you have to use infinite hp just watch a walkthrough at this point then they get to maybe palace 3 max and stop streaming and you never see them stream zelda2 again
personally i enjoy collecting them though i use them mostly for fucking around  the one on the right for the famicom for example has an underclock feature can backup savegames and can do rom and ram modifying codes which is pretty neat
  actually meant the one on the left
  umm why the fug would you want underclock on a nes
  i dunno just thought its a pretty unusual feature  there are some controllers that have something akin to this but all that normally does is press start over and over    i guess it could be helpful with quick action shoot em ups
  muh hardcore   
  famicom    never seen or even heard of them before im guessing the underclocking allows you to play games in slowmode
  i imported a action replay mk3 from the uk for the snes it isnt the latest release but whatever it is able to do live code searching and it works pretty great
itt rare vidyas you had as a kid that youre kicking yourself for not keeping
    i had a new copy of metal warriors i traded it in when i got rid of my snes turns out it was one of only 50000 copies made and a mint version is worth 2000 just the cart can go for hundreds
  are you me  i still miss playing as that divebombing fuck in h2h
  i sold it for 5 back in 1998
  implying i would ever get rid of my wife umis game
  i had the umi variant when i was little and was upset that i didnt get one of the other two  kid me had patrician taste forced upon her and she didnt even recognize it
    my disc is hikaru i like hikaru but i would have loved that umi disc my friend had fuu
  tfw i kept all my games and systems     i wish i kept my copies of old gaming magazines though
i had to throw out all the boxes for my pc games because i ran out of wardrobe space i owned all these amazing pc games in the 90s  still have the discs and the manuals but the boxes are all top soil now      jazz jackrabbit cd  outlaws  the dig  phantasmagoria  the last express  bad mojo  total distortion  spycraft  twinsens odyssey  interstate 76  blood  blade runner  discworld 1 2 and noir  halflife     all of it gone i feel so sad thinking about it and space is certainly no issue now
  are her eyes okay i was thinking about replaying this for the nostalgia trip but if thats what the cutscenes really looked like
    thats from the anime its clamp bitch
  oh yeah i guess  ive never seen it i tried to watch it in like 2004 but i somehow wound up with the ova which was not great
the only valuable game i ever sold was digimon world but i guess its not that valuable in the grand scheme of things
   with the ova    the ova wasweird but you should watch the tv series season 1 especially 2 is a bit more polarizing but 1 ends in a complete enough way
  okay i will thanks anon i never get to discuss this even though its one of my top five vidyas
    nows a great time to watch anyways as the series was just finally announced to appear in super robot wars
  why do emubabies never post a pic of that sd they sold to buy weed in these threads
  either this thread was intense larping which i wouldnt put past 4chan or op really had it as a kid and sold it lost it etc
    you know they did sell this shit commercially its not weird for someone to have actually had it and pawned off all their shit because seriously who would have predicted this fuck fest
  well thats the point of the thread isnt it people that had these nowultrarare games regretting their decisions to part with them
  to give you a more recent nonretro example i bought metroid prime trilogy on release the one with the metal case and artbook but had to sell it due to lack of money i thought whatever its metroid surely i can buy it again some other time theres no way its going to be expensive in the near future its fucking metroid there was no way i or anyone really could predict the disc itself would cost around 100    so to sum it up its very possible that op bought magic knight rayearth and sold it because hey its impossible this game based on a popular anime is going to be very rare in the future and yet it happened
  i know countless people who sold all their games on release of a nextgen console to cover the cost
  wd translation  not a big loss honestly
reminder were getting mkr in super robot taisen next year  its finally happening
sold my cib copy of splatterhouse 3 for a couple bucks even back then i felt uneasy about selling it but i needed the money       had mkr along most of the other saturn big hitters sold them off as an adult tho for a lot of money way more than i bought them for but if i would hung on a couple years longer i could have made waaaay more those saturn game prices are just beyond retarded now
  i still miss playing as that divebombing fuck in h2h  that vs mode was amazing me and my friends played it so much we made up tournaments and a championship    great times
i paid 950 for chaos break in 2009 and it seems to be worth about 80 now
  magic knight fuck this gayearth
never would have thought this would end up as a sought after game because at the time i thought it wasnt very good  not /vr/ or even vidya but i never would have let the family dog get a hold of my scratch tmnt figure if i had known better who ever would have thought that stupid fucking cat would end up as rarest and most expensive toy in the line
  i want to punch my brother for giving away his copy of the sega cd it costs more than the lords penis nowadays
  why would i ever buy us shit
  this moved out of my parents house had to get rid of 40 pounds of game mags from the 90s damn shame
  why would you even buy this as a kid
seirou okamoto does fuck all music apart from this game
    because its awesome
  i predicted it and took advantage of it about 20 years ago i started buying up everything i saw for a ridiculously low price it cost me a few grand to fill a whole room and everything has increased in value tens or hundreds or times
i still have the receipt of my mkr copy from eb games  without a wrinkle
  my friend gave me gold for free so i played that i loved it because it was optimized for color and it was a nice graphic improvement over red that i was playing before that
  silver my brother had gold but neither of us even got close to collecting all the pokemon for it to warrant us trading it was the last gen either of us cared about
  silver god this was the only new pokemon generation that was actually intriguing
  i had silver but once crystal was announced to have the option of playing as a boy or a girl i got excited and got crystal and played the heck out of it
kin
  silver because my cousin had gold in retrospect i think i got the better version
  i got silver cause i thought lugia looked way cooler
  those two and 4 others
silver first then gold then crystal
  i played gold but it sucked and pokemon was dead at this point red/blue/yellow 4ever
  left but in english
  red/blue did nothing that gold/silver didnt do better
  silver
silver because it had the elephants which i didnt even end up using it also happened to have skarmory which is the only truly notable exclusive
  i had silver and my brother gold i traded in my silver to buy ruby because my brother stopped playing pokemon and therefore i could play it whenever i wanted
  red/blue had good pokemon
crystal
  silver but obviously crystal 
  blue/yellow 4ever  this was me i loved pokemon and was caught up in the craze like everyone else but by gold/silver i was burned out and not interested
  queer
silver ive been wanting to revisit these but have been putting it off due to the dead battery on the cartridge i just bought a soldering kit so i think its time
  gen 2 had all the pokemon from gen 1 plus more and with alternate colors
  there is more gen 1 in gen 2 than gen 2  thats one of the worst things about it      played silver after ruby  day nigt  radio  understandable phone system  kanto  johto mons they were still dripfeeding us in the newer games  shit blew my mind back then
  both
  i played gold for a week when a friend lent it to me and was amazed by it compared to yellow my first pokemon later when i was like fourteen i got silver and played it through and through on my gba  when heartgold came out on ds i played it too  its the last pokemon game i played actually
  are you me
  gold lugia sucks
being able to trade up your mons in the virtual console versions is one of the best things nintendo has ever done playing crystal right now but i plan on getting and playing through g/s later
  we couldnt afford either when they came out but i saved up and got crystal when it launched fucking love that game
silver every kid loved lugia and his long strong neck and phallic shape that reminded them of their dads penis
  now im very surprised i cant find a chad drawing of pic related
  does it work only online or also local wifi
  gold i just thought hooh looked cooler i played that bad boy until the internal battery died
  gen autism
  emerald
  siruba
  
  online only through pokémon bank for now
i played a lot of rby but when gs came out it felt like a shitty rom hack with terrible designs shitty map and shitty story it was so bad i quit the franchise only started playing pokemon again years later with dp
  how can you be so objectively wrong about literally every single thing  holy shit
  ur opinion is wrong  my opinion is right
  facts arent subjective gs is what gf wanted rb to be but didnt have the budget to do so  the designs are also finalized ideas from the original 151  you cant objectively shit on gs without shitting on rb as well since theyre essentially an upgrade to the first game    dp is also when nintendo streamlined the pokemon designs they look nothing like the originals from an artistic standpoint
    if your old cartridge still has a working battery you can pull your original save with a joey joeybags or something similar and then inject it into the virtual console version if you 3ds is hacked
  gold
  got yellow and silver for christmas so that was my gen 1 and gen 2 experience
  ur opinion is wrong  my opinion is right    also  source  your ass
  anyone know if certain romhacks like pure silver or pure gold can trade with real cartridges     could i catch a mew in pure gold then trade it back towards red
  dawg just get a monster brain
  both but silver first
    only a few romhacks guarantee support the only two i know of are the recent green translation really just a blue resin and crystal clear these two will trade between legit carts work with coliseum and even work with poke transfer if imported into vc properly cc even has a specific npc to fix the hacked rby mew to make it transferable    anything that adds fakemon other gen moms or even hacks like the split wont work at all
silver lugia was always cooler   im convinced most people played gold because it was slightly cheaper
  silver to this day i prefer lugia over hooh especially with how strongly defensive it is
  silver then several years later crystal
  both  idiot
  read bulbapedia you uncultured ass thats all well known pieces of history regarding the series  rb even had slots for some of the gs mons most notably marill/pikablu    how can someone be so stupid holy shit
my parents imported me a copy of silver from japan via pocketmonsterscom if you want to trip out on nostalgia take a look at that site on the way back machine
  nathan
  ur opinion is wrong  my opinion is right    also  source  your ass
  gold still had vivid moments getting hyped for buying it and when i did it was pure bliss did the pokemon movie came before or after this gen
gold  gen 2 was amazing after you beat it you could challenge the old world im gonna play it right now
    
crystal is censored in japan too right
  pokemon movie was released in the west in the run up to gen 2 i think seeing donophan for the first time blew my mind considering id by that stage memorised the original 151
   opinion is wrong   opinion is right  also  source   ass
  yea cuz i remember the pokemon craze when the movie showed up i think they gived you the mewtwo card gen 1 and 2 where the top of the series not sure why after the 3rd fell into decline dont remember
  the movie also had snubbull and marill which we all at the time thought was pikablu
  i learned of the existence of gen 2 games from a kid who had gold so that was the version i had in mind when i got my own copy
ive been playing red and crystal the past week and these game are unplayable without the emulator speed on at least 3x
  i think i played silver originally and heartgold when the remakes came out
  silver that was the first one i played as a kid where i was old enough to actually get what was going on unlike when i bumbled through r/b it was tight realizing i could go explore kanto afterwards was amazing
  silver    these games were legit amazing as a kid
  this tbqh i cannot play pokemon without boost  so fucking boring i was spoiled by emulators when i was a kid  later generations are even slower
  does bootleg gold count  after that i bought silver  pokemon games will never be like this again but dont tell that to /vp/ otherwise they will start listing every improvement since rs ignoring gs is the only set of games not being a rby rethread
    the new crystal clear romhack has an autorun that is as fast as a back and lets you skip pretty much all animations    for a pure gen 2 romhack that remains compatible with the legitimate games so far as even being able to use poke transporter if you inject it into vc it is quite playable and enjoyable
  where do you catch mewtwo in gold/silver/crystal
  triggered
  silver first game i ever owned
  are you cute
  i got gold because before i got blue and my brother got red so my parents thought switching made sense based on the pokemon on the cartridge
  you trade it in
  is a baby that googled the differences of games older that zit and zhit posted cute  my grams always said all babies are cute but she didnt live long enough to see that one
  chris
  objectively best generation no pokémon matters after this
  lmao imagine being poor
  is it worth playing any of gen 2 sometimes i get a pokemans itch  furthest i got is the wiggling tree blocking the path or some town with casinos and bike paths nearby
    they can be tough to play    id recommend a romhack like crystal clear instead it is actually free roam and has a bunch of qol improvements fully compatible with the legit games too
      holy shit he proved you wrong and you just dug your heels in    
  hey this sounds like its right up my alley  do i have to apply a patch on lips
  based schizo poster
    yea they have a bps file in their discord you just apply to a crystal rom
   opinion is wrong   opinion is right  also  source   ass
silver i forget if it was because i have an aversion to gold and dad was making me wear a lot of it at the time or if it was because lugia was rad either way my sister got gold  ten years later i got her heartgold for nostalgias sake when i got soulsilver and she got pissed about how im too old to remember what studying in high school was like shes less than a year younger than me
   gold lyfe 
for me it was silver  i still even have my fantranslated copy of silver i bought on a flea market back when gs havent been released in europe  ive beaten it several times until the official release
  why did your dad make you wear a lot of gold and why was your sister angry you forgot what studying in high school was like anon
  oh look its this guy again the one who doesnt mind his business just to make convo
  oh look its this guy again the one that underage shit posts just so he can tell his mom he got a post on the four channel
  unfortunately both
        choose wisely
didnt have a gameboy so i just played whichever version with an emulator usually crystal i think only one classmate of mine had a gameboy he had pokémon blue
  torrented blue and silver  played on a dos emulator under os/2 warp 4 dboy  my dad set it up for me was pretty awesome  was the last pokem
  vietnamese silver that came in a 32inone cartridge it miraculously saved and i could get to goldenrod before it glitched up so much that at that point that i gave up
  i didnt play either of them because the marketing and packaging for the games convinced me they could only be played on game boy color but i only had a regular game boy i didnt find out you could play them on a regular game boy until a couple years ago and i was pissed i still havent played them because i lost interest in pokemon after not being able to play gold/silver and i never got back into it
  i emulated crystal
gold because i thought hooh was cooler than lugia
  dont think so
  lol this wouldve been back in either 2000 or 2001 in illinois
is it just me or did crystal have the best sprite animations out of any goddamn pokemon game
  its not just you all the later games used either a couple of frames with shitty hardware rotation/scaling or lame 3d models
went from blue / yellow to silver / crystal as a kid these sequels felt completely magical they doubled the size of the world and i dug the mystery of the ruins of alph and the presentation of the legendaries in this gen rescuing that mall tower and doing the lake of rage mission with lance also felt way cooler than any of the team rocket areas from the 1st gen
  t that kid that would whip out a mewtwo in cable link battles because he was too lazy to build a proper team
  if i win i win bro i dont have time to waste abiding to your shitty self made rules
  soul  heart having a soul is more important than having a heart
i like hooh better but silver is the superior color hooh is cool because phoenixes are beautiful i still dont understand what the hell lugia is supposed to be though it looks like a bird with fists you find it in an underground lake it uses water attacks and is classified as psychic/flying someone explain
crystal is the definitive version with one major exception and that is mareep
god i remember how much ruby and sapphire were such a disappoint after all the cool features and content crystal had what the fuck happened to gamefreak emerald did seem to pick up where crystal left off though i played the shit out of post game
  i think they shouldve had every game connect to the previous region as postgame it provides a good sense of progression and connectivity and lets the player see whats happened in the interim
  just a quick hackjob done for a movie then shoehorned in the games
  silver
the best fighting game
  thats not virtua fighter
  fpbp
  the only /vr/ virtua fighter that was decent was 3tb
not even close my man its better than tekken 4 ill give you that but it cant hold a candle to any vf after 3 or even doa3 jp
i remember when i first saw this running on a ps2 at launch it looked literally unbelievable
  horrendously broken game  best
none of these shitty 3d fighting games posted in this thread beat any decent 2d ones  but of the shitty 3d fighting games posted here virtua fighter is the best one posted    list of 3d fighting games better than the op  every soul calibur  every doa  most other tekken games  battle arena toshinpsoneclassicden  every 3d bloody roar  fighters megamix  all 3d mortal kombats  powerstone 1 and 2  xmen mutant academy   yuyu hakasho dark tournament  arms  ballz  casltevania judgment  godzilla unleashed  rumble roses xx  kensei  bushido blade 1 and 2  dark rift  mace the dark age  naruto clash of ninja and ultimate ninja  dbz budokai  inuyasha fuedal combat  war gods  and of course battle raper
what was it like in the 80s when arcade games were at the height of their popularity  i was born in 89 so i didnt really get to experience the true arcade experience outside of some nickel nickel and some arcades in vegas casinos      do arcade games have a place in modern society
  what was it like in the 80s when arcade games were at the height of their popularity    the greatest thing ever created by humanity almost every story you have heard about them is at least slightly inaccurate and they were probably very different from how you think they were    do arcade games have a place in modern society    probably not for many different reasons
  elaborate  what was the average experience like what kind of people were in attendance
  what was it like in the 80s when arcade games were at the height of their popularity  it was great   i was born in 89  90s were a golden time for arcades too friend
  my arcade experiences were limited as a kid i was a console kid mostly
  i was fortunate grew up in a time where arcades were booming i was fascinated with them as a little kid i was so curious how they worked i would power them off/on in peoples shops or arcades when they werent going to notice just to see them boot up hoping to get a hint of what kind of computer was running it
  you were in vegas but didnt go to the pinball hall of fame
  ever mess anything up
  high scores
  it was alright    the teenagers would sit close to the arcades and drink they were the party kind of teenagers rather than the troubled ones so people wouldnt mind seeing them with a beer or two    little kids were cunts because they didnt understand the autistic unwritten rules of not being a cunt by that i mean they would use cheap tricks in fighting games like using the obviuosly broken character and spam moves in fighting games
some of my earlier memories involve my dad giving me some money and asking me i if want to rent a vhs buy candy or go to the arcades it was something you would do every x time like going to the cinema or playing a sport with your friends
would occasionally get some older gay pedos trying to pick me up at the arcade
  90s were a golden time for arcades too friend  80s arcades were different from 90s arcades          teen smoking drinking drugs sex all that kind of stuff happened at arcades in the 80s and had pretty much been pushed to private parties by the 90s       my dad taking me to the mall on sunday afternoons and giving me a few bucks to do whatever i wanted was one of my first tastes of unsupervised freedom and the arcade was at its relative safest
i mostly remember arcades from the early 90s there were a few in our town  we had a proper arcade where bigger kids would hang out and take speed a small one with maybe 20 cabinets mostly neo geo games above the comic book store the local laser tag that was the first place in town to get mortal kombat and super sfii and also the local bowling alley and cinema had a few cabinets there was an independent game store that got virtua fighter that was a pretty wow moment when we first saw that
  bigger kids would hang out and take speed  people took drugs in arcades there were no drugs in my country until the late 90s so i never saw that
  what was the average experience like    youd go in play a game and leave people would usually either go to the arcades after school or after work and spend as little as a few minutes in then staying at an arcade for hours was rare unless you were a kid and it was a weekend and you had nothing else to do all day most games were singleplayer then so you might have a few people watching you play depending on the area the whole thing of random people walking up and joining in a game was more of a 90s thing when suddenly every game became multiplayer    what kind of people were in attendance    very random mix of young adults and teens i guess like 1618 or so up through like early or mid 20s people over 30 seemed to be rare unless they were taking their kids there now at any dedicated arcade 2530 is like the starting age lol it was basically just average people going to the arcades every few weeks or even once a week for a brief period was a fairly common activity back then depending on where you lived how close by an arcade was and how stocked the arcade was and what kind of environment it was there werent really gamers back then and the few that might have fit that description were mostly pc gamers that didnt get out much lol so they never really showed up at the arcades or anywhere else aside from conventions or hobby shops except for maybe rarely there were also females females disappeared from arcades in the 90s    then there was the criminal element arcades in the 80s were kind of notorious for drugs though this was more of an issue in neighborhoods that were just shitty in general not so much of a problem in the suburbs in the 90s the crime problem was way worse though some inner city arcades practically got taken over by gangs in the 90s they used to love the fighting games especially for whatever reason
  as successful as the arcade business was in the early 90s it was completely different from the early 80s both in terms of the level of success and in terms of the overall environment of the arcades themselves very different experience going to an arcade in 1982 vs 1992      ever get a free game out of resetting or messing with the machine      this depended on where you were at in a lot of places people hated the people that complained about cheap tactics in fighting games more than they did the people that used cheap tactics hood arcades though you could irl get beat up if you pissed people off in a fighting game      thats fucked i never heard of pedos at arcades before      sex    i sure as fuck dont remember anyone fucking in an arcade
  yeah teens would just congregate around the pool table and smoke and dab at speed wraps it was just a place off the streets to hang out with little to no adult supervision
  there were no drugs in my country until the late 90s    what the fuck country is this
  it was just a place off the streets to hang out with little to no adult supervision    fucking this the biggest thing that people dont realize about arcades back in the day is that they were hangouts they had video games because that was something fun to do while you were hanging out same reason the ninja hideout in tmnt had arcade games in it lol
  awesome      so you never went to an arcade in the 80s just heard stories your crazy religious freak of a neighbor told your mom cool story      larping this hard
  do arcade games have a place in modern society    no im afraid its all cell phone games and microtransactions i wish they had a place but lets be honest how many people would even feel comfortable going into a place with other people and trying to socialize youd have to serve alcohol and probably ecstacy just to get people to open up like they did freely back then    id love to have seen pic related back in the day google timeout arcade
this needs to be an old arcade photos thread plus that would answer ops question better than us just telling him about it could
  do arcade games have a place in modern society  theyve never been stronger since some time in the late 90s/early 00s pretty much every major city has some kind of barcade now which sounds cliche as fuck but theyre generally all run and patronized by older people early 30s and up who have an appreciation for the machines id almost argue japans scene is a little worse because they can still smoke at the cabs and theyre almost all nesicaxlive machines running the same 2530 games even in the little mom n pop neighborhood places
  i remember asking about the arcade experience back on /vr/ around the time /vr/ was new and some anons said that the bishop of battle segment of nightmares that shows the arcade culture was accurate
  dude wtf are you talking about i dont know what shitty arcades youve been to but this wasnt the norm    pretty much been pushed to private parties by the 90s  lol just no there were still arcades in malls hotels movie theaters bowling alleys fucking boats well into the mid 90s are you just talking out of your ass or what do you know how many times my mom dropped me off in arcades while she went shopping between the late 80s and mid 90s i might of gotten slightly bullied a few times but youre just straight up making things up ive ignored you for so long cause youre seriously the most annoying tripfag since toxic jester and lanced jack but this post takes the fucking cake
  maybe you should just continue ignoring me since your reading comprehension is atrocious how could you possibly think i was saying there werent arcades in the 90s there are still two arcades in my small ass city right now nobody is mugging kids or selling weed out of them though thats for sure
  how do you want me to interrupt that shit sentence you constructed because 80s arcades were still around in the mid 90s thats what youre retarded ass is saying right that 80s arcades were pushed to private parties but magical 90s arcades were different youre fucking stupid dude
  well technically everything 80s stopped existing as of january 1st 1990 but i think its pretty obvious that i was talking about the teen smoking drinking drugs and sex im sorry for presuming you are as literate as a 2nd to 4th grader and capable of parsing compound sentences
  ever get a free game out of resetting or messing with the machine  not him but there was a pump it up machine korean ddr at an arcade called kahunaville there was a small hole about the size of a normal domino you could fit your two fingers inside and do a come hither motion and graze the switch for credits
i grew up in eden prairie mn our mall was the one used to film the movie mall rats     they had an arcade down by the food court it was great spent hours playing tmnt 2 and the simpsons 4 player games parents gave me 1000 which lasted all day and i was able to then get food as well everyone was happy there it was over 20 years ago but i remember it as some of the best times of my life
  ever get a free game out of resetting or messing with the machine  different anon here the track  field cabinet at a restaurant called mamas pizza in my home town would give one free game when turned on so we would pull the cord and plug it back in eventually the staff made us stop doing that
  missed this one janny guess youve got a problem with the discussion of adolescent sexuality  on 4chan incredible     anyway the reason my perception of 80s arcades vs 90s arcades may be especially delineated is because in the 80s my mall arcade was a gold mine like pic related it was simply lit by yellow faux gaslamps with false beams piles of gold and a freaking mine cart combining with various cockpit cabs to creating all kinds of dark nooks and corners evidencing foul activities    maybe it just coincidentally crossed the filth threshold but in 1990 it closed and the same machines immediately materialized in a tilt that was 3x the size brightly lit plus neon and a wide open facade totally family friendly    so yeah to me theres a very big clear difference between an 80s arcade and a 90s one
  the whole thing of random people walking up and joining in a game was more of a 90s thing when suddenly every game became multiplayer  dont shoot food
  i sure as fuck dont remember anyone fucking in an arcade  never touch anything in a photo booth
  yup everything that existed what made whatever in the 80s immediately disappeared january 1st 1990 thats totally not the most bat shit crazy claim youve ever made
  this reminds me of an old psa about pedos/homos and it mentioned how they liked to stalk boys at arcades and game shops so it was a legit threat
  wait waaaat i remember hearing that there used to be psas in the 50s but in the 80s
  most likely behind the iron curtain russia started to get massive drug problems once its borders were open and people had more money to spend
  agreed
  now i know youre a dumb kid but psas havent stopped being produced hell in the 80s alone we had them embedded into cartoons now you get them in your shitty youtube channels stop acting the fool
  i was born in 89 so i didnt really get to experience the true arcade experience  88 here same shit i remember going to maybe one or two arcades in my childhood one i would later learn struggling  slowly dying one and another one in an amusement park i think i wouldve loved it though the little tastes i got to have are cherished memories  apparently they tended to be pretty sketchy though my dad had a lot of shady friends and according to one there wasnt a better place to deal in drugs or prostitutes his words not mine just in case one of you rainmen is already typing up a storm
  what do you think all those a very special episode were
    i meant psas warning about fags
  very random mix of young adults and teens i guess like 1618 or so up through like early or mid 20s    meant to say very random mix of young adults and teens i guess like 1618 or so up through like early or mid 20s and little kids mostly preteens fucking forgot that last part but thats really essential if you want to understand what the arcade audience actually was like
  i was born in 89 and spent most of my formative years in arcades with my dad where the fuck did you grow up where there were no arcades in the 90s
  hm i wonder what all the 1315 year olds were doing
  you know very well that they meant that most arcade goers were either young adults or little kids stop being retarded on purpose
  i think preteens pretty specifically refers to 1012 year olds and he further specified 1618 year olds and young adults
this probably gets brought up often but round1 isnt too shitty its mostly music games and ticket machines with a couple of shitty mobile games and japanese arena games theres a fighting game section too but its deserted since people just play those at home a lot of families go there asian teenagers and young adults go usually to play one of the dancing games i go there to play ddr its almost always busy and its the only real arcade anyone goes to here so id say theres a place for them
  i honestly wish i had a round1 near me the fact that their taito stuff nesica groove coaster etc is actually online is really appealing to me
the actual games were fine but the monetisation was horrendous fuck arcades also fuck the arcade community on /shmupg/ the self proclaimed bastions of retro games they constantly pretend to know about games even though its clear they dont and they dont even play the games they talk about
  preteen is a word pedophiles use when talking about their preferences no one who isnt a creeper uses that word please dont use it the word you are looking for is child
  this is excellent bait
  dont name drop them they know they dont play the games its all about shitposting about deathsmiles and twitter/forum posts
  not true there were already a lot of drugs in eastern europe in the 80s it just wasnt as big as it became during the 90s and it was kind of hidden from public view by the communist governments even though the people knew what was going on
  the monetisation was horrendous    what in the fuck are you talking about
  t never went to an arcade
  i was born in 89    get the fuck out of here you are underage
  this god i wish i could explain it theres just no way to translate my memories into an adequately descriptive 4chan posts video arcades in the 80s were like pure magic it was like stepping into a realm of pure imagination it was the future and it was your future
  stepping foot into an 80s arcade for the first time was about as wondrous of an experience as stepping into an alien spacecraft the technology seemed so advanced at the time that it was like the arcade machines were brought to earth by an advanced alien life form imagine being beemed up to the star trek enterprise and experiencing the holodeck for the first time it was like that for me going to the arcade when i was 8 years old it felt like heaven i never wanted to leave
  hhot
  every single bit of flashing light and sound was a new experience waiting to be explored imagine if you can young lurkers in this thread what it would be like to see video games for the time when nothing like them had ever existed in your universe when you had no basis of comparison to judge them against each other because each new game was a completely novel experience with the creators taking part in the adventure just as much as the players we played them just for the sheer joy of seeing what would happen next what combination of gleaming colors would sear onto our eyeballs to simulate aliens and giant bugs and wizards and psychedelic mushrooms imagine the sheer excitement and mystery of telling your friends you once saw a slightly different tiny pixel shape appear once rarely and the urban legends that would spring up around trying to reproduce it all of this taking place in a secret world just for your generation a science fiction fantasy universe only you had a portal to
camping once  wandering through woods  find little public shelter on edge of campground with electricity  no one else around for miles  theres nothing inside but a picnic table and a working galaga machine  one of my favorite childhood memories so comfy
  they werent so great
    fucking glorious like casinos for kids and adults
    if you go to japan you can still experience arcade culture they have multilevel arcades scattered all over tokyo filled with every hit and sleeper hit of the past 30 years all kept in perfect condition lots are yakuza owned and at times thick with cigarette smoke    but sadly the blacklight style glow in the dark arcades are strictly an american thing we probably wont see those ever again i was lucky when a very authentic retro arcade opened in my town a couple years back but sadly despite my patronage it closed down
  90s arcades were just hords of niggers hanging around street fighter/mortal kombat with the rest of the games empty
    thankfully i lived in mostly white areas the majority of my life    little shitty city mutts and nogs purposely break arcade cabinets out of spite
  nearest round1 is about 3 hours away from me honestly considering it someday i drove much further than that for ddr tourneys back then
  it sure is raining here
  you wanna know what arcades were like nothing like this thread people were pretty cool to each other even if we did smack talk one another it was a place we could meet new people play some games and trade tips  secrets
  using guiles cuffs on some dbag was pure gold
  do arcade games have a place in modern society  yes they have of course since the times have changed arcades scene nowadays isnt the same like it used to be from the 90s and before arcades today are mostly casual appealing with most of them being light gun shooters racing games arcade ports of popular smartphone games vr cabinets and so on and you mostly meet them at the malls    things are different in japan because of japanese culture
  reminds me this experience of mine from mid 90s  me and my family going to a small mountain village  my mother is relieved because she thought we wouldnt see any arcades there  there was a tavern that had two arcade cabinets one with street fighter 2 and one with tehkan world cup   my mother was like not here too  so priceless even if we didnt played with them since there were more modern games back then in arcades
  vr    vr is a pipedream and theres nothing you can do about it
  did you ever see the original tmnt the part with the foot clans hideout and all the kids were smoking and drinking and doing bad shit what do you think that was based on
  what about the bishop of battle segment of nightmares
  patrician
so i was a lad in the 80s and an adolescent in the 90s and an arcade freak   80s  i was kind of young so i dont remember everything but this was more of the late 80s not the booming pacman years though you could still find a few games in a pizza shop or a decent amount in the bowling alley the stand alone arcades were drab and dark granted i lived in a shit town but it was rather seedy our arcade had about 1314 games in it i specifically remember crystal castlesshinobistar wars mighty bomb jack and staple games like pac man and galaga among many more the front of the store acted as a candy shop there would be mostly kids in there and some weirdos too this is in stark contrast to the 90s  90s   there was another boom period mainly due so street fighter 2 anyone who was around at the time knows whats up that game was fucking everywhere arcadespizza shopsmarkets even random delis would have a machine in there i also noticed the arcades opening up more the games were multiplayer and the arcades themselves actually used bright lighting as opposed to that drab shit they also had game sections im just guessing for every ones little sisters cause that what mine did ball pits whack a mole skee ball and the like the big arcade had about 4 street fighter games with lines going out the door once mortal kombat came out these places were absolutley packed to the rafters most kids were playing these games for bragging rights alot of shit talking but nothing too serious youd even make friends waiting on line to play or randomly playing another game i remember bumping into some other wrestlefag while playing wrestlefest we were best friends that day remember thosethe fad died down eventually but i remember there being remnants of arcades into the early 00s 04 being my last memory of seeing one
im from a city in spain and back then middle to late 80s 90s i think i only saw once a big arcade decorated as such in all my life usually machines were at bars where it caused the strange picture of groups of kids and early teenagers around drunken adults or old people having coffe and reading the newspapers  arcade places where usually dirty dark and full of cigarette smoke but you didnt care because it was amazing seeing and playing those games you could never have at home    thats a major problem arcades have today the have lost the awe effect that had in the 80s and early 90s when people was playing black and white games or 16 colors at home in a small screens you could go to the arcade and literally have your head explode watching outrun power drift strider dragons lair etc     when people bash tmnt or the simpsons game by konami you have to remember that in those days it was like seeing alive the characters of the tv shows an being able to control them you couldnt have at home such colorful and amazing games at home let alone playing 4 players at the same time
  arcades were always mostly only big in america and japan
  ive never been to an arcade but i read some things on the internet  cool story kid there were plenty of other places where arcades were big
  im from a city in spain    arcades were always mostly only big in america and japan  he hasnt even heard of gaelco
  dont talk to me
i was born in 81 on the east coast the first arcades i remember was the tmnt arcade in the front of a supermarket chain iga when i was much younger a golden axe arcade in the local deli and the superman arcade game was in the ground round a family restaurant    the local mall had random arcades scattered through it not many i remember one being narc and another being street fighter ii champion edition    the local roller skating place had a shitton and i loved going there for friends birthdays they had games like road blasters rampage dragons lair after burner the sitdown one  paper boy aliens root beer tapper xmen simpsons both tmnt games pacmania jail break all kinds of shit most of the hits from any good mame set these days    it had a magic about it i guess you gave a fuck about credits because you only got like 10 in tokens to spend but you also wanted to win some weird shit from the prize counter so you had to balance between arcades and skeeball the moles hammer game smash the crocodile heads with the mallet game or the giant ticketwheel thing    i always liked it because you would make a friend for the day just playing through games together if you were both good or if one of you was a quick learner
  the ameridumb everyone to him only america and japan are real countries to hell with the rest dragons and wyverns i tells ya
  thunder hoop yo
  holy shotwith emilio estevez right brings me back
  ayy payo dame cinco duros
  kind of ironic they still exist and run strong despite them being much less outgoing and a bajillion times more addicted to smartphone games
  amerifat or not hes right like im sure there were arcades in south america in the 80s or in the soviet union but i think one can be forgiven for not knowing about these small markets and their collective culture america and japan likely represented 90 of coinop revenue from the 70s to the 90s    what was up in spain or thailand back then likely nothing playing bootleg games or second hand units maybe rows of famicom clones that youd pay a few coins to play for 15 minutes in a sweltering hot steel shed on the edge of a slum curse those americans for not knowing our culture
  spain had a quite strong arcade culture and as someone has said above they had companies like galeco which are famous worldwide with titles like thunder hoop word rally or radikal bikers they also had such and advance protection scheme than until recently the mame team couldnt emulate those games even cps2 was easier to crack    its not a third world country and by the early 90s the new park series of arcade centers offered a lot of big hitech games games like the r360 cabinet virtua formula the ridge racer cabinet with the real mazda plenty of datyona usa games etc you could play all thsoe games in all the big cities in spain
i wanted to join the thread but reading through it it seems everyone elses experiences with 80s arcades in their respective countries is nearly identical to my experiences with arcades in 1980s italy  unless you were in a resort town the arcade itself was a scary place for little kids and i was certainly a little kid in the 80s thankfully arcade games were everyfuckingwhere back then the dry goods store the green grocer the ice cream shop the neighbourhood café/bar and the laundry all had several machines ffs in my town even the furniture store had a pair of machines the owner would put outside every morning shed unplug them every night to take them in thereby deleting the high scores but most people didnt care too much
  i was born in 77 so i remember it all pretty well they varied a lot depending on where they were located an arcade in a strip mall could be very different from an arcade at a amusement park or restaurant what kind of people went to them if you were alive in the 80s you went to them at least occasionally i loved the places but after the nes came out they began to decline slowly but the nes still didnt have the computing power of a arcade cabinet and computer games of the time were complete trash
  galeco  kek the off brand version of jaleco
    78 family owned a arcade from 8092 i practically grew up in one missed the days of pizza the background noise but what sticks out is the smell of electronics
in the 90s it was the first time seeing a 3d game running at 60 fps which my pc at home ran games at about 20 by about 1998 home games had more progression such as in gran turismo which made people turn away from the arcade by 2000 the arcades were mostly still using games from 1995 and were pathetic compared to before
itt people who werent there and dont know make wild guesses
  i live in finland and arcades were rare but there was one big one here that we used to go to it had some amazing games and it felt like going to a carnival basically they also had a gokart circle there which was so cool but too expensive for my poor family to go on we used to hang out in the place play games and admire them but being from poor backgrounds we didnt get to play much so as little kids we would often just watch others play eat our candy and then leave i still remember the day the place closed down i was a teenager and i saw the place just empty fucking hit me hard never seen an arcade anywhere since im 30 now and that arcade closed like 15 years ago i feel like my life is over already i wish i could go back to those days of being 15 and playing video games without any feel of guilty just play endlessly and let the days go by now i play too much i feel guilty but then again im still neet and i let game ruin my damn life i dont feel too well anymore i wish i had money so i could buy a house or even rent a home for a year and continue neeting but times are getting rough parent probably dying soon then ill be alone with my dysfunctional brothers who are both also neet losers like me but im the more emotionally prepared one since i think about her death all the time and that it is coming i tried convincing my brother to get a job but he isnt listening i think hes at a brink of full on depression second brother is an alcoholic and 10 years older than me so he has given up long ago he gets benefits i dont mainly because if i go and report myself as unemployed and get benefits they might cut my mothers benefits she doesnt want that so here i sit wasting away making a few bucks online god i wonder when ill kill myself
  mk was far bigger youre being a hipster
  in 93 we had doom on pc everything after that for arcade or console is irrelevant it started the disparity between arcade/console and pc we still have 25 years later    furthering the point pc had 7090hz gaming in the mid 90s also resolutions in games and os as high as 2304 x 1440 with most crts averaging between 720p and 1080p
  it was a good time arcade i went to in the 80s was in a mall me and my friends would hang out there all day eat in the food court watch movies at the theater play defender and berzerk when they got a gauntlet machine and all four of us could play at once that was the shit the real tragedy of today isnt just the loss of arcades it was the loss of malls malls were fucking amazing back then and they were everywhere americans just got too fat to walk any more so they werent popular and shut down
  malls were fucking amazing back then and they were everywhere    i still remember the pink neon and aqua colors so popular in malls at the time we didnt have anything this fancy in small town iowa but i love this video 
  fellow iowabro whats good hope youre staying warm this weather went cold quick    i was born in 88 and its both cool and sad to read the stories about arcades since i kinda missed out on the 80s and a lot of the 90s scene    i kinda vaguely remember the early to mid 90s arcade stuff as my dad liked to take me to one while at the mall on occasion it seemed like a pretty hopping place most of the time as there would be people always hovering around the mk and some of the beat em up machines as well as the shooter ones    for being in the middle of nowhere iowa our mall arcade had some pretty decent games during the early 2000s i vividly remember spending a lot of money on post/vr/ games like soul calibur 2 initial d tekken 34 mvc2 project justice and so on i got to talk to and meet a lot of different people i otherwise wouldnt have interacted with face to face they were good memories and i still think about them from time to time    just the other day had a dream about this cute girl that came in to play me in sc2 that would play as talim every time    i kinda regret not talking to her
  i got a round1 in my area 2 years ago i go there once every two weeks or so with some of my friends its got a good amount of music and fighting games like you said but half of the place is just dave and busters tier stuff and claw games for anime plushes mines has a good amount of racing and figthing games and the oldest rhythm game is a taiko game from 2010
  youre delusional if you think the arcade business was ever significantly large in any way in any country other than america or japan
  it was relatively big in central and south america problem is they mostly bought bootlegs
    well an actual dedicated arcade outside of a major population center was still somewhat rare until about 85 in the us instead you just had arcade games supplement other kinds of games mostly pinball and pool tables in other places like food joints bars especially but also places where people mightve had some excess time despite being there    places like movie theatres or public laundry machines private transit like bus stations larger college commissaries roller rinksthey had up to 5 machines tucked into a corner somwhere i remember seeing a yie ar kung fu in a kroger at those ages    chuck e cheese/showbiz pizza is probably one of the first dedicated arcade/family centers that reached various suburbs across na that or minigolf or gokart parks    i guess what it was like will depend on what your neighborhood was like because it still largely an extension of your community that was hanging around at the time
  anon that is the wrong type of arcade
  i always went to the skating rink that had a huge arcade you could hang out there for hours skating and spending time in the arcade if someone didnt want to do arcade stuff they could go chase after girls i never did the mall scene much tho
  doom was outdated as soon as the ps1 was released ridge racer had the 3d look while doom with its ray casting looked artificial then you had daytona which took ages to match on pc maybe nfs 3 with 3dfx
  you know daytona had a pc release
    arcades were awesome and i miss them to a certain degree if only because it was a part of my youth    it was like being in a club your parents would drop you off youd see who was there play a game talk to your friends play another game talk more with your friends    depending upon the arcade youd either eat there or eat nearby there was one rollerskating rink that we regarded as an arcade because they had so many of them and so youd rollerskate then play some games then go back to rollerskating then eat then rollerskate meanwhile your parents would be doing whatever in town or at home and theyd pick you up after six or so hours    the rise of consoles in the midtolate 80s began spelling the doom for arcades they first disappeared in the normal stores a lot of stores would have one / two arcade machines to keep the kids busy while mom shopped and then the arcades themselves began to close even before then a lot of the normal arcade machines left and were replaced with the shooting or sitdown ones nonjoystick machines that couldnt easily be replicated by a console
    no offense but we had two dedicated arcades in our town and we were hardly a major population center    will agree that a lot of stores had an arcade machine or two and that places such as rollerskating rinks  movie theaters especially multiscreens were treated as arcades for the  of machines that they had
  japanese arcades do fine hipster arcade bars in the us are a big thing now
  doom was outdated as soon as the ps1 was released  not really early 3d lacked a lot of the detail that 2d sprites in a raycasting engine had id say it took all the way till 1997 before you really saw 3d engines that started to surpass there is a reason why raycasting in games existed in parallel with true 3d for a while
  arcades were still relatively popular in my town during the early 00s most of them were bootleg cabinets with hundreds of games installed though
  i want to hate on the hipster barcade thing but at least theyre actually collecting restoring and taking care of these old cabinets instead of just letting them get tossed into the trash
  wtf i was born in 90 and got to play hella arcade games    collectors of any type are good cause they keep games from getting trashed no joke theres people who collect fucking crt tvs
  the rise of consoles in the midtolate 80s began spelling the doom for arcades    they did fine during the atari 2600 era it was more likely the rising crime rate rising taxes rising utility cost etc just made the business less profitable

ticket value inflation wasnt so bad
    is just moores law eventually an arcade machine that cost 50x as much as a playstation for an experience barely 50 better didnt earn enough tokens to pay for itself let alone keep the wolves from the door
  nah hes fine arcades were big many places not sure if youre just delusional or also underage and retarded
  you might be the dumbest person on this board congrats
    both of these posters are underage
  i finally had the realization hit when i went to put a coin into a marvel vs capcom machine and thought why am i doing this i have this at home    up to that point yeah home consoles were eating into the arcades market share but you still understood that the home version wasnt quite the same there was always some little advantage that made the arcade worth the coins but at that moment i felt like that time had ended  the only thing arcades could do to compete was getting more of the big gimmick machines     the last hold out ive seen around here these days is the walmart keeping that batman batmobile arcade machine for years before swapping it out for some snowmobile thing
  yeah i live in japan and arcades are fucking everywhere here good date spot great place to drink some beers and play mario kart and street fighter with your mates   my favorite game was bingo party pirates me and two buddies would sit down with a case of beer and a pack of cigs and play that shit for hours
  they would use cheap tricks in fighting games like using the obviuosly broken character and spam moves in fighting games  scrub
  arcades crashed in like 1994 so the le playstation killed arcades xd meme doesnt work
  dude wtf are you talking about i dont know what shitty arcades youve been to but this wasnt the norm  arcades here in canadaland were shady as fuck in the 1980s there were always people who sell pot and pull alcohol for kids in every arcade and it didnt matter if it was in the good part of town or in a shithole beside the bus depot downtown they had a very shady clientele outside the arcade there would be the kids trying to sell you stolen bikes their recently shoplifted gains    in the early 1990s a lot of communities called for arcades to be shut down due to the heavy gang presence newspapers published warnings about the big arcades in places like west edmonton mall where teen girls were being lured by pimps     but fuck were they ever a great time even with all the indians
  dragons lair out of order  fuck that was a common sight the old laserdisc player was always broken
    id have gone to more arcades as a teenager for the sheer novelty of it but the nintendo wii satisfies most of the need for peripheral satisfaction and i bet vr does much of the same    dave and busters is pretty cool i walked into it once its nice to see them use relatively modern tech in the early 00s most arcades looked nowhere near as good as what gamecube and ps2 were doing
  maybe if i call people underage they wont notice how retarded i am  nah it actually draws attention to you and suggests youre underage
  late 90/very early 2000s  the n64/psx era  goin to costco in mah country  either playin n64 with goldeneye or cruisn usa  or playin ki on snes in a giant projection screen  or playing psx sampler disc 7 and playing tomba or einheinder    memories
  29  underage    bet you hes older than average on this board    t born in 1996
  3 years after the arcade games release and if i remember correctly it was based on the saturn port so had much worse graphics than the arcade version
    i doubt that most people on this board are late 20searly 30s
  lol the delusion
    itll get better anon but only if you take the first step try to move to your own flat and youll get your own benefits and gov will pay up some of your rent then apply as unemployed and theyll get you rehibilitation to get you back on your feet and finding a job    i know its normie shit but i was this close of becoming an eternal neet but i managed to save myself from becoming fulltime sad shitposter now i live on my own work and get money for vidya
i wish i couldve gone to an arcade in their heyday i only got to play outrun at a highway restaurant once my parents had to physically drag me away from it
    i spend a lot of time on this board and i wouldnt even speculate on the relative age demographics there are definitely some people quite a bit older than i but there are also a lot of very young people too who are unfortunately met with such anger they pretend to be older which leads to the kind of im not underage youre underage bickering where a 19 year old will claim that 29 is too young to post here as counterintuitive as that sounds i have no doubt it happens with great regularity
  my parents had to physically drag me away from it    nigga how old were you
  5 or maybe 6 years old the only videogames i had seen before were nes games at the neighbors house
  lol
     not only in the big cities in spain in the 80s and 90s every tapas bar or cafe had an arcade cab im from a city with a population of barely 130000 and we had 5 different arcades with lots of machines billards and ping pong tables i played tons of arcades time crisis 1 and 2  the jurassic park lightgun game all the house of the dead even the one with the shotguns ninja assault every tekken street fighter denjin makai megaman power battles almost every neogeo cps1 and 2 game we had even japanesse games untranslated was fun gathering with the usuals and talk about games and exchange console games i miss those days now everyone of these is something like pic related
this thread smells like larping
anybody know of a good arcade near minneapolis all i can find are gay barcades
  its sad that relatively mundane human experience is unbelievable to you  and youre probably not even reading the unpruned version of the thread on the archive
  truthfully they were free daycares for parents give your kid 5 bucks and give or take your skill you could spend 56 hours or blow it in minutes    also  pedophiles  few incidents of grown men and 1 woman caught in my city trying to solicit kids
  well of course you wouldnt
  anybody ever seen this movie
  they used to love the fighting games especially for whatever reason  unironically maybe they could relate to them more
born in 85 first arcade game i remember was xmen also remember playing a shitload of games at the bowling alley or skating rink damn it was a lot better growing up then than now
  there also wasnt such a thing as murder or rape in the soviet union
  leif green  jim greenleaf  potthemed pseudonyms
heres a good example      best to start around 1115 if 4chan doesnt accept time codes
  yes its kind of shitty but im a sucker for joe don baker also the guy on the poster looks like a shorter fatter joe don baker and he just fucks with him the whole movie
  theres like 10 arcades in and around denver
  yeah its a slutty shit movie there are arcade games in it though even the incredibly rare streaking
  wait thats real
  how dare someone make money off screaming kids and stoners
        looks like its set up in someones basement
  reddit weirdo      duh blacks and mexicans all love fighting games and they also commit most drug crime and crime in general
  oh yes
  fighting game players commited more crimes  wow wonder why
  it does yeah i wonder if that was some bars back room or something
  someone give the sim girl in red pants new orders she isnt doing anything
  theyre the only reason for me to get out nowadays besides watching movies alone in a vip cinema its mostly just music and racing games these days though
its unrelated but i feel like soon this is what people will say about movie theaters
going to hijack this on good grounds in case you like anime then go a watch highscore girl it is totally worth it for the arcade comfy feeling alone great watch right on the subject imho
  the animations not great but its a pretty solid show  hopefully someone will start translating the manga again
  looks like the old delta attraction in magic kingdom at disneyworld
  i dont think thats it

  teh ironing
  theres a number of arcades still active where i live granted this is the uk so im not sure if this applies to the us or not  1 theyre a lot smaller than you think dont expect an entire warehouse full of machines unless its a literal arcade museum like the op pic  2 expect a lot of older stuff from the 50s and 60s coin drops crane games that sort of shit theyre the reason your grandmother keeps a giant jar full of coins  3 now this one is definitely only a uk thing fucking fruit machines theyre like the british pachinko and theyre everywhere  4 dont expect a huge amount of activity around proper game cabinets lightgun games are king followed by rhythm games then racing cockpits arcades are 999 about novelty  5 screen burn in if youre expecting amazing crt image quality prepare to be disappointed  6 ticket machines are great fun especially when they spit out a comical amount of tickets  7 they were expensive and were the haunts of rich kids they still are expensive probably worse now as new machines cost 2 a credit fucking terminator salvation  8 if you had food or drink you finished it outside the arcade they could still stink of sweat but it wasnt that bad  9 same goes for smoking im sure there were some seedier arcades out there but arcades were places for kids first and foremost  10 i never envied the attendants theyre not cool nerd types who lean on the machines giving tips or setting machines on freeplay so they could get some practice in theyre just random retail workers who spend their time either counting tickets or cleaning up puke not a fun job    all in all i still think they have a place in modern society my local arcade still gets new machines even if theyre arcade ports of mobile games these days i wouldnt go there often myself but they still make great places for a date or a night out with mates when youre bored of pubs fuck the fruit machines though
ywn play mario kart vr   cant believe this shit only exists in like 3 video arcades in japan
    who else had an aladdins castle i just found out this was a chain and not just a local place

  thats classic nintendo have something that will be a wild success everywhere and then sit on it and do nothing or severely limit supply for no real reason at all
  nintendo is so set in doing things a specific way all the time that theyve become totally inflexible to the point of regularly missing huge opportunities for profit
  yeah its like a time capsule bad 80s movie thats still fun to watch it would never pass in todays world but its kind of hilarious how common showing boob was in a rated r movie back then
  they really are im amazed at the opportunities they pass up to do the same old formula maybe they are scared to branch out too much after seeing what happened to their competition
  plenty of stuff to do downtown like smoking weed and getting drunk probably why they work out so well
  arcade culture lives lol
  i was that kid     now that im older i will bust your old ass up
  are you retarded anon said the sex/drugs/rager lifestyle had been pushed to private parties by the 90s anon did not say arcades were pushed out next time you plan on writing a block full of stupidity go back and read again
  denim everything    thats one of those things with 0 chance of ever coming back in
  blow your entire quarter jar in one night at the arcade  thats how it helps if youre a good player but i always lost so i had to put in quarters to play again just      anyone know of good arcades where lots of people go nowadays
  i bet they had some cool videogames at their house you shoulda gone with em
  why would you want to hate on barcades  other than the name being gay its literally a fucking arcade with the only difference being you can buy drinks i dont get the hate  the one where i live is 5 to get in and all the games are free and they are constantly collecting new machines with some being almost 40 years old but still working its fucking great man they have some super old nintendo machines that have og mario bros shit i saw a 50 year old or so japanese dude at one showing all these old games to his little kid warmed my heart it was fucking great
  we had one i was born in 83 and we had the old shitty mall in the shitty part of town that had an aladdins castle and the newer mall that had a time out i think the ac was a holdover from the seedy 80s arcade era because it was older had older machines and was smokey and really dark i actually was kind of scary going there as a kid i seem to remember all the decor was pink for some reason you always had a vague feeling that you might get abducted/mugged/raped there   the time out was great though a lot of great childhood memories there total opposite of aladdins castle it was brightly lit with a more normal decor and you couldnt smoke in there and they always had the latest games
  its literally a fucking arcade    no its a bar it used to be the norm for bars to have arcade and/or pinball machines this isnt bringing arcades back its bringing old school bars back
   you  s literally a fucking arcade    no its a bar it used to be the norm for bars to have arcade and/or pinball machines this isnt bringing arcades back its bringing old school bars back  bullshit i was around in the 90s and i never saw a bar with more than a few games the local barcade has dozens and no tables to sit down at just a bar and games everywhere  are you really so offended by people around you drinking that you have to act like its a bad concept
    little kids were cunts  mostly because none of them had money and whenever you just wanted to play a round of metal slug some little faggot would go can i be player 2 and then theyd put their fucking hands on the player 2 stick and youd have to break your attention away from the game to make sure theyre not pressing the start button   and you couldnt even kick the little shits
  op dont even get me started from my freshmen year of highschool to my junior year of college me and my greasy headbanger friends would go out every fucking weekend and hit up that mile and a half stretch of sunset boulevard there were arcades everywhere i grew up in ohio before my parents moved to la and my only experience with vidya was the nes it had some cool games when i went cruzing and boozing with my friends and we went to the place a block away from the whiskey and i saw outrun for the first time i was blown the fuck away arcades were the shit underage drinking burnt out stoners headbangers nerdy kids a thick cloud of cigarette smoke cruzing from arcade to arcade rock club to rock club parking lot parties fuck dude you could pick up bitches in the cruse scene man   op i sincerely wish you could experience arcades just like we old fucks did back in the day by the time grunge the playstation and the n64 came around arcades where i lived were dead there were still some downtown that had good games but the culture i fell in love with wasnt there
if you get a chance try going to something like california extreme its a convention with hundreds of arcade and pinball machines and its busy enough that you can get a bit of an idea of what arcades were like once upon a time
  i was around in the 90s and i never saw a bar with more than a few games    he thinks they were talking about the 90s
  i was around in the 90s and i never saw a bar with more than a few games    no one said they ever had more than a few just that bars used to have arcade or pinball machines
  leather on leather was way cooler anyway
    source any info i wanna buy my gf those heels for christmas
    geez man buncha nerds just playin vidya in there how long did that scene last what years
    i mean about the 90s arcade culture what did it become did you phase out during the golden age and come back to see it changed without seeing the transition thats the hardest way to deal with time passing anon
are there any multistory arcades in america anymore i know there used to be one in like connecticut or wherever
    in 1991 street fighter ii basically saved arcade culture single handedly but then the whole 90s was pretty much all about fighting games consoles got good enuf then so in the 00s it was about attraction style games with fancy gimmicks that were too big and/or expensive to have at home but were expensive for operators too with all that overhead now in the 10s its more about nostalgia and/or getting back to basics      there used to be two in columbus a sega gameworks that closed and was resurrected by an investment vompany as something called kdb i think with stickers stuck over the sega logos now closed and silver ball on high street that building even has since been heavily converted into a theater
cold war era was pure sex space age technologyvideo gamesthe internet i still dont know a game that feature the m60a2 starship
  thats actually real    huh
i used to go to the arcade at the mall in the 80s i was still prehighschool i would wander the few hundred yards up the hill to the edge of the mall it was situated next door to a rowdy bar and a chipshop there was also a church on its doorstep but i will get back to that and wander in this dark place with a low neon glow that stank of beer pot and glue where shifty kids stood in dark corners smoking and playing fruit machines i would normally have a 1 maybe 2 on me which was my allowance in the 80s lol but the games were 10p a play i was eventually a regular face and being the kid was looked after by a few of the older rogues and dabbled in petty crime but anyway it had frogger pacman double dragon golden axe return of the jedi rushnattack operation wolf shinobi fantasy zone a space harrier ride on set up wwf so many classics i cant remember eventually things like mortal kombat appeared and the new wave of arcade cabinets around that time but it was never the same back to the church i was mentioning earlier outside the arcade once or twice a month there would be a wedding and the traditional scramble was thrown the arcade would empty minutes before this everybody would assume what they thought the best position was and it became a literal battle royal for loose change many hands were trodden on many skint knees and bust lips all for those elusive silver coins and more time in the arcade was sad to see it go eventually the bar next door bought the arcade and knocked it through as an extension to the bar and create a lounge area yer so that was me from like 7 years old
bumpity bump
  deluxe sitdown version with controls on the armrests like in the show  that game finally fucking makes sense now that i see this ive only ever seen it in a standup cabinet and in that configuration the warp button is off in the middle of the controls where its impossible to reach
  uhummwhen i was in late elementary school my teacher used to call us all preteens should i have been scared
  huh well shit i didnt even notice that until you pointed it out
  t larping zoomer
  chipshop    what the fuck is this
  ironically its a shop that sells you guessed it chips
  what the fuck are chips
  im that guy from that post    chips are like fries but they a lot thicker cut and they are the main accompanyment of meals called suppers these can range anywhere from traditional battered or breaded fish to a smoked sausage to a bloodsausage a mince or steak pie or even a haggis or a pizza with the aforementioned chips everything being deepfried occasionally an oven baked pizza of course they also sell a variety of icecreams and sodas and candy some sell cigarettes a lot of places now do a variety of other takeaway style foods like a doner kebab or even pakora
many chipshops especially in scotland are owned by italian immigrants/families of who came here during after the war
  how the fuck would i know im not a boomer i imagine they were basically dave and busters but with more cocaine
  by that i mean they would use cheap tricks in fighting games like using the obviuosly broken character and spam moves in fighting games    being this mad you were beat up by a kid
  sounds like what burgers call steak fries
  more old photos of people in arcades thats the best part of these threads
  this looks neat if i ever own an arcade id do this but every threshold would be a different year like going through a time machine
  theyre the things that go under the fried fish to soak up the grease and vinegar or the things you put in the middle of a butty
  that would be a long fucking entranceway
  just that bars used to have arcade or pinball machines  looking way back the very first pong machine was in a bar named  andy capps tavern they chose it because the bar already had a good variety of pinball machines and a computer space game    things didnt become kid friendly until the late 1970s/early 80s and even then the bars and pool halls still represented a big part of the arcade and especially pinball industry home consoles were for the kids the sketchy teens and drug dealers had their arcades and the adults had their bars bowling alleys and pool hall games
arcade machines in the home in the late 1970s and early 80s was also an ultimate symbol of wealth and luxury the whos who of celebrities had them and the tv show silver spoon was about a richie rich kid and his ad had a small collection of arcade machines because he had limitless wealth
  this was the first appearance of the home arcade
the best thing about arcades was going up to a machine like simpsons and having a bunch of kids you didnt know come up and join no one really said anything it was just kind of an understood brotherhoodtype thing didnt really matter who they were in that moment you became friends of a sort during certain parts of the game you might say something about the game but otherwise it was just you and 3 others plus some spectators maybe
  different strokes 1982 season also added an arcade set to the tv show it was the local arcade the kids hung out at there where whole epsidoes dedicated to arcade shootouts and other drama around arcades at the time
  season 5 was the peak of the arcade episodes
    the way gary coleman met his demise makes me sad
  rip my dude
  that actually sounds pretty fucking awesome
  the arcade wasnt always portrayed well in that show soemtimes it was friendly competition or just a place for the neighborhood kids to hang out other times issues like skipping school would tie into story lines there may have been an episode where a criminal or drug dealer confronted the kids an they did the responsible thing and told their parents its been yeas and i cant remember     so 50 comfy arcade 50 psa warning kids about dangers of arcades typical for an early 80s sitcom
  what the fuck is going on in that pic
  babbages is a child molester i happen to know this for a fact how can i report him i know it wouldnt be the first time on here
  i heard he fell down the stairs didnt realize it was the stairs to your rape dungeon you mistook him for a little boy or something
any good arcade documentaries
  niagara falls kahunaville
  fun fact women love it when you do that too
when i was growing up my parents used to take me and my sister camping in grand bend over the summers there used to be a little arcade there its title was actually arcade and they had the only virtualon cab ive ever seen i hold that game and consequently that place responsible for getting me into both arcades and mecha    unfortunately it closed sometime within the past decade and to my knowledge the building is still vacant
  cyber troopers  metal slug  cannon spike  sfii turbo  sfiii 3rd strike  children of the atom  mkiii  time crisis ii  marvel v capcom
  this holy shit some kid slapped start when i had loaded a machine up and completely fucked me over from then on i only loaded the games creditbycredit
bump
  yeah anyone who put multiple credit in at once was practically asking to get screwed over
  based and redpilled
  so the camp grounds are still there but they have some random empty building that no one uses
am i mistaken in my impression that retro arcade games even in akihabara are dying out
  crane games are their biggest business as you go up from floor to floor they become less and less busy when i was there in 2016 the gundam pod games were untocuhed and on a row of kancole arcade machines only one autist was playing the fake vlt poker machines and those coin pushers had more action than most of the arcade games did
born in 89 and from my experience it has been interesting to see how arcades dwindled out my mom worked at a skating rink when i was around 67 and my sister and i would sometimes preoccupy ourselves with whatever games they had then places like walmart and kmart had a small area with cabinets walmart having its own booth area near the front of the store while kmart was out in the open by the entrances most noteworthy game i can remember was a translated dbz fighter in a kmart    seemed like in this part of the us arcades took a massive dip or mostly disappearing between 20012015 there were still places like chuck e cheese but they started popping up again thanks to barcades one place has been open since 2015 and is now opening their third location so yeah i think arcades still have a place in society but it might just be another fad catering to young adults who knows
  then places like walmart and kmart had a small area with cabinets walmart having its own booth area near the front of the store while kmart was out in the open by the entrances most noteworthy game i can remember was a translated dbz fighter in a kmart    what in the fuck ive never seen arcade cabinets in walmart or kmart and i used to go to those places back in the 80s when arcade games were everywhere
  my walmart literally has a big game hunter cab in it right now its even part of a little arcade but literally every other thing is prize machines a basketball shooter and a ride on for kids guaranteed that shit makes more money too they used to have a cruisin world in there but it gone
  by that i mean they would use cheap tricks in fighting games like using the obviuosly broken character and spam moves in fighting games    like what picking m bison in champion edition and spamming psycho crusher or are you just a pussy
  i remember them from the early 2000s maybe 2006 at the latest the walmart was brand new at the time and that adcade spot was replaced with an optical center    what really threw me off was the translation for the dbz game cant remember the title for the life of me hercule was mr satan cursing stuff like that so i have no idea who handled that
  redemption machines in general make way more money than video games do in arcades and this has been the case for years
  it cannot be overstated how cool arcade games were seen as in the precrash era
/vr/ i give you the mother lode of arcade photos it hasnt been updated in 4 years and most of the photos were uploaded 9 fucking years ago but the fact remains that it has a ton of photographs from 1980s arcades almost all of which are taken by random people and not professional and/or staged stuff feel free to post anything you find in this thread    
bump
  oh shit i completely forgot about stool i remember going to some arcade when i was really small and they didnt have a stool for me to stand on and i was really sad i tried to play anyway using some horrible viewing angle where i couldnt see anything
  good find makes me nostalgic to throw away endless quarters lol
  parents holding little kids up to play a game used to be very common in 80s arcades
  ive looked for this too surprised theres nothing really good    theres a few short ones but they looked shitty
  yes and the teen girls werent all fatties
  bump
    the best arcade videos on youtube are just footage from back in the day if you search you can find old clips of people in arcades in the 80s fucking incredibly cool stuff
  you could go to sugoi
  fuck u faggot
  fact
  op it really depends on what period of gaming youre talking about     early early arcade machines were in dedicated third party arcades they would be in malls and shit kids would go there to hang out in addtition to hanging out at the mall there were also sketchier arcades kind of like bars maybe people did drugs there i dont know i never got to go in those i was like 3 showbiz and mall arcades were what i got this was around the time atari shit was huge pre home console market death pre nes     around the time of the end of the big days for atari and around the start of the big days of nintendo arcade machine popularity peeked in my opinion probably around 8691     the thing is its not even about the arcades when we talk about the popularity and cultural impact of arcade machines no its that around 86 to 91 arcade machines were everywhere fucking every where pizza places had them walmart target kmart had them up front gas stations had them god damn airports had them in the waiting area video stores had them every fucking place had them     and this was before cellphones or the internet so anytime you left the house you might be surprised by some wonderful new game that you didnt know anything about and there was a mystery when you played it how far would you get on the money in your pocket how much of the game would you get to see     then your parents would come ready to leave and you left perhaps never to see the game again gone in a puff of life smoke     mysterious exciting times     around 91/92 the fighting games hit there was a culture around that and pizza hut was getting bigger smaller towns started getting them and they usually had a mk2 cab     around 94/95 you started to see more polygon games and big sit down cab games and big screen shooting games this was around when ticket games started to creep in too this is probably also when arcades really started to die out
  this was around when ticket games started to creep in too    i mean there had been ticket games for a long time at least like 85 but 32 bit period of home gaming is when you really started to see half a normal arcade be dedicated to ticket games before that it was really only showbiz and chuckeecheese that had half a store dedicated to ticket games
on topic    
  vs nintendo machines    i only ever saw the mario one on the wild in the 90s
could someone tell me or at least give me a good hint on where i can download the latest set of chd files for mame ive been searching for days and i was only able to find one 2 tb download which turned out to be just the ls chds not what i was looking for at all
  you could play all thsoe games in all the big cities in spain    yeah but you could play them in the middle of nowhere in the us and jp shit you could probably play them in small towns in the uk and germany too
england had a great seaside arcade culture which helped to keep things alive for a while
  archiveorg has them all
  what time frame are we talking about here
  around 94/95 you started to see more polygon games and big sit down cab games and big screen shooting games this was around when ticket games started to creep in too this is probably also when arcades really started to die out  how to tell if youre in an arcade thats been around since the 90s and cant afford to throw out their old machines  mid90s fighting games including at least one version of tekken or mortal kombat  a neogeo machine that barely works  jurassic park the lost world star trek voyager or house of the dead 2 sitdown machines  showcase cabs pic related usually running fighting games but sometimes running shooting games beatemups or gauntlet legends  some simulation game like top skater prop cycle rapid river or wave runner  at least one version of house of the dead usually several if its a bigger arcade  those machines where you electrocute yourself  either cruisn sanfransisco rush or sega super gt also daytona usa but even newer arcades have that  some nonddr rhythm game they got to cash in on the late 90s/early 00s rhythm game craze usually drum mania  its always fun to find an arcade like that youd be surprised how many are still around
   machines where you electrocute yourself    why do those exist
  hes a special person
  it was both incredible and intimidating for a little kid certain machines were off limits the older cool kids had a monopoly on those youd be forced to watch you just tried to endear yourself to the older kids and sometimes theyd take a liking to you if youre funny or have some spunk that was fun    one thing i remember clearly was late at night the area outside the arcade was similar to the area outside of an old run down bar older kids would hang out there near the entrance maybe they were drinking maybe they were smoking and your parents would tell you to stay away from that area i remember a lot of times there would be fights around there and other weird stuff going on especially on mischief night it was a wild time like the wild west i wish i could go back
  i was being facetious 80s style arcades were suffering badly by the end of the 80s and many were closed by 1992 when street fighter ii saved the arcades and those that were still operational and wanted to remain so quickly transformed into what anon probably meant by 90s arcades
  believe it or not those things are among the oldest arcade games from the same era as things like nondigital skeeball they just had a resurgence in the 90s for the same reason warheads candy was popular
  i remember differently most mall arcades i remember from 91ish were already ticket arcades
  youd go in and youd want to play a particular game but someone else was always playing and then youd play something else but youd want to save quarters for the game you actually wanted to play but then when you go back to it someone new is playing it
are nonredemption arcade machines even still made outside of japan excluding pinball
  yes although raw thrills has a nearmonopoly on ones produced in america a few other companies like sega still localize japanese arcade games house of the dead scarlet down just came out last month i think every dave and busters location carries it
  house of the dead scarlet down just came out last month i think every dave and busters location carries it    well shit looks like its time to head to dave and busters
  could you post some links please
  street fighter ii  1992
  its shoei how are you surprised
  area 51 time crisis hydro thunder galaga    if an arcade doesnt have at least one of those cabinets im walking out
  whats the significance of shoei
  its japanese is all or else they didnt particularly care about western conventions
  when the fuck is that getting a console port
  street fighter ii  1992  he isnt wrong there was time lag back then between the release date and a games peak despite a 1991 release sf2 mania peaked with champion edition in 1992 vanilla sf2 did well but champion editions would literally cover an entire wall at the arcade    pac man fever social craze was also late 81 and early 1982 despite the game arriving in arcades in 1980 the pac man cartoon aired in 1982 and that was when merchandise exploded
  got fazed out but at my local walmart in tx their was a cutout room with maybe 68 arcade machines standard shooters two racing and some pinball mostly kids would just go post up there with a couple quarters while the parents shopped or youd sneak over to it while your parents checked out because they could still supervise you
wish i couldve seen the prime culture for a time as fleeting as it sounds was born in mid 90s but whenever my dad sees a pacman machine or galaga he gets the goofiest smile and proceeds to play till he gets a high score i remember pacman specifically he knew all the tricks him and all my uncles theyre total normies too
  given that it took seven years for hotd4 to get a console port probably like a decade
  i remember sfii was a completely takeover of all arcades i never saw one game so completely take over every single kids attention and coins at such a level as sfii did arcades might as well have had 50 sfii machines and nothing else because nothing else was relevant once sfii got popular every single kid at arcade was glued to either playing or watching sfii same thing happened with mortal kombat not long after that was a total takeover for anybody who played mtg growing up its similar to black summer with necropotence
  console ports of arcade games mostly stopped being a thing around the time arcades switched over to pcbased arcade boards if youre lucky sega might toss it up on some digital store eventually or throw it into a house of the dead hd collection some time in the 2020s
  that had to have been during a tournament over half the arcade is street fighter ii machines
  but why though why not put that shit on consoles why not put every arcade game on consoles nintendo hasnt even ported cruisn blast yet
  i like the idea of barcades but the reality of them is kind of depressing  the biggest problem i have with those places is the hipster clientele i hate hipsters because of how fake they are those assholes are just glib facsimiles of real people and barcades are crawling with them this probably has more to do with my hatred of modern american culture and what most people have become than barcades themselves whatever    i guess im just an old curmudgeon now
  because then people stop playing it at the arcade
  dave and busters were pretty adamant about bringing pokken tournament arcade to the west the moment the wiiu port was announced they suddenly became far less enthusiastic about the idea despite the location test doing well nowadays arcades need as many customers as they can get drawing them with exclusive games is a hell of a lot easier than trying to talk them into playing games they can play at home
  we had neo geo lands in finland
  the extra crowd and the papers on the cabinet look like part of the tournament but odds are good that was their normal amount of sf2 machines year round even here the local arcade downtown had 7 champion edition machines and i am in a small city the traveling arcade that followed the fair had over a dozen sf2 machines mix of champs and turbo this was normal in 19921993
  thats fucking bullshit
  thats why europeanexclusive arcade games dont exist right    fuck off idiot
  so many asians
  almost definitely a west coast arcade
  thats completely insane to think of how huge that game was
  
  yes arcade games are based on pc hardware nowadays so theyre super easy to emulate the biggest hurdle now is whether or not someone rips the data off the arcade machine house of the dead 5 could be ripped any time between now and years from now

whats the worst arcade you ever went to is there a place worse than chuck e cheeses
  remember when arcade in wildwood its a shame since the place was loaded with vintage arcade games from the predigital era its less an arcade and more the owners personal collection that he was only very very grudgingly lets other people play because he wants the money i didnt personally get into any kind of confrontation with the owner but he kept staring at me like he wanted me to hurry up and go i know people whove been chased out for checking their phone while theyre in there
  remember when arcade in wildwood    i looked this up and it looks cool is the guy who owns it just a faggot he looks like a faggot
  to put things into perspective the change machines were set to give you 3 quarters when you put a dollar in
  pinball petes in ann arbor is a solid retrostyle arcade thats still truckin ill never forgive them for starting to switch out the old crt monitors for flatscreen displays though
  pinball petes is one of those arcade thats legitimately survived that long i know of a few others like it on the east coast if youre into 90style arcades fun world in nashua new hampshire has to be seen to be believed it has three floors the first is all ticket games the second is loaded with deluxe machines like top skater prop cycle wave runner rapid river a fullsize sega rally and loads of other similar games the initial d and wangan midnight machines still despence cards even the wangan 2 the top floor is where they keep ddr guitar freaks and various sports games like nba jam and shit photos do not do that place justice
  females disappeared from arcades in the 90s  females    are you not allowed to say women for some reason
  wow    the guy that owns the place is literally jewish and that is the most jewish thing ive ever heard of
  that sounds fucking amazing    when was it founded
  just given the way the building looks its probably been around since the early 80s its hard to tell since they obviously prioritized keeping the largest machines so most of the ones from before 94ish had been rotated out there are huge replacement monitors for games like top skater just sitting on the floor all over the place its really got a were a gigantic arcade and fun center in the middle of fucking nowhere but were getting by vibe
  it was the local arcade the kids hung out at  that and the bike shop owners basement
  the bike shop owners basement    at best that sounds unnerving and at worst it sounds like a euphemism
  you know it probably wasnt too different from the old wild west era of internet flash games where you never really knew what new games youd stumble upon
    yes real  also shit pacman clone
  the old wild west era of internet flash games    oh man that takes me back
  i wonder how many people had rape dungeons in their basement back then
  you just dont find the same sort of enterprise and proactivity among young people of today they play it safe and stay on the computer all day
anybody here old enough to have gone to an amusement center from the days before video games
what was your favorite deluxe cabinet like those sitdown machines or the ones with bikes elaborate peripherals or walkin cabinets or whatever
  top skater is the one i put the most money into throughout the years that and the daytona games
  i guess im just an old curmudgeon now  yes you are thats why you need to be like me and find a bunch of other old curmudgeons to go play arcade games with you so you dont have to give a shit about being surrounded by hipsters
  im surprised that arcade meetups never became a big thing
  cringy even for you      tripfag did but it was just the space under his bed and it was just small animals      i went to arcades before video games but never heard them called that      i guess thats one way to go but most of those guys i know are out of practice and have early onset parkinsons or whatever i prefer playing with people who can at least try to keep up some of the teens who grew up during the retro fad arent that bad i know a few who can even give me a run for my money in some games never experienced that with the generation in between
  there definitely are still arcade communities out there the ones i know of are  the 4050 year old score attack players leftover from the 80s nearly any arcade linked to aurcade has droves of these guys  pinball players the ones that have the largest age spread these guys are very very active about organizing the local pinball community so it often turns into something more akin to very large bowling league  the fighting game players there are still circles out there that go to the arcade if they have a local one that caters to their needs round1 has started to make these guys more active these guys tend to be in their 30s but there are a bunch of college kids mixed in with them  the rhythm game players who are by far the most tightknit arcade community still out there about half a decade younger than the fighting game players but with a lot more youngblood among their ranks as a group these guys are by far the most hardcore arcade players out there owning 500 dollar controllers to practice at home is considered standard and a lot of them own ddr machines in their basements   advantage players a bunch of faggot high school kids from reddit trying to minmax their moneyticket ratio from dave and busters if they lucky enough they can sometimes break even but usually dont avoid these guys  the few the proud the ones who still meet up to play initial d and wangan midnight whether you have a group of these guys around depends entirely on whether you have an arcade that keeps these machines in good condition even v3 still has weekly groups in a lot of places  east coast competitive skeeball players its a big deal in some places  drunk nostalgia barcade kids who just want to socialize  am i forgetting any that still exist
as great as this thread is id be even more interested in hearing stories about arcades in the 70s before the height of their popularity it seems like that era is almost never discussed and yes im aware that dedicated arcades werent as much of a thing then
      i had a fairly largesized arcade in my area that lasted until just a few years ago like warehousesized buildings when sfii and mkii were at their height both games essentially took up a third of the entire floor space standard cabs the thennewly introduced larger format screen ones with the separate control panel and even a few customjob crt projector setups in their own minitent housing by that last one i dont mean rearprojection like on larger sega cabs of the time i mean full on large format screen
  thats assuming youd be lucky enough for anyone in this thread to be 60 years old and have grown up near an arcade
  the thennewly introduced larger format screen ones with the separate control panel  the proper term for those is showcase cabinet its a term few people know outside of collecting circles
  fair point
  this is actually interesting thanks for the info lol
  jillys still has a jr pacman machine in the back that was probably in the arcade somewhere when this photo was taken its a shame it didnt make it into the picture
  see right there in the back
  donkey kong  time crisis ii  metal slug  xmen  cruisn usa  sf rush  strikers 1945
  that article was from 1983 but it mentions the article from time magazine about the previous defender high score champ    imagine having your photo in time magazine just for having a high score in a video game
  
  women view the games as black holes soaking up male attention and that even liberated wives are made nervous when their male protectors act like little boys
    these are great fucking articles thanks for posting these
  what is it with modern people being so ass backwards    all i see everywhere on line these days is virtue signaling holier than thou bullshit that would make the entirety of the 1950s roll its collective eyes it was a different time posting fucking everywhere about rings that happened less than a decade ago and god damned bone headed fucktards musing about the place of this and that in modern society  not to mention how every fucking thing is a culture now    just shut the fuck up and stop being a retard    arcades still exist they are businesses that attempt to make money off kids couples and families looking to kill some time at the mall or strip mall end of story    theres no culture theres no deeper meaning about the place of such things in modern culture and theres no opertunity to look down your nose at someone for being a brutish knuckle dragging primitive    its not that big of a deal you fucking dumbass go to a fucking mall and see for yourself    /thread
  get over yourself loser
  regardless of how this poster presented it this post is still true    the exact same sentence above goes for this post as well
  theres no culture theres no deeper meaning about the place of such things in modern culture and theres no opertunity to look down your nose at someone for being a brutish knuckle dragging primitive  id really like to see your reaction to something like ctf before they changed ownership
  its hip to be autistic
  no shit
  my online reactions generally build up until i get annoyed and rage/troll depending on general mood and or topic    not to be a drunk dumbass which i am btw but what the fuck is ctf ill gladly react to it if you enlighten me
  projecting about holier than thou bullshit  having a complete and total misunderstanding of what culture is  /threading yourself  what the fuck is your definition of modern anyways are the 1950s not modern enough to your limited view of history what culture has deeper meaning is there an entire society where a populations every action whether fucking eating shitting bartering etc was actually intended to be just an incredibly clever metaphor for something else that anthropologist have yet to decipher    i dont even think its autism just genuine stupidity
  not invited to the hug circle eh    well heres a thought everything i said is true im sick and tired of every fucking thing being a culture and every fucking thing needing to be mused about to death twice by dumbasses with zero critical thinking skills  because anyone with said critical thinking skills wouldnt even give any of this shit a second thought beyond its fun    if i offended you i am sorry believe it or not but im not sorry because you feel bad im sorry that your life is so worthless that a superficial freak out by an angry stranger on 4chan of all places is that important to you as in i feel sorry for you you pathetic animal
  in 20 years will morons ask if movie theaters and walmarts have a place in modern society
  if i offended you i am sorry believe it or not but im not sorry because you feel bad im sorry that your life is so worthless that a superficial freak out by an angry stranger on 4chan of all places is that important to you as in i feel sorry for you you pathetic animal
  chinatown fair really ghettoass place in new york that was always loaded with really hardcore players up until 2012ish it was arguably the most famous arcade in the country because of how deeply ingrained it was in the fighting scene going in that place felt like walking into fight club
  both of those will still exist and youre an idiot if you think otherwise
   coast competitive skeeball players its a big deal in some places    huh i did not realize this was even a thing
  oh yeah especially in ocean city nearly every arcade on the boardwalk like 12 of them has a daily skeeball tournament of some sort some places have actual tournaments while others have raffles for money prizes that require a qualifying score to enter the locals go to jillys and train on their 10 cent skeeball machines
   4050 year old score attack players leftover from the 80s nearly any arcade linked to aurcade has droves of these guys  aurcade    thanks for the heads up about this site i had never even heard of it before
   players the ones that have the largest age spread these guys are very very active about organizing the local pinball community so it often turns into something more akin to very large bowling league    huh i love pinball but i never realized the fanbase was this active or widespread
  white shirt central
   fighting game players there are still circles out there that go to the arcade if they have a local one that caters to their needs round1 has started to make these guys more active these guys tend to be in their 30s but there are a bunch of college kids mixed in with them    its weird how old the fighting game community has become
  nah the fighting game community is still mostly college kids but the vast majority play exclusively on console at arcades if you see anyone that age theyre probably playing a newer series like blazblue the veterans tend to stick to older series the new street fighter games tend to draw a little bit of both
  do arcade games have a place in modern society    arcades have been doing fine and surviving in asia especially in the far east and some parts in southeast asia its not really as widespread as they were before but theyre still around
  they barely even get by in japan anymore the most profitable places there are all redemption machines
living in malaysia and i gotta say as far as i remember arcades have been going strong during the 80s until the derby machines were installed in the 90s and got people real hooked they cost real money to play than tokens  this led to a decline in arcades in a lot of places in the cities where licensing which are supposedly applied to curb gambling machines hit game cabinets as well     despite this some arcades are still operating today and they were crowded during the late 90s and the early 2000s most of them survive in department store however and our weeb pm managed to get some businesses with the japanese bringing in their big chain stores like sogo and jusco which happen to have arcades as practically a requirement this is probably the reason why a lot of the arcade cabinets here are japanese or even japanese exclusive despite the words flashing for sale in japan only in those old crts i guess they offload and imported the older cabinets that are more than 4 years old to be set up here then though not always
  derby machines    what is this
    its the rainbow tunnel that was in the imageworks located upstairs above the ride in the original version of the journey into imagination ride in epcot center at walt disney world the whole upstairs area was closed to guests in 2000 when the ride was changed to journey into your imagination though a newer and significantly more lame version of the imageworks opened downstairs
  interesting thanks for the info
  king derby gambling cabinets were unregulated back then so they even end up in normal arcades     
  so there are or were arcades that are basically casinos in disguise built entirely around machines like that
  he hasnt seen this episode  no euphemisms at all friend
  lol our local track and field cab got physically punished if you smashed your knee into the front plate near the coin slot it would throw credits nearly every time
        do they still have a place in society  no they were only a stopgap for technology differences between modern arcade/comp games is almost nil its ogre    born in early 80s here but imma going to say that the arcade experience in the early 90s was about the same as it was in the 80s  the big thing that drew all of your attention immediately was this thing  the token pusher as a kid it was like the lottery if you could manage to get it to work it was probably the first solid indoctrination to gamble if you were poor and your family was poor you couldnt bother to even drop 1 token in it to try your luck because you probably only had like 5 bucks worth of tokens and that was precious for the limited time and games you could play there   but that was the huge thing that drew attention at the arcade kids version of the slot machine    the bigtime games that drew attention was stuff with a gun attached to it and stuff you had to get inside to play also anything with good graphics for the time another thing is games that may have made a transition to nes or snes but because of the arcade tech could be drawn in more detail with more colors and in arcade format the perspective on characters was usually somehow larger than it was on the console version im just going to rattle off some titles here that always ate my tokens   some nba game that got ported directly to genesis and looks beautiful on crt/rf   terminator 2 light gun game   teenage mutant ninja turtles 2   afterburner of course   1942 or 1943 i forget which   mrs pac man  as for the experience  it was better than the movies the parents mightve went to see leaving you babysat by your friends or brother at the arcade for 2 hours  you didnt want to leave even if you ran out of tokens      people tired of current culture and the lack of creativity in further expanding it weve hit our limit so theyre forced to look to the past for answers
    gfdamit right in the feels  mere months after i had been born that picture was taken i may cry   though im sure this picture may have been worthy of crying over the sight of seeing your own arcade machine right there in the truck   no longer will it eat your quarters because you can get them all back again      as others mentioned a couple frenzy inducing games to panic spend tokens on to keep playing were street fighter 2 and mortal kombat it was also confusing as heck and difficult to pull off doing combo moves even though the combinations were usually listed right there on the plaque for the game thats where you really ate through tokens because youd really focus on trying to do some move and get your butt kicked because you wasnt paying attention to the normal gameplay so youd have to keep dumping tokens until you managed to get it right and incorporate that move into your skill set die before even getting the move off because youre not even looking at the screen if you were poor like me and only had 25 bucks of tokens per visit because dadjustdoesntunderstand then that could wipe you out before you even got a chance to get the move done properly  arcade games started their downward spiral around 19982000 and it was mostly due to playstation full stop end of story because many of the games that were being recycled year after year or had never moved from their spot for the last 510 years could now be played or rivaled in quality by the psone   n64 was really abit more cartoony than cinematic but it helped drive psone so it did have its effect too if indirectly  destruction derby tekkens resident evils silent hill this shit was like having your own arcade machines   pizza hut  yeahhh i must have lost 1015 bucks in quarters total playing that nba game and 1942 with the smell of breadsticks and oregano in the air under dim light  it was romance as a kid it rivaled the experience of sex as an adult
  some more examples i remember from the old days was   pang  gotta prevent these balloons from hitting the ground or something like that character shoots steel arrows up to pop them   aliens/ripley game side scroller   the simpsons side scroller game which has a really fat guy wrestler at the end of the first level as a boss almost undefeatable  remembered those from a laundromat movie theater lobby and a local yearly festival      but seriously the thing that killed the arcade was technology at some point all of the technology catches up and theres a threshold for keeping people entertained when the game quality is good enough then its not worth paying the extra expense or time to go out of your way for something a little more    i dont see vr or holographic projections as being anything to write home about either its easy enough to get suspension of disbelief looking at the tv/monitor if anything these experiences are just a trivial trinket  oh thats neat but it doesnt offer anything truly new in the content aspect people arent into true realism nobody has gotten true edgy gore right anyway and its abit too scary to watch    might just be my unjaded 90s eyes but for example some game made in 2008 can keep me entertained just as good as one made in 2017 if im playing it for the first time and its got enough content to it i still let graphic issues or lack of realism pass as long as the overall mood is still appropriate and its not blatant polygonz    fruck i still play fear even though ive got the maps memorized games like that have the mood and the visuals are good enough from screens and vids ive seen of doom 16 im not more impressed with it than i was with doom3 im not really into multiplayer games i prefer going against ai opponents who i have an inherent stat based advantage against who have variety and tie it in to some kind of plot or story
        the main idea ive had to expand on game culture is having much greater indepth fps games which are focused on single player without the open world architecture but still go on for 100 hours and keeps the short road to victory a secret  reuse of some assets map blocks changing colors on things or slapping new skins on them is okay as long as the behavior or setup is different just to keep the production time manageable and focus the size of the game on its maps    couple ideas i had that basically make you feel lost   some fps counter terrorist game  where you get pushed around into an increasingly paranormal fringelike experience that goes nonstop for the character they would have to be cut off and on their own for most of the time some cutscenes might involve the character resting or eating but unlike a season of 24 it just keeps going on and on and becoming more psychological some open architecture is okay but no openworld shit send the player to other locations because they have to get there by car in time to prevent some fbi raid from getting put into a blender because his superiors arent listening to his crazy advice anymore     some silent hill style game  where the player might be occasionally jutted into alternate realities which they may or may not be able to find their way back from or may be able to do either to progress the story and then having to even switch between or be handed new characters to pass the torch with and the longer they stay alive the more of these characters they have available to get to the end of the game done right it doesnt have to stay in the same locale different item mechanics could change the game halfway through into a borderline shump instead of survival horror could end up having to face nightmarish formerdeadcharacters as bosses so an incentive not to die    by removing the freedom of absolute open world sandbox it keeps you focused on moving forward
you guys have anything from the 90s
  its in the wargame franchise of rts games
  sort of granted almost all of the arcades here nowadays run on tokens that you buy but cant exchange for actual money this leads to a loophole where games like ocean king fish which can be used for gambling are instead repurposed to run on tokens instead of money granted this didnt exactly stop people from hoarding tokens just to play this especially old chinese people who visit these parts
  theres been plenty of discussion of 90s arcades in here
i need to go to bed because im supposed to be at work in 8 hours but itll be my friday so please recommend me some good arcade games to try out via mame especially platformers and racing games but also beatemups shmups and puzzle games
  platformers  pig out  beatemups  denjin makai  guardians / denjin makai ii  gaia crusaders  sengoku 3  ninja baseball bat man  the punisher  battle circuit  cadillacs and dinosaurs  warriors of fate  alien vs predator  armored warriors  captain commando  vendetta  die hard arcade  dynamite cop  shmups  space bomber  xexex  xmultiply  batsugun  in the hunt  puzzle games  uo poko
  thanks i deeply appreciate it
  no problem you want any more recommendations i was mostly sticking to less obvious stuff excluding the capcom beat em ups
  sure any more puzzle games you can recommend or platformers    ideally ones with endings rather than dozens of hours and a killscreen i want to pick something to try and 1cc
  im gonna second his recommendation of ninja baseball bat man its one of the best early 90s beatemups out there but its a game most people outside of arcade nerds have ever played
my time in arcades was about 8791 it was awesome an absolutely fascinating experience for a kid 711 years old especially at the younger end playing loud games with creepy themes in the dark was actually rather scary but in a good way     my local arcade pic related was the major distributor of coinops in the region so their collection was huge with a legacy of hundreds of games going back from the newest games at the time back to 70s games like night driver and pinball machines    i dont remember the kids drinking alcohol and smoking everyone is talking about in this thread that must have died off by the late 80s my time was several years ahead of the early 80s arcade boom when teens would have seen arcades as hip all those games from that boom were there though as well as new games seeing teenage mutant ninja turtles there for the first time blew my mind and was a triumphant experience compared to the first nes game    i also remember the songs the jukebox would bump double dragon was in the front right next to the jukebox and i have clear vivid nostalgia of playing it while this song was playing  
  i was at chinatown fair once in 2001 good memories of playing pump it up with some dudes who were really nuts breakdancers
went to a local bar/arcade today i had fun overall but altered beast ate my credit and i didnt get to play it

  brazils laws forbid the importing of video games so they are manufactured locally and are given the necessary touch of international chic with such english names as aster action and munch man     can barely find anything on these games there does seem to be a game called aster action but its a modern hentai game found this image but not sure if its the same thing would love to see more weirdo foreign video games
  im betting aster action and munch man were just identical clones of asteroids and pacman but with changed title screens
i just broke 100000 in joust
  i imagine going to arcade on friday night 10pm hearing a whisper from the corner  hey kid wanna taste something good and then theres 60 year old guy with grey beard pants down sitting in one of the outrun machines sit next to me and ill show you good time you obey and sit and he pulls out a huge throbbing cock take my stick as you touch his cock he forces your head down and forces you to suck his cock its all dark and nobody can really see too well it looks like someone is just playing the game you suck until the old guy comes into your mouth nicely done good game     this is how ops childhood was and his love for arcades come from experiences like this it all happened probably hundreds of times
  so dave n busters
  munchman is a ti99 cartridge its a pac man clone and its called munchman in america    i have no idea what this game has to do with brazil doubt it was even released there
  nice congratulations
  hes right tho
  doubt very much thats the same much man although i guess its possible huefags might have put tis with games in them in arcade cabs like other 3rd world shitholes do with pcs today
whats the best equipment to capture the visuals of a crt display
anything you can set the shutter speed manually with so most cameras you want to match or half the shutter speed on the camera to the refresh rate of the screen to avoid seeing lines on the screen something you can set white balance with manually with would be good too    just use anything that works though sometimes i feel i get better pics just using my phones camera on auto settings
  google says a camera with an adjustable variable shutter rate  sonys name for that feature is clear scan
  i just used a camera i had around and lowered the exposure
  this is pure sex for my eyes
i havent seen a diablo thread in a while so why not ive still never finished d2 but im currently playing it solo assassin  favorite class  favorite game in the series 1 2 vanilla expansion  cool items youve found
  started playing again yesterday    i only installed classic and i feel like the map generation is more diverse and the loot toned down a little more meaningful    playing as a skeleton necromancer its fun to see your skeletons running stuff down
  i tried playing a skeleton necromancer but it just felt like too much of a passive gameplay experience for me maybe im just not into pet classes and yeah i should consider running through vanilla d2 at some point even if its just out of curiosity
  ive met a green fallen shaman unique that teleported around i didnt even know this existed
tfw cant decide if i should slam my surs into bers and make infinity or make enigma  coh  tfw found random jah while testing a build in the pits  tfw nobody likes diablo  tfw thread is dead  tfw nobody to reply to this post  tfw aussieb died before finding a hoz  tfw /v/net never again
i used to love building assasins and paladin characters right now im changing a bit and doing an amazon just for fun so far im at act ii
  but dont you have phone xd
  i just started playing this i beat the classic game and the lod expansion game classic is so much better the game gets ridiculous with all the stuff the expansion adds you get so strong that it takes all the challenge out of the game you are not playing diablo anymore all there is left is grinding to make the game even easier i wasnt into that
  loot games  challenging  i had multiple 85 in the eu hc ladder theres nothing challenging about grinding gear and pumping vit/res until youre good to move to the next area
  fucking casual
the only issue with lod are the charms they are modtier content and kinda break the game by bridging two areas of the gameplay inventory management and equipment
  good thing that is fixed with plugy
  skeletons do not do viable damage in hell classic like they do in lod another thing that annoyed the hell out of me is that the skeletons poof when you move between acts in classic but d2s nec is still og        on the one hand classics item system is comfy because rares are the best items and they are very random    on the other hand lod is patched to make lots of random areas in all acts lvl 8185 the overpowered stuff takes hundreds of hours to assemble unless you trade on jsp or cheat by comparison classic just has the cs
  wasted all these runes just to make one sur  instead of doing a few hundred nm lk runs    shame on you
  you get so strong that it takes all the challenge out of the game you are not playing diablo anymore  what lod is way way harder than classic all the enemy damage life density and many other buffs were given to enemies the only way you will be stronger is if you have been grinding for hundreds of hours and by that point challenge is no longer relevant whether you are playing classic or lod
what solo class is the most fun this trap assassin just isnt working out for me especially regarding large ranged mobs
  define fun because they all cater to some niche i dont know whats your thing dude  maybe you want to hulk out as a barbarian maybe you want to zip around as a sorceress  try out these loose guidelines  be a huge motherfucking melee tank with relatively low dependence on finding a good weapon  2handed berserker barbarian the reason you dont die is because you synergize with howl taunt which can be used to stop archers from shooting and just walk to you and you also want some war cry if you find something good like a cruel rare polearm or a good unique you can go ww singletarget only but good at crushing bosses frenzy is also good but id reroll those magic weapons with chippies like a motherfucker since you need two good weapons on solid elite bases to succeed in hell its a total massacre all the way thru nightmare though  kill things fast in melee relatively low gear dependence  teslazealot kills shit really fast and you can make him erase things with a cracked kris in nightmare all you need is attack speed its kinda like a melee caster in that regard highly resistant to lightning so you dont fear gloams so much use smite and conversion for crowd control crushes bosses fast just swap to a cb setup and smite them until death  selfreliant ranged dps with really beefy summons  amazon with a couple hard points into decoy and/or valk pure java is a screenclearer pure bowa too but needs a good bow smooth levelling with an explosive arrow build but drink a lot of mana hybrids lf/strafe or lf/fa are good too between decoy/valk/maybe fa youre really safe even as a bowa that goes dexvita  i will take time to farm a ribcracker  werewolf druid shits on everything with this unassuming exceptional staff has nice lifesteal and also a good summon entourage  i wont take time to farm a ribcracker  windy druid then level as fire though it mows down normal fast
  cont  this is my firsttime hc character  go necromancer both boners and skelemancers are really fast safe and selfreliant curses are your answer to all your problems  ranged packs get dim vision everything else gets amplify damage whatever build you go you will go corpse explosion as well  it clears entire screens a bit more of a slog on /players 8 but powerful and selfreliant nonetheless with either bone wall spam or a skeleton entourage you have a hard time dying  i want to farm act bosses and be highly mobile  sorceresses in all flavors are good and rather skillintensive when they have to find their own sources of fcr and mana since you have to think on your own feet and on your own teleport and not hide behind a tank even if you can freeze entire screens frozen orb is a good core skill to use because it just works really well with little to no synergy but its not the only one blizzard fireball meteor chain lightning or even firewall are all skills you can focus on just go dualelement unless youre fine with skipping all immune packs
ham  mer  din
  tfw /v/net never again
  does diablo 2 get better after act ii    its alright but i thought this was the game that created hundreds of clones    i like the atmosphere but idk im playing a paladin and it just feels lacking
  normally go amazon or necro but started playing an elemental drood today and im having a blast ive played every class now skele necro with a few points in curses is still my fave though
  if you dont like act 2 atmosphere you will not like act 3    act 4 and 5 feel like a totally different game tho
  cant do end game with necro summoner
  yes you can moreover its literally considered the safest build to do endgame with
  even ubers can be done by a necro summoner get a fuckton of urdars for massive crushing blow and you can do it on budget gear if you have an item with teleport charges
median xl 2017 team here
  release sigma already you lazy fucks
  i dont think anyone likes act 2 and 3 theyre just there i guess
  act ii was meh  act iii sucks dick  it gets better at iv and v
  act 3 is the best act    clever enemy design punishes stupid play and spammers  crazy unpredictable map generation that can make it almost as short as act 4 or by far the longest act depending on your luck  has three of the best farming spots in the game  highly unique level design not like any other act  two permanent boost quests
  i really liked my ice orb sorceress teleporting around the map w/ map hack on blasting and looting scores of monsters soloing baal wash rinse repeatprofit
j u s t
  alright thanks
  anon spends a whole month grinding these runes in nm lk  this happens
  being an insightard  deserved it insight is an unethical runeword
bet you niggas cant handle my perfect roll     dabs
which builds/chars can solo hell im thinking about playing this game again and beating it through hell since ive never done it
  also best mf builds since ill be using plugin
    all of them can solo hell what do you mean exactly best mf build is a blizz sorc for a starter one at least after that all sorcs are good with gear javazons are good zerkers are good hammerdins poison necros    if you just wanna beat the game play anything you want if you wanna play seriously you gotta start with a sorc pretty much and dont listen to the hipsters saying otherwise youll end up wasting your time and having less fun also i hope you meant plugy
  yes i did mean plugy my bad but the deepest i ever got was act 3 with a meterorb sorc before it became to tedious for me not that im looking to breeze through hell but when i say best i mean one that can get through it with decent gear and good crowd control especially with all the immunities and bonuses in hell
  sorc and you can respec with plugy whenever you want to if you really want to just beat the game then paladin is easier
  i know i can but id rather not do that the only reason i like plugy is to keep gear otherwise its like im not playing the game the way it was meant to be played
  well if you know so much about the game then just do what you want mayne
  but when i say best i mean one that can get through it with decent gear and good crowd control  every character has amazing crowd control and every character can easily slaughter hell with decent gear hell isnt bad even with complete shit gear if you know how to use your skills properly
  assassin is the most fun solo for me but trapsin is not do a martial arts sin its difficult because theyre very fragile especially untwinked/sp but theyre a ton of fun tiger strike is a fucking amazing one point wonder or you can even max it out if you really want to and then you can pick cold/lightning and youve got a fucking damage dealer
  i used to dislike 2 and 3 a lot but now i think theyre pleb filters
i loved the summonmancer no stress and very productive
anyone here ever get a 200 fcr on d2 is it worth having it that high
  theres a max breakpoint somewhere around there that isnt worth going above but i dont remember
  game gets worse with every new act
  that is the max breakpoint for fcr for sorc
  i guess they never miss huh
  all of these are good for starters    
  dtail is really fun since it makes a fire damage explosion based on your physical damage all you need is decent boots and maxed tiger strike and maybe an amp curse and you have a 15k fire explosion easily
i actually really enjoyed poisonmancer once i got to act 3 and poison nova got off the ground
      also since im doing a two element sorc if im going to have a high fcr what should be my two main spells i was thinking fireball and orb but should i maybe do lightning and orb instead or just stick with fb and orb and throw in meteor
  but should i maybe do lightning and orb instead or just stick with fb and orb and throw in meteor  honestly both are good and dont fret over it so much fo/fb is more mainstream and i suppose has better base damage
  i guess im wondering which benefits more from having a really high fcr since id want to kill shit as fast as possible
anyone here like the hell unleashed or aftermath mods me and some friends would play the crap out of aftermath back in the day wolf/bear melee druid with hazel seer was my fave
  well yeah this is true but if youve played the game as much as i have these days chances are youll hate 2 and 3 most people ive seen are like that just fed up with these acts theyre just tedious for me whereas 1 4 and 5 are still fun for me somehow      yes it is worth at least for lk running on your sorc i run 200 fcr for that and theres also a really expensive 200 fcr lightning build for super fast clear speed that i havent tried but im sure its worth using for something        my nigga look at the brakepoints in this link try them and decide for yourself since lighting/cl have different ones than the rest of the sorc spells        generally the vast majority go for 105 for normal spells and 117 for lighting/cl and this means only those two skills not all lighting skills you should only be running less if youre just starting and on a budget        also our boy released a new video and someone asked exactly for this earlier
  they are really fun solo requires serious amounts of dedication to get past the bosses without allies only time i played a multiplayer mod multiplayer was aftermath as a fist of heavens pally with a rabies druid buddy
  i keep trying to come back but my d2 expiriences never end up feeling satisfying so i just leave it halfway  half the times i play with my cousing who being a neet has a lot of free time for himself so when we dont play for like 23 days he just decides to power level/grind items and ends up becoming elder god tier  then when i play solo i just get up to end of act 2 if anything probably because i tend to play really passive classes/specs
  nobody asked
having never previously played diablo games ive recently finished d1 and now about to play d2 should i play start with vanilla and then try lod or should i go with the expansion right away does it make a difference for a normal playthrough
  classic and lod are very different as are unpatched classic and classic as well as version 108 lod 109 lod and 110 lod    classic is a bit difficult    unpatched classic  janky and straightforward grinding is unnecessary and you can pretty much do anything and still win on the hardest difficulty enemies do not have immunities ever  patched classic  magics and rares are king takes a bit of forethought to beat since immunities now exist and overall enemies are a bit stronger  109 lod  the stupidest version of the game by far any enemy that spawns with the lightning enchanted property will one hit kill you and enemies in general are stronger than they were in classic much harder than classic overall  110 lod  the standardized version of the game added in synergies which prevents redundant characters by encouraging specialization made all the monsters way way stronger this is many times over harder than 109 this version assumes you have played one of the previous version requires a lot of grinding or a decent understanding of game mechanics to beat despite the much increased difficulty it is the most polished and complete version
  lod has a lot of quality of life improvements the only reason i would play classic is if i wanted to play an older patch of the game that would let me take advantage of the higher drop rate for things and stronger skills  lod has some great changes though like being able to give hireable mercenaries items to equip
is there a game prior to d2 with skill trees or is diablo 2 the pioneer of them ive been looking for more retro with similar character building
  do people use mods plan to replay d2lod should i just stick with unmodded or is there something interesting
  id like to note that some classes feel like absolute ass to play in d2 classic simply because its much harder to get a good weapon  bowazons in lod are fun to play and really safe between frozen arrow ranged weaponry and two extremely beefy tanks even if they require some patience because theyre by far the most underpowered in terms of sheer damage output without some gear im talking about a blade bow harmony bowie or an upped witchwild string build not someone packing faith or windforce  bowazons in classic are like trying to fuck a cactus
  you should play lod and with plugy
  plugy and you can mod it yourself if you want too
    i cubed infinity   you have an infinitys worth of trash runes that have been sitting in the stash for years  you even have a handicap because plugy removes the gems from the cube recipes    anon we each have our styles of play we should make allowances for diversity of ideas its not healthy to be close minded ethnocentric why are you such a fucking racist anon
  yikes
always wanted to make a psn dagger build but there just never seems a reason to use it over nova or explosion once they are all leveled up
  you need treachery and poison skill damage for poison dagger to be good
  so me and my girl are planning to play through diablo 2 again but im pretty bored of vanilla median xl is shit but what other d2 mods are there
does plugy not work with the direct play version of 113c from buccaneer bay i install it and certain things work start in a window for instance but none of the game play features function i did check the ini
  the direct play version of 113c from buccaneer bay    i have no idea about this version and this website but you can use plugy with a pirated version maybe you did something wrong or maybe its the crack itself or a previous install interfering check a guide on youtube and try a fresh install and maybe delete registry entries for d2
bitchass niggas check me out
anyone wanna play diablo 1 using that tchernobog thing ill settle for some median xl but i want to play immersively and do all the quests and the like
  i dont want to leave you hanging since nobody will offer but i dont want to play either of these sorry
  what about vanilla lod
  too bad cham is trash pretty much the most worthless rune in the entire game
  cant because im invested in my plugy mod and i dont want to start again
  its alright anon i wouldnt have really played vanilla anyhow
  true i wish i had gotten a ber instead i really need one but im getting the grail and i also want to make botd so i have half a zod now
  path of diablo if you like path of exile
  coolest item in diablo two is a rare ethereal crystal sword with cruel knights affixes  anything else
  path of diablo is nothing like path of exile path of diablo is just diablo 2 with some added uberquests and a few very poorly balanced skills
they dont make levels like this anymore
  you even have a handicap because plugy removes the gems from the cube recipes  false i tried to transmute 3 thuls alone and i couldnt you act as if having plugy totally means thats a default when its entirely optional and its disabled by default
ive played d2 for years but only recently got into d1 and ive been wondering is there anything else to the combat system than to click as fast as i can  i mean does it have some timing aspect to it if i let my guy attack until the end of the animation does it have any benefit over clicking as much as possible it seems like mashing really fast doesnt play the animation until the end but miss chances make it difficult to figure on my own
  interesting take on randomly generated content using the word make
  diablo 2 didnt have a creator it was evolution
  today i learned procedurally generated levels were not made have a ghostly ghost
playing single player with plugy its pretty dope almost level 60 in nm farming andy and meph for decent drops occy from meph pls    im using leaf and using meteor im curious when i should switch to blizzard after occy     also single player already has felt a lot more rewarding my friends dont play anymore so there is no reason for bnet
  ive played d2 for years but only recently got into d1 and ive been wondering is there anything else to the combat system than to click as fast as i can  not really the entire meat of the combat is to get into good positioning and you might get some abilities on your weapons or other items like a knockback on a bow that will affect the battlefield also spells which anyone can use there are a few tricks you can use like swinging at an empty square that an enemy is about to walk into may cause the enemy to stagger back into his original square which is an useful tactic to minimize damage against certain opponents aside from that most of the difficulty is dealing with ranged characters and avoiding getting mobbed
  thats what ive been doing just got to hell was a nice surprise to get a new sprite for my character with the higher level armors   i wish the genre had improved on the positioning and added more nuance to the minor aspects of the combat instead of full spam
  does plugy have an option for disabling the need for gems for cubing runes i dont recall seeing that anywhere or has that been added in some newer version
any good single player mods something that makes the levels not so boring and huge to run around
are there any mods for d2 that reduce the absurd reliance on potion spamming i understand that until poe it was a big part of the genre but i never liked it
  never understood the love for d2 i finished d2 and d1 and d1 is by far the superior game in atmosphere    d1 a town in darkness and haunted by evil that quite literally has hell under itself opening  the ending is basically a evil ending where diablo wins and makes you his slave the end    d2 colorful world tour smash monsters in europe smash monsters in desert smash monsters in mountains smash monsters in the jungle whats this diablo is dead oh here go after his brother congratulations you win    what are some memorable personalities from d2  name like 3 outside of cane
  pod is trash stop shilling      it doesnt have it the retard just doesnt know shit about d2 you mod it in yourself      you should switch to blizzard when you get a base to make a spirit sword you can pair it up with rhyme or pledge while youre searching for a monarch to make a spirit shield    and in my opinion its a waste of time to farm nm except to target a soj from andy its highly unlikely that youll get an occy especially fast enough to make it worth it youre missing out on easy exp and drops      plugy and mod it in a way that makes mana a non issue theres many ways
  youre right but gameplay wise d2 is way better and its a video game after all i really cant stick to playing d1 for a long time    charsi akara my boy warriv
  the thing i liked about d1 was there are no classes if you have the stats to get a spell you can get it    i always loved my warrior and building a town portal spell on him or other spells
  tfw never played d1    i want to die
   never played d1  what is preventing you from playing it now for the first time
  insight merc
  too invested in d2 and im a wageslave now so i have less time i always keep telling myself ill play it soon but i never do
tfw finally a 2/20 coronet     my boy pindle hella based
  eastern sun is a pretty neat modbest to use d2se for it however given it was made for 110
  it takes like 15 hours to get to diablo
  more like 5 hours diablo is a very short game
  give d1 a try my best memory are after reading this quest  i think i got lucky because when this dialog was playing i got the screaming children music of d1 in the background    use the time code to get the song  
  screaming children song  
  noice
hell mephisto is being so stingy    3 bartucs   2 arreats face  3 jalals mane    no occy 
i demand an update on assuiebs health and grail status did he get his hoz tell me now
  just make spirit or hoto my dude
so i found this site from our boy dbrunski        its an only holy grail list thing post yours rate others hows mine
  i have a spirit sword but id rather have occy
  i thought you were the dude still using leaf rng can be fucked heres my grail    and ive only found one occy
  oh im the same dude im off of the leaf for sure
i remember playing d1 on psx with my brother i never finished it on psx and we usually just past time by duplicating items by copying memories and trading    a couple of years ago i tried playing it on pc and i finishes solo in a couple of hours by farming a couple of lowers levels    this got me thinking its posible to win d1 without creating new worlds in the first difficulty at least i dont remember seeing this option on psx might be wrong i was very young back then might try to emulate later
  im off of the leaf for sure    heh
how do you guys think about the possibility that youve maybe missed a ber rune because it dropped off screen
can you do the act5 cheat with the plugy mod
  yes
aww dudes  i was inspired by this thread to once more finish d1 and after this play hellfire for the first time i never played hellfire so    dam is d1 good  i dont know if its game mechanics or be doing stupid leveling or some glitches however d1 was brutal and bosses felt brutal like real bosses  strap yourself back for story time    1 start game with warrior is going easy decide to also level spell capacity and cast spells  2 everything is fine  3 find books level in magic and eat the books to get spells  4 still smash things however now i can spam lightning all over the place to catch monsters who run away or archers in the distance  5 monkey cats try to gang fuck me spam lightning at them they die quicker then from me trying to kill them with the sword did i level wrongly or is magic the perfect solution for the monkey cats  6 go on find the butchers layer i think im ready to face him save before him just in case  7nightmarish fight the fucker is not dropping dead and im eating potions like crazy can not run away try to spam magic nothing kills him no life bar for the boss so i have no idea how im doing i die wow that was hard  8 once more this time when i open the door i spam lightning into his home so he gets damaged before he can get to me  fight him by smashing him in the face all the time use potions win  9 holy shit was this thrilling he really felt like someone who was a boss  10 continue on adventure normally    the next chapter is called hell bat of wtf is this
    11 be adventuring and get into the catacombs open passageway back to town  12 bats gargoyles are here and they are dropping dead i use lightning and sword to get them down  13 clear out rooms like nothing  14 get into a room there is a legendary red bat gargoyle there  15 mostly ignores me there are other bat gargoyles so i kill them first  16 time to kill a legendary red bat gargoyle boy  17 start fighting him my character looks like he is glitched or the bat is staggering him and i can only land 10 of my attacks  18 spam lightning at the fucker  19 sword to the face of the monster  20 eat potions like there is no tomorrow  21 wtf this fucker is not dying  22 town portal back to town  get more potions and repair equipment save game  23 back to bat  24 same shit out of potions to town save and back  25 eat potions like there is no tomorrow is this glitched  26 back to town same shit  27 bat manages to murder me reload to previous save realize my mother fucking armor vanished i did not see warnings about it did the fucker destroy my armor is this glitched is this his special ability or some shit  28 jokes on you i have extra armor in town
  29 get wall of fire staff lets see if you like magic spam you fucken bat  30 go back to fight create fire everywhere bat takes damage makes pain sounds run out of stick magic back to sword to the face strategy  31back to town routine  32back to town routine  33 back to town routine im running out of money sell magic stick and extra crap to get potions  34back to fighting  35back to town routine  36back to town routine  37 im seriously having problems here  38fighting no money left last potions die you peace of shit  39 bat dies jesus christ almighty was this glitched  40 lets check how i leveled up from minimal xp the fuck i did all of this for nothing all the gold and equipment lost for nothing  41 was i supposed to avoid this fucker come back after i leveled up on different dungeons  42 dang man this really feels like going into the pits of hell cant wait to play some more
  meanwhile this is how d3 was  1 start game  2 can not select anything else then ultra easy baby mode other modes are unlocked after other completions of the game  3 whatever take summoner hero class  4 play some monsters dropp dead like nothing  5 get summon golem spells and bouncing fire ball  6 i practically press some buttons and my bouncing balls and golems annihilate everything of screen  7 playing games like on rails more story and i feel like im watching a movie  8 nephilim bla bla bla  something something diablo is back  9 adria turns out to be evil and was a diablo worshiper from the start i liked this from a story perspective   10 diablos war on heaven more story  11 bosses can not outdamage me  12 literally if i stand still and spam my fireballs and golems bosses who focus me  a summoner can not outdamage me while hitting me in the face i have regeneration or life steal or some shit i forgot what and bosses can not outdamage me i can simply stand there and be hit in the face and they can not outdamage me my life bar is not even twitching  13 lets go balls to the walls boys  14 remove armor from myself and remove all equipment enemies still can not even make my life bar move even if they are hitting me in my face and ganging up on me1111oneoneoneon  15 bosses can not outdamage me even after i removed all equipment from myself1111oneoneoneeleven  16 something about some dude in the desert some human who believed humans are superior and was using his own blood to be immortal or some shit  17 whatever i dont feel like playing this game any more its a pointless waiting before im railroaded to my next in game movie
    on the other hand i remember my first time fighting the butcher and how challenging he was my first d1 character was a archer and the butcher was so hard and i was so incapable of killing him that i literally made a warrior and started the game anew i remember this to this day    the monsters felt like they are demons who can rip you to peaces and you are a human trying to survive you where a great hero however there where some super powerful demons    what has d3 literally ultra easy baby mode that you need to finish to get slightly more challenging modes where you literally can have no equipment and stand still and the bosses will not even make your lifebar move    im no ultra hardcore fag however this is simply silly you are unable to select more challenging difficult even if you selected a option and write a email to bliz to give me all the difficulties    i can not remember practically anything about d3 bosses however the hell bat and the butcher will be great stories for me to remember to this day and great fun to tell    so what has d3 play the same ultra easy game only this time its a little more challenging the same story why what made d1 great is its random quests so that you never see all the quests in one play of the game and it was challenging unlike d3
  personally i love the warriorsorc hybrid build and stacking high magic items to learn spells if youre playing single player you can save the items in town on the floor and pick them up to learn higher level books for warrior leveling magic to 35 and using scroll of stone curse once or twice was the way i killed him my first time if you armor is damaged itll low on the bottom right brown indicating its fucked up red meaning its almost completely fucked as a warrior you can repair it if you want but the durability will always drain on it and it gets to the point it will 100 be destroyed hellfire implements some fixes for this through oils and other things you dont need to beat diablo 1 to play the expansion btw if you plan on playing through it again though feel free to wait until after you beat diablo 1 by its self gargoyles regen very fast when they drop into the stone form or statue form whatever you want to call it iirc theyre super resistant to lightning but its been a while for myself reminder that hellfire is non canon and has nothing to do with the actual diablo storyline
  personally i love the warriorsorc hybrid build  same here my man  you can save the items in town on the floor  i know its the joke that the town is your inventory   if you armor is damaged itll low on the bottom right brown indicating its fucked up red meaning its almost completely fucked  i know and im looking out for it only   while fighting the legendary red wtf hell bat there was no warning simply when i opened the inventory my armor was not on my character    i finished d1 back in the day and decided to go back  you dont need to beat diablo 1  i want a warm up in d1 to then see the differences in hellfire  reminder that hellfire is non canon and has nothing to do with the actual diablo storyline  not a problem for me want to see the combat and what they have for me to fight
  ahhh my bad i thought this was your first play through  hellfire is different i like the tilesets and maps although it isnt canon iirc liches gave me a hell of a hard time as a warrior but thats for you to have fun with   for me   diablo 123 but if im in the mood for a longer game two before 1
  i like to interject the bat gargoyle is about the same size and shape like this its not human sized it looks like you can punch it from the air  
  oh then a normal bat im not sure then some of those unique mobs are ridiculously hard
  diablo 123  same  ahhh my bad i thought this was your first play through  no problem    any stories you like to tell about it  and what was up with this bat was it a glitch or some staggering mechanic or are legendary monsters really so hardcore    do i avoid it and come back later to kill it    oh then a normal bat  yea im saying that its a bat gargoylenot gargoyle gargoyle because it has hands and feet that attack me dont know what the canon name for these things is
  it created hundreds of clones for the multiplayer/running and rerunning culture singleplayer gameplay isnt what defined the genre
  legendary mobs early game can be a huge pain in the ass because your defenses are bad/hit rating is terrible especially if you force magic early on as a warrior   do i avoid it and come back later to kill it  up to you honestly i avoided the butcher for like two extra levels because he would spank me    when i first played through diablo 1 i was about 6 or 7 years old and it scared the absolute hell out of me to progress past the church so for the longest time i farmed books and the legendary/unique bosses until i got over it the goatmen in diablo gave me a hard time as a warrior because of the constant chasing and cornering the game gave me so many nightmares as a kid but i kept coming back but i bonded with my father a lot while playing it when he got a second pc to play with me diablo was the start of my father and my bonding and i still game with him to this day who would have known
archbishop lazarus has not one but two literal semen demons    you know he nutted in them like a million times
  thanks for this story  i played d1 as a teen so no nightmares for me  also i checked the thing i was fighting apparently is named  winged fiend      however i think winged gremlin is a better description of it only not a lot of people can know what a gremlin looks like
  are you talking about the succubus  they are a memorable enemy i will always remember how they spam their magic orbs
  imagine
  yes namely the unique ones blackjade and red vex who were with lazarus i bet they had so many orgies in that lair before the hero came in and ruined it all
  the game gave me so many nightmares as a kid  i love for you to tell everyone about the exact nightmares you did have    if you can remember them or write them down
  everything was diablo related but i cant recall most of my childhood anymore good or bad unfortunately
  was it more about the normal monsters or the boss monsters
          fuck wrong with you retard
  fuck wrong with you retard  what did he mean by this
  it was more the atmosphere and story that got to me       no bully fren pls
ive been playing d1 for the first time as a warrior how the hell do i kill diablo i cant get close enough to him without getting blasted by fire
  staff of nova is a super cheese way to do it
  get a full belt and backpack of healing potions lure him away from his minions and simply duke it out until you run out of resources he wont get his apocalypse off too often once in melee
  how about you read the reply chain before calling me retard you mongolid piece of shit
what should i start the new ladder with i dont feel like rolling a sorceress im thinking of making a budget frenzy barb and being everyones bo/tank and then do hell at my own pace
    get a full belt and backpack   this i remember leaving everything in my inventory behind this includes all my gold in town and having a inventory full of healing potions    also never fight a boss around other minions
      oh and i mean literally full like there was not even 1 spot of inventory that was not a healing potion and all i did have was healing potions
  stop replying to me retard
  you can create new worlds on psx version if you save character instead of save game but its entirely possible to beat the game without creating new worlds    i replayed d1 on my psp a few years ago and i did normal and jumped straight to nightmare and beat both without creating new worlds using the save game option instead of save character always full clearing levels so i could get as much exp as possible it was a rogue so it was easy to cheese some of the harder parts with a ranged character and mostly because in my childhood i never played a rogue extensively so i wanted to give her a try and of course i jumped straight to hell after beating nightmare i left the game at caves probably level 10 or 11
  whats the matter little baby are you sad that your reddit spacing post replying to a ton of anons didnt get a reply you hoped to get thats what you get for being a place where you dont belong now go back from where you came from and never appear in these threads
  stop projecting newfaggot retard
  keep crying your post didnt get any replies other than mine delicious reddit tears
  nobodys crying but you stop posting any time
    both of you shut up
  you too
  talk shit  get hit  lalalala i cant hear you dont reply plssss my fefees  what a sad little person
  who are you quoting
  i like 2 a bunch but i find the first is still my favorite  one of my favorite items would be the dreamflange which was the best weapon for as sorcerer in the original
  can you share some video of those dream flange
  act 1 and act 2 is what i feel are the strongest parts of the game  try out the first game too
  just a pic    its a mace and it doesnt do any spectacular damage or anything but it has excellent stat bonuses which are good for the sorcerer who will at best avoid melee combat as much as possible
    the main reason dreamflange rocks so hard is because mana shield unlike energy shield in d2 directs all damage taken to mana and grants damage reduction on top of that dreamflange gives you 110 mana on its own endgame geared sorcerers easily reach over 1k mana warriors  maybe like 680 health in comparison
  not just manashield casting shit in general its just a great bonus overall
4 yellow and 2 blue laquered plates from pindle thus far    i really dont know what a nigga gotta do to get a set one
  griswolds edge
  ive been looking for tal rashas forever
  ive been trying and cant quite seem to get it to work
ctrlf remake remaster  0 results  whellp    with the coming rerelease of vanilla wow and a warcraft 3 remaster i believe blizzard will also do a diablo 3 remaster which i think has potential to be the diablo 3 we never got     what would you folks think about a d3 remasternamely just a 3d engine and/or a better coat of paint
  d2 remaster not d3
made a fun amulet
  i just want the visuals to get cleaned up like the brood war remaster and made scalable to higher resolutions maybe a couple things like walk over gold pickup and a spell bar too
  butcher    my friend and i were in junior high and wanted to start a clan with an entry challenge that you had to prove your worth by beating the butcher by leading him into a room and shooting him with a bow without being told to do so    i felt so seekret game knowledge back then
is there a point in diablo 1 that you have to start grinding better gear to progress i felt it was very well paced but now im at level 9 and im getting owned a lot more
  based  starting sorc is boring
  act 2 is great act 3 has some good stuff in it but also some which feels extra tedious
  shouldnt ever have to grind in normal play through some dungeon mobs are a super pain in the ass though try new gaming it
  classes still mattered for spells sorcerer had the fastest casting speed and could build his magic attribute the highest allowing him to easily learn the most powerful spells as well as use them the best
  trap assassin  sounds like my kind of girl
  based
    cringe
  girl
fuck duriel
  anon im really sorry but its only halfway decent _
  i said fun not decent shut the fuck up
  fun more like sad
  untwinked sp which is the way to play its better than youd expect to find in most runs id love to craft that in one of my one pass full clears although with a sorc those arent too challenging to begin with
  i take that back untwinked multiplayer is a lot more fun but how easy is it to find a friend who plays d2 in this day and age lel
  the way to play is plugy holy grail collection and leveling every character to 99 and twinking them in the process with the sickest most nastiest gear you can find
  i just find twinked runs really boring its no fun if you go from act 1 normal to instantly mowing everything down the whole game i like single pass full clear because its a way to play where you can actually still die and all you have to be a lot more creative with what you find and stuff like crafting and gambling actually matter to each his own though man id never shit on someone else for playing the way they find fun
  i dont know how long youve played d2 for but ive cleared the game on so many untwinked characters so many times that im at the point where i wanna actually collect everything and see whats the most op set up i can do with the items ive found for the level range im at    i might kill myself if i clear all difficulties untwinked one more time
  thats fair i dont have the patience for grailing but i see the appeal especially if youve played the game for a long time how far along are you or have you already completed it
  have you already completed it    no way im not even near some items are crazy rare        heres my link of this website i found the other day i thought i didnt have the patience too but one day i just felt like it and now im hooked doing 10 000 pindle runs right now
  its no fun if you go from act 1 normal to instantly mowing everything down the whole game  mostly untwinked player here i hate normal because it feels like a prelude to the actual game and theres hardly a challenge involved you just swing your singletarget attack until you unlock something good  thank god for respecs i no longer have to bank all of my skill points on the road to level 24/30
  ive cleared the game on so many untwinked characters so many times  how do you acquire a weapon in hell if youre a physical character
  runewords
  you can get through hell with a decent crafted weapon if you find the materials or you can gamble or use the cube to try to roll a decent rare or you could hope to make a budget runeword those are basically your options without a lucky unique drop
  act iii is the definition of pleb filter
necromancer and druid specializing in summoning are pretty fun until you hit diablo
    how do you craft an amulet like that never seen that color font is it a mod
      google it dummy
  durance of hate is cool though probably the best atmosphere of any d2 dungeon except maybe the tombs  tfw you hear the pitter patter of the killer dolls
  charsi gheed akara ormus jamella tyrael nihlathak
i wish id get a 4os eth thresher and one ber rune
  that level is always a left  you explored a bunch of directions it was highly unlikely to find the exit in
  that level is always a left    this isnt true
  holy shit i was skeptical at first but what the fuck is this new engine new interface you could go that far with modding d2 how did they do it so many questions and its a new thing i thought it was just old median xl    holy fuck this shit looks amazing i hope its not just the trailer being hype
doing pindle runs  want griffons  think about how im going to get a non unique diadem and complain in this very thread  literally as im finished thinking this exact thought the last fireball needed is flying towards him  dies  white diadem drops    fucking insane
  literal next run a rare laquered plate drops    guys im fucking scared
  new interface  trivial to change diablo 2 flat out lets you edit the interface with softcoding  high resolution  the high resolution patch has been around for ages  bigger inventory  babbys first mod changing a few values in a txt makes this happen  individual cooldowns  the code edit has been around for more than a decade first time i remember seeing it was in the ragnarok mod  map reveal  very easy this is already built into the game  new hotkeys  been around for years all the code edits required are already described so all you have to do is copy and paste  notifications  probably just took this from the dreamlands mod tool  no death penalty  change one column in difficultytxt  automatic pickups  probably just taking the automatic gold pickup mod which has been around for years    the numxl guys are a bunch of hacks they just amalgamate other peoples work all of the changes they made could be done by a completely new modder in a few days time
  i know about most of these but them saying new engine got me wired up are they just sugar coating things up i usually hate on mods but that trailer looks sick i cant lie
  are they just sugar coating things up  not exactly from a players perspective these are all significant changes that greatly change how the game works from a modders perspective this is just copy and pasting other peoples work calling it a new engine is complete bullshit though making a few already known and defined changes in the game files is definitely not new and it only results in tiny almost negligible changes in how the engine works
  i see i actually modded my pluggy a good amount by reading guides on the phrozen keep but got excited when i read new engine i thought they programmed that shit from scratch and just used d2 assets
  i thought it was just old median xl  not knowing the meme that is sigma     map reveal large inventory high res and autopick up have been a thing for years on mxl   sigma is a complete overhaul of the d2 engine the video doesnt show off shit its just to show off mxl to people who dont know about the mod
  sigma is a complete overhaul of the d2 engine    so its legit and im allowed to be hyped
  kindaish this more like the open beta with sigma they will be able to add in a lot stuff so hopefully its just mxl but less clunky       if youve never played mxl give it try now on single player if you like it wait a month and hop on ladder
  i think ill just hop fresh on the ladder when its out are they doing a 3 month ladders like a certain garbage mod or
non eth superior 4os thresher drops    bitchass faggot game fuck off aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  non eth giant thresher drops literally next run    this is some gayass bullshit
  how hard is it to do some coop dialbo 1 is there a tutorial or guide for a brainlet
is it fine to play bezelbub as a first playthrough for getting into the series theres some annoying stuff like it not saving location on saves but other than that it seems manageable stretched 43 full screen just looks awful on my monitor so i wanna use this mod unless im missing something by not playing vanilla
what runeword should i use on a fendazon going into hell difficulty
  it did and the clones are better now at least for single player  d2lod online is an experience that has been never replicated or truly improved upon and once youve played it online youll search for 20 years for a game that replicates the experience and still not find one
  what are some memorable personalities from d2  tyrael  you
  not even
  i liked this from a story perspective  never post here again
  use your cube
  on the one hand you are absolutely right  on the other hand seething
  19 fcr is such a fucking cockblock why cant it be 20 fucking faggot game man
  you do know that some people like to fullclear zones right
  do you know that autism is real    yes nobody said otherwise
    agree but nice one tho 
  what is a fendazon 
two lacquered plates in a row from pindle  neither is green
  not like it matters an extra 1 fcr wouldnt hit the next breakpoint in that build
tfw hadnt played diablo ii in over a year   heard about diablo immortal  fuck it fired up d2 again   have been playing every single day for the past few weeks    just when i thought i was out they pull me back in
  if it makes you feel any better  i still have never found a soj
  fun is what she is   that is if you can get your hands on 2/3slvl 5/6 socket zon spears
  stop trying to put words in my mouth you fucking retard have you never tried a magic find build you think skipping zones will get you items what a fucking brainlet
  they  the ones that made the game are gone anon
  never post here again  can you elaborate on this  adria turning out to be evil is a dark twist and i like it for it  also did you ever play d1  she never felt like a good person and there was a certain darkness about her    also while playing d1 i noticed this    the witch adria is an anomaly here in tristram she arrived shortly after the cathedral was desecrated while most everyone else was fleeing she had a small hut constructed at the edge of town seemingly overnight and has access to many strange and arcane artifacts and tomes of knowledge that even i have never seen before    she arrived shortly after the cathedral was desecrated while most everyone else was fleeing  she arrived shortly after the cathedral was desecrated while most everyone else was fleeing    hut constructed at the edge of town seemingly overnight  hut constructed at the edge of town seemingly overnight  seemingly overnight  seemingly overnight    and has access to many strange and arcane artifacts and tomes of knowledge that even i have never seen before   knowledge that even i have never seen before   knowledge that even i have never seen before    makes you think if it was planned in d1 from the start
  i was the same until i did however many bugged nm andy runs best place to get tals ammy and an soj doesnt take that long too
  you are easily the worst poster on 4chan ive seen all year stop replying to me youre disgusting
  cant refute the argument  the irony of a worst poster
  no point in arguing with a literal autist that doesnt know a thing about diablo 2
  are you speaking to a mirror right now because the one who doesnt know a thing about the game is you keep the adhominem since that seems to be the only thing you know
  adhominem    how ironic considering your first post here 
  yeah i talk about irony for you assuming stuff and the logical leap from there is for you to obviously do the same since you cant think about stuff yourself were here to discuss diablo games if you cant do that then fuck off
  youre not discussing anything just projecting and throwing insults around again how ironic
                can you two lovers go to /b/ and have this debate there everyone else would like to have a talk about the game diablo 1 and 2  thank you
  before i go you have to answer which one is better 1 or 2
   im not the one who started trading insults with you fyi  personally i prefer d1 for its compacts1 town to know and dark story however others are free to disagree
  im not the one who started trading insults with you fyi    thats about to change because 2 is way better than 1 you dumdum head
  one of the most pointless characters in existence imagine a melee skill that hits everything in proximity once very slowly forcing you to kill in the slowest and least safe possible way now imagine this skill was also pseudouninterruptible meaning it will finish its animation but will do nothing if you are in hit recovery dodging or blocking so it is actually worse than if you were just regular interruptible fend and sacrifice share the same special position of being the only attack skills worse than normal attack
  started playing it when i was 10 years old only stopped when i was 20 playing modded nowadays i dont really care much the whole point of the game was grinding forever for better gear to grind with
  nobody asked
  my post had both adhominem because youre assuming stuff out of the blue to fit your narrative and discussion about full clearing zones yours have only one of these 2 guess whos the ironic retard now
  release sigma already you lazy fucks  i just checked the page and its gonna be in january 2019 holy shit i never thought theyd actually release the thing    hows it going to be
  yes and
  quit bitching autist
act ii was the best and thats final

  diablo devs made the poe team
  chris wilson producer/developer  david brevik advisor  i know for sure from blizz north old team
  i can understand the nostalgic allure of wanting to pick up d2 again in all this mess but the game is dated if you want something that feels like diablo that isnt blizzard poe is free to download on steam    some pointers the art looks like more of a spiritual sequel to diablo than any other clone without being a clone lots of quality of life updates in ui animation graphics sound    the community is thriving and dedicated    the game took more than a couple days for me to complete all ten acts im still not max level 69/100 and starting end game maps    its not grinding all the same maps/rifts map drops and end map bosses along with daily quests crafting and trade currencies trading is viable    cash shop isnt a money grab primarily only cosmetic and quality of life the base game is very playable without anything off the cash shop    im not getting paid to say this shit i also picked up grim dawn and would suggest that as a fallout/diablo hybrid    there are new games worth playing dont give blizz your money theyve been fucking their fanbase and im sick of it thats all im really trying to say
  what the fuck
  what
  i didnt mean theyre gone from the industry i meant that he cant say something like they pull me back in as if the creators of immortal and d2 are the same
  autism
  ah its the nobody asked autist from the old general
  see 
    jesus christ will this thread be fucked up by this shitposting  mods
  i mean you could choose to reply to any of the on topic posts or make your own post but instead you dont
yet again the autism train derails the diablo thread bravo fuckos
  keeps crying instead of posting any diablo 2 oc or starting a discussion
  full clearing zones is autism  proceeds to do boss and pindle runs over and over
  yes because im not autistic and want to actually be rewarded for my time played instead of not getting any items
  fuckos  if you were in these threads long enough youll know its just one faggot repeatedly doing it
  pretty sure autism is tied to doing the same thing again and again but right on lets ignore that because it breakes your narrative apart
  unlike you im not autistic so i wouldnt know for sure but in this case its implied that its doing the same thing again and again without getting good results which is what full clearing zones is
  ok i posted this  arguably the last diablo post in here before a wall of text of shitposting anyone want to talk about it was adria planed to worship diablo from he start  also the walls of shitposting obscure the actually important posts i was ignoring it until it became impossible to ignore and the shitposting was unbearable  thank you
  two its two
  yes anon im also sure that repeating youre not autistic over and over will one day make it a reality hopefully you can cure yourself out of it
  well i cant help you there because im not too invested in the lore but ive made multiple gameplay related posts and you didnt reply to any of them
  no argument    thats what i thought
  im not too invested in the lore  nobody asked
  see 
  reddit spacing  thats what i thought
  no its ok bro im done whats your favorite act and your favorite pvm character my dude
  muh reddit obsession    ok redditor
  cool lets keep talking about the games and hope the shitposters dont go full retard once more
  was adria planed to worship diablo from the start  ok we all know d3 is not canon however adria becoming corrupted like everyone else does make sense well minus cain
  ok post your grail list and hopefully the actual autist takes his medicine or leaves
  funnily enough the one youre replying to is the shitposter
 if you dont like diablo youre free to leave the thread
5194604  follow the chain of replies and youll see whos the one who doesnt like diablo and is obsessed with the word autism
 you
reminder stop playing vanilla and start playing mxl
  only when the new thing releases in january
  hmm i mean after playing d1 once more this line was a awakening call for me and her betrayal in d3 was feeling like something planned from the start  i mean we have someone coming overnight into a town who everyone is leaving strange at the minimum and her hut was simply instantly established and on the same day when the raiders attacked the cathedral    i think its really easy to make the conclusion that adria worked for diablo and demons of diablo build her hut while they where desecrating the cathedral  she also has knowledge of things who are unknown to cain possibly demonic in origin    i mean its beneficial to have a spy in the town who can report to diablo if things are not going to plan her knowing that diablo will poses whoever kills him explains why she did not try to stop the encounter/fight with diablo    i think this line of text sticks out if you look into it however its easy to overlook and think nothing of it  i think this was planned from the start or am i reading things into this it really was a wtf moment of realization during my play of d1 once more    do you think its me reading things into the text of d1  or has bliz folders for future development of their characters  or did someone at bliz remember this line and decided to spin a story from it like some fan fiction only canon  or was this element planned for a expansion of d1 or even d2 however never materialized and was reworked into d3    what do you think
has anyone played resurgence im seeing a few dudes stream it but im not sure looks kind of weird
  just use thawing potions and hes not really a problem
    remember this friday boys

  i think summoners are kind of fun for a while and then get really boring it doesnt help that necros are the only ones that can do it right
  i think summoners are kind of fun for a while and then get really boring  i think you need the right mindset for them the fun about summoners is that they have tools to handle every encounter you just have to use more curses than amp and decrep poorman untwinked necro thats on hardcore and has to juggle curses for every given occasion can be a tense experience even if its babbys first guardian plus one fun thing about summoners is that their entire build is finished at level 51 or so rs  sm  ce at 20 so if youre bored you can go get something like mass revives or a nicely synergized bone spear/bone wall
  poorman untwinked necro thats on hardcore and has to juggle curses for every given occasion can be a tense experience  this i always put one point into each curse for various encounters
  summoner  full blown fucking hiv positive g a y like were talking i let freddie mercury fuck me in the ass and now i a have permanent prolapsed anus and my colon is rotting away in the aids ward gay    real niggas necros run dagger/explosionmancer not some faggy ass pansy that lets mr bones and friends fights for him because hes to chicken shit to tank some damage
  edgy
  it doesnt help that necros are the only ones that can do it right  just mod the druid so that he can have all summons at once makes him go from garbage to fun or even better increase the limit on shadow masters/warriors from 1 to 1 per 5 levels
zelda ii doesnt immediately follow loz the world is just too different
  immediately  considering link is a child in the first and a teenager in the second of course it doesnt you goof
  zelda 2 just shows more of the same world
  hundreds of years have likely passed
  huh
  based fuck casuals
  links adventure  loz  fight me  im old enough to remember being hyped for lttps release
  so why did ganon hide all pieces of the triforce in such a small area
  so hyrule castle in alttp is dungeon 2 from zelda 1 thats pretty cool
  the lost woods in zelda 1 does not line up with how it is in zelda 3 also i always assumed the lake in the center of zelda 1 was lake hylia but i actually cannot find any proof of that so i guess i am wrong
  the world is just too different  thats because it mostly takes place north of death mountain in an area the manual calls death valley      hundreds of years have likely passed  the manual explicitly states its the same link and zelda from the first game so only a handful of years have passed at most
  does zelda ii have a bigger world than botw
  op you are a clown
zelda timeline autism is retarded  i guarantee nintendo never cared about the continuity of zelda in the beginning and they barely care now it doesnt fucking matter
  nintendo cared more about it in the early days than they ever do now you monkey zelda ii directly follows from zelda i alttp is clearly established as a prequel to both with links awakening being its direct sequel oot is the direct prequel to all of the above its simple its when nintendo licensed spinoffs to third parties or inhouse development groups that continuity problems started
  if it was a prequel was the link in alttp the same link in zelda 1
  was the link in alttp the same link in zelda 1  no and thats confirmed in oot when ganondorf says hell come back to seek revenge on zelda and links descendants thats when we knew that unless the game explicitly states its the same link then its a different one
  read the manual you retarded faggot
  so why did ganon hide all pieces of the triforce  you need to leave
  no
    thank you im tired of people not getting why people were concerned about the timeline in the first place every game had a clear place relative to one another up until the oracles
  to be fair the oracles could easily be between alttp and la
  so did link hook up with zelda in oot and their greatgreatgrandchildren hooked up with each other in zelda 1 incest ftw
  im glad they didnt go with the kanto as one city idea if it were two adjacent towns it might work but otherwise its just a bizarre approach
  two people can have descendants without having them with each other you know
  isnt the cursed zelda in zelda 2 not the one from the original
    even oracles had a clear place the linked games end on a raft and la starts with link on a raft pretty much every game placement makes sense
  nope different princess
  what does this picture convey
  in the beta for gold/silver it turned out gamefreaks original intent was to have the game take place over the whole of japan so the kanto region as we know it would be represented as a large town
  the leaked beta for pokemon 2 included the map from the original game but physically scaled down to suggest that the world in the sequel is much bigger    in the final game they did reuse pokemon red/blues world map but it was the same size as the first game
change change change     does anyone else still carry this little gem around in their heart it feels really special to me  that retrofuturistic world with all the crazy characters jobs radio stations and general tone is just wonderful and lots of fun the controls may be something you have to get used to but even they are fun for me  i only played the shitty psx version for many years of my late childhood only in my later teens did i get back at it and tried the pc version for the first time and boy was it a difference   it only made me love this game even more its so simple neat and nicely packed    so whats your opinion on this game the first one can be discussed too of course but i only played it once after gta2 and never liked it too crude  also post your favorite  map  weapon  car  radio station  gang  character  mission    by the way i remember playing it about two years ago but i didnt have to change my tv to 16 bit colors like i have to now in order to play the game is there any fix for that     yaki taki teriyaki  yaki taki teriyaki  teri is so merry  yaki is so happy  teriyaki
  is there any fix for that  play the pc version also gta3 and beyond is not gta
  play the pc version  i am of course    also gta3 and beyond is not gta  certainly not in the way the first ones were crime drama story fits it more i guess  that again is the simplicity i love about gta2 youre just some lousy crook who wants to make big money and fast no family no personal friends just you money gang bosses their respect and the cops
pcgw may help with 16bit i dunno i cannot be bothered to look but if if you dont know about pcgw its about blow ya mind google insert game name here pcgw
  google gta1max if you wann experience a comfy version for gta1 on modern pcs
  i played 1 before this and remember how great it was as a sequel same game just everything was so much better three things that stick out  loonies  the amount of possible exploration so many rooftops walkways etc to lob grenades off  taxi drivers must die
  reminder that the cover of midnight club has a whole entire story behind it which at the time was happening in 1999 rockstar was producing kino back in the day fucking mad men closed down new york city  
  map  honestly dont remember    weapon  molotov/grenade because of the flying glitch    car  ztype    radio station  tsunami fm    gang  zaibatsu corporation    character  me/claude    mission  dont remember
  molotov/grenade because of the flying glitch  go on
  it suggested a widescreen fix which i applied darn way better know thanks      ill keep that in mind
  ah yeah i forgot this was never documented    if you run off of a rooftop while continuously throwing a grenade or molotov youll keep that elevation until you stop throwing the weapon you can get to some weird places with it
  just tried it didnt work for me probably got fixed somewhere along the way
  try the playstation version if you can
  playstation version is superior for a single playthrough anyway some of the kill quotas in missions are shorter making the game a lot less tedious    and yes that is important you can tell they started to run out of ideas for missions because some of them repeat themselves as the game continues
very neat game dreamcast version is awesome as well im surprised there isnt more of a cult following behind this considering the wild success of the gta3 but you know millenials and onwards and how they think of 2d i agree exactly with you about the first one  it was just a bit too crude while this one was perfect thats it theres just something different about the 2d world here that in some way makes it fun at least for variety hey maybe there should be a new 2d gta game in this style or even an updated style but has to be 2d a kickstarter or something
  you have to jump then do it
  but you know millenials and onwards and how they think of 2d  millenials were the kids who played gta on psx you mong
  the theoretical academic meaning is different to how it has been used online the point is i wasnt inclined to say zoomers because there are plenty of mature people significantly older than zoomers so i just said millenials
  meh most of the repeated missions are in the industrial district anyway theres still a surprising amount of variety for such an early game in the series though    
  loonies  i love them too their radio station with dj spaz funbags is just brilliant im on their last mission right now the gang war their territory and base is also pretty comfy      ill try that later      i play through the first two districts normally doing every mission available in the third i mostly cheat and just enjoy the wack
  gta3  gta 3 was still a game in the same vein as 1 and 2 it wasnt until vc and sa it turned into meme fests
elvis has just left the building
  damnation no donation no salvation
it was a lot of fun i think gta 2 and gta 5 have some great gameplay  vice city seems like it could work in 2d as well    good gta 2 remix      map  i liked most of them the residential one with the prison and rv park are most memorable  weapon  taser  car  ztype  radio station  funami fm and lithium fm  gang  zaibatsu
happy birthday boris  he got game and a cake  boris boris sell the game eat the cake
  does anyone else still carry this little gem around in their heart it feels really special to me  same    map  residential district the 2nd map is by any means the best one i could go hours telling how genius map design it is  weapon  rocket launcher sending people to the air is just fun  car  furore gt  radio station  lithium fm  gang  rednecks  mission  prison mission taxi remote driving
it is amazing how much stuff they put in those 1215 minute loops                  dean frantz i tell you cops theyre everywhere these days iii cant walk down the street without someone asking me for my id some men in blue telling me who are you im dean frantz i dont need to show you my id i mean cops everywhere but is there ever a cop when you need one no
    but it only worked in the demo version of gta2    though a leftover of the glitch still exists allowing you to avoid detection in certain cases
  ive played it so much that it got dull since i did everything there was to do played it in my childhood where getting a tank and driving around with it was the best fun ever then i played it some more when i was older and actually did all the missions including the final one in every map the only things i havent done is pass all the kill frenzies and gather all the gta2 signs  the best part those voiced messages that pop up on the screen when you do something crazy insane stunt bonus    map  the first one commercial district dunno why i like it so much the 2nd one is better in many ways  weapon  flamethrower  car  btype  radio  kgbh  gang  zaibatzu  mission  the redneck one where you blow up an outhouse
  and the final release of the psx and pc version
  teriyaki make a me so honry  teriyaki make a me so ronry  teriyaki is so ungay  teriyaki does it all day  haki teriyaki
really good thread op i remember playing it with my cousin a lot but the details went away so i wont be able to answer all of your questions  map  i only remember the first map we would always just fuck around  weapon  this lightning gun it was fun  car  police car really liked the design  radio station  sorry dont remember any  gang  the yakuza  character   dont have one  mission  dont have one
i think everyone agrees that residential is the best in terms of content    although i like the industiral districts aesthetic better it really feels like a seedy shithole
i remember i had this gta2 book for the pc version it had all sorts of information listed every vehicle and its stats weapons maps and tons of information in general   it was also full of artwork like pic related a swat cop with the electro baton that was in the beta version sadly i can only find a few pictures from that book i really wish i still had it it was really nicely made up  i still remember the picture of a redneck sitting on some crudely put together toilet with a shotgun
  just found a video that pretty much depicts all the concept art i can find  
any immersion is immediately killed when the cops appear and can find you everywhere it ruined every gta for me from a later perspective if they dont manage to implement a proper ki and nonlinear mission design the bigger and more detailed the sandbox gets the more inanimate and lifeless it gets
  yeah i really hate how hard cops rubberband you in 2
industrial for the comfy futuristic dystopian aesthetic residental for the diverse environments and the content mobile home park gated community dense inner city area with tall buildings and skybridges corporate fortresses everywhere etc     downtown is pretty bland desu its the least futuristic of the districts and its not very diverse funami is top comf though
aww yeah gta2 ive played ps1 version first years later i got it for pc when it was available for free on rockstars website i remember being blown away how much better lightning and effects were it also had multiplayer which was somewhat fun anyone else tried it    also remember that one mission i think it was for the loonies where you had to destroy zaibatsu cars only using your own car ive done every fucking mission in the game except that one
  pretty much sums up my gta2 experience    i remember being blown away how much better lightning and effects were  glorious wasnt it i was really astonished it added so much to the feeling and atmosphere    ive done every fucking mission in the game except that one  not the loonies i just finished their missions sure does sound like one hell of a mission though i was having trouble with one of the last zaibatsu missions im on right now  had to destroy two or three special armored yakuza cars but nothing i did would destroy them found out you can only get them with car bombs    never tried multiplayer though but i recently watched some videos and it looked pretty fucking wild and fun
  its an arcadish style game where the game spawns cops to be killed or kill you/arrest you its not trying to be realistic
  are you talking about armored cars clash     that one is a piece of shit since the only thing that damages the armored cars is a car bomb
  chinatown wars is top down modern gta with the first two islands from 4 good game
map  residential district by far   cool as beans scripted sequence at the start with a redneck killing a scientist only to be driven over by a zaibatsu car   fbi shows up a properly new threat since you already know about the army from map 1   even still you get to invoke the army in that one tank stealing mission   the metro   everything about the scientists and their zany shit   secret wang cars bonus   the coolest missions by far    weapon  molotovs cocktails were fun as shit    car  1 fbi car  2 benson  3 dementia    radio station  funami made my peepee hard as an impressionable teen    gang  1 srs  2 loonies  3     character  not sure    mission  1 penal ties  2 swat van swipe  3 water carry on
    gta2 was my favorite in the series by far partly due to such comedy      i loved vice citys aesthetics transplanting that into gta2 as a new level/expansion could be amazing especially with gta2s beautiful lighting i only ever played the pc version
fun fact  ez rollers weekend world also provided the intro and menu music for another sequel in toca touring car championship 2 
rockstar used to give gta 12 for free a few years ago on their websitthey stopped doing that when gta5 was released and jews took over
throwback to this bad boy
  they probably didnt feel like supporting them anymore the windows port of 1 is especially unstable    i wonder were the radio stations lower quality on the downloadable versions      better than the base game if you ask me
  yep i downloaded 2 back then pretty based from them  you can find them everywhere anyway its abandonware and rockstar doesnt care probably dont want to waste bandwidth though
  i wonder why they had this deal with moving shadow when only 2 tracks from the label showed up in gta2
  better than the base game if you ask me  it had better designed missions had an actual narrative and was a lot less punishing than gta1 its loads better    better than gta2 as well but i think most will disagree with me
  does anyone else still carry this little gem around in their heart  i do being able to actually choose the gang to run with was cool the missions were fun flamethrower firetruck now thats what i call a mission and the style was not something you see every day it wasnt without big flaws though
  what would you say are the biggest flaws
suddenly have no more radio music  check online  apparently an unknown issue  finally check volume settings  music turned down all the way
    car bomb    that would make sense no idea why i didnt try that one in the past i just kept trying to ram them which is fools errand if i recall correctly the mission is timed so no way in hell can you do it by just smacking those cars around    never tried multiplayer though but i recently watched some videos and it looked pretty fucking wild and fun  it kind of wasi even took part in some gang ladder organized by a small community where everyone chose one of the ingame gangs to represent they organized some duels and team matches between members of different gangs i was in rednecks fun times    amyway rocket launcher sniping was more or less meta to be fair all weapons that werent rocket launcher zapgun flamethrower and maybe molotovs were useless
  the only grand theft auto game rated t
  that would make sense no idea why i didnt try that one in the past i just kept trying to ram them which is fools errand if i recall correctly the mission is timed so no way in hell can you do it by just smacking those cars around  yeah you get around five minutes to blow up two cars the mission ended up being rather easy the first car spawns right around the corner of a garage so you can hit the target and quickly get another car to rig up  was kinda lost myself when i emptied my rocket launcher and then my flamethrower at it but nothing worked    i also just realized that i have to start over because ill miss the last mission which only triggers if you did every mission of every gang in downtown   i started a new game after i finished all missions for a gang so i dont have to put up with that big ass arrow all the time i shouldve just burned all the money by saving the first time around oh well    that gang ladder multiplayer thing sounds pretty fun but i was never quite a fan of multiplayer games
want to collect some gta badges weapons and do some kill frenzies after the first mission so i have enough gear and money collected for a nice save   end up going on for quite a while because its fun  stop at the yakuza jlab for some more rocket launcher ammo  walk backwards to get off the crates  land on the foot of the other crates and glitch underground  have to redo all the shit  you finally get into it and good again then the game says fuck you and shoves a suzie up your ass like this
  yeah it has some serious collision problems sometimes especially if you fall on some kind of ledge
  yep have had that happen to me multiple times another common one is somehow ending up inside some building or crate with no way to get out happens especially often near the car crushers since you have to jump a lot to get to the belt  the only workaround is to save often
  gta 3 is a step down from this game besides being in third person easily one of the best gta titles  map  residental district because its fun as fuck glitching into the prison also has the best gangs and overall just like the variety  weapon  electrogun dual pistols or silenced machine gun  car  ztype or furore gt so glad they brought these two cars back into gta 5  radio station  dont remember the radio much  gang  elvis impersonators  character  gimme your wallet  mission  probably the mission you do for the rednecks where you intentionally get sent to jail and disguise as a prison guard then cause a prison riot
what does those gta symbols do anyway
    i guess ill be more careful and not dick around too much inbetween saves      ztype or furore gt  right about now the wellard is my favorite sure it got shitty armor but the speed and the way it controls are great fun  also just discovered that the spraynpaint shops in gang controlled areas paint your car in the gangs color thats cool      each district of anywhere usa contains 50 hidden badges many badges are difficult to reach or find when you collect all badges in a district you will be rewarded with a bonuslevel gta2 badges are the first hidden packages of gta
  
finish mission by parking vehicle in a garage  get thrown on the curb and walk on the street to get a car   some schmidt driving motherfucker crashes into me   lay on the road  no worries just a crash  proceeds to drive a little forwards  wasted  same mission same outcome twice even the same fucking car with different paintjob schmidt drivers must die
  finish mission by parking vehicle in garage  spawn inside the garage and get stuck  this shit always happens with that one mission in downtown
  car bombing road blocks felt like an action flick
  havent had that happen to me yet finished all the missions except some yakuza ones but now i dread that moment
head  radio in the mornin  head  radio in the evenin toooo
  i really didnt get into the radio stations of the residential zone yet   it was just too fun to listen to the loonies lithium fm station with the insane stuff of spaz funbags while driving over some peds on the way to a missions destination  the map is also hell to memorize
gang car bang mission  i just cant fucking finish it and when some guy in a video does it it looks easy as fuck i either get blown up in a car or burned by flamethrowers  also the rednecks coming with me dont have any weapons
  gta3 could be a legit gta only if you play it with the right camera angle
i wish rockstar could make a new gta in 2d  i like the 3d games but the 2d ones are comfy as fuck
  i certainly wish theyd dig up that retrofuturistic setting again
  gta1max  does it fix the shaky camera that makes me puke now that im an adult
  whats different between the psx and pc versions
  the psx version has worse graphics and less stuff on the screen at once trains and power ups are missing but due to lesser spawns you have to kill fewer people in some missions  theres probably a good comparison to find on google or whatever
  psx version is set during daytime because the psx cant handle the lighting effects iirc it doesnt have trains either furthermore the ui takes up to much of the game screen
ehhh for those saying gta2 is 2d gta2 is a 3d game with top down perspective      you mean a slight movement of the car/camera cant remember which in some cars when youre driving fast      too many even the ai acts differently
  its a flat plane though like the above view contra levels
  slight  first time a video game made me sick weird thing is i didnt mind it at all as a child couldnt play for more than 5 minutes now i wish it had camera from the second game
  ah nope i was talking about something else that camera zooming in and out when you change your speed is always there doesnt get me dizzy at all though
so if i already have the playstation version is there any reason other than graphical upgrade to get the dreamcast version i keep finding mixed reports online about the differences
  a flat plane  how can it be a flat plane when there are altitude levels that directly affect the physics of the game cars explode from falling you die when you jump off buildings the distance of throwing grenades is affected by altitude the train travels on another level of altitude than traffic wtf
top kek
  hol up  theres something fucky with your respect how did you get one so high without making another drop car crusher respect tokens
  yeah caused a little ruckus by one of the cranes in scientist territory right by the street   i was hoping to get them all up because i was tired of getting shot to shit in missions but for some reason only the scientists respect reacted also started to run the invincibility cheat  call me a scrub but its more fun to me at this point no idea how people got through penal ties regulary with all those other crooks beating your ass up i always ended up wasted sooner or later and got fed up with it
  each of the gangs has their own crane and you get respect for the gang whose territory you do the crushing in  penal ties is the prison mission right iirc i did it by memorizing where i have to go and then just ran as fast as you can took a few tries i think
  each of the gangs has their own crane and you get respect for the gang whose territory you do the crushing in  must be different in the psx version saw a video of a guy who did the exact same thing at the exact same crane and all his respect got pushed up    penal ties is the prison mission right  yeah exactly the guards seemed to be at different places every time except for one right after getting the cop uniform and gun   really fun mission though i wish i made a video of the cops nailing you as you enter the billy bean liquor car some gorgeous play with the lighting there
also what the fuck is with the arachnid car you can push bank vans around like theyre toys drive full speed and no car will stop you until you go up in flames
this thread inspired me to give this game another go  id forgotten how much fun it is to do the loony missions which is what i decided to start with blowing shit up left and right radio stations pizza places cop stations jlab the latter gtas dont quite capture the insane mayhem as well as this game i have to admit that gta 5 is far superior cruising game if all you want to do is drive around listen to the radio and watch stuff drift by
  you just have to shoot everyone during penal ties    also i hate that the alt key respawns prisoners
  the first map really was a lot of fun i had two whole radio stations i liked the loonies were just great as a gang in the second map i have taxi drivers must die and maybe two other songs i like  the comfy downtown setting with the crazy gangs was a good contrast      i tried the mission multiple times with different approaches i just couldnt nail it
  gtavcopswebm
so many great memories with this game
the worlds on fire man  when you swallow down that lithium
whats the best versions of gta1 and 2 and if theyre the pc versions anyone have a download
  unfinished  modder hasnt posted since 2015
  gta1  gta max pack
i had a 5 minutes demo i played to death you could do anything finding the tank included but the game closed after 5 minutes i think i played it more than the full game that i got just some years after
  camera zooms in and out too fast when stopped so when hitting traffic it can change height like crazy plus the game really lacks minimap strafing and/or mouse control hotline miami scheme would be ideal and iirc it was already implemented in the likes of take no prisoners and mageslayer  looking back i shouldnt have called those big flaws
  the game really lacks minimap strafing and/or mouse control  hotline miami scheme would be ideal  no it would completely break the games balance    why do people even wish for an originally good game to be completely different
  watching the camera wobble in just this short webm makes me feel sick how did they let that pass even back then
  only big change id want is the ability to turn off the aim assist in gta2
i remember my dad took me to target to get gta1 and a dualshock controller for ps1 we saw that there was a gta2 so he bought me that instead i still have both and this is still my favorite gta
  strafing and/or mouse control  this lack is intended though it imposes realistic vulnerability on the player implementing these features would make the player ridiculously powerful compared to the other characters    minimap  completely unecessary as the game encourages you to memorise landmarks and using them to navigate a minimap would only serve as unrealistic handholding
  minimap  besides what you mentioned i find it very easy to memorize the maps at least the first two havent been to the industrial district yet   thought the residential area would be hell to memorize from looking at the map in downtown you had that big ass street rectangle right in the middle which helped a lot but nothing of that kind in residential  but no problem after a few missions
  putting all bad radio on trial its judge and jury fanny jo styles
  the sprites are truly flat with z offsets but the map is 2d textures on 3d grid
  little side note  for gta 2 on the ps1 if you plug in a second controller you can use it to modify each individual respect meter to your liking
  the maps are entirely 3d  picture related gta 2 seems popular for porting attempts to other engines
  this is neat
  im sad this project was never updated or that someone never at least made a simple doom map out of it
  i wonder how the driving and collisions would even work in this
    i love gta2 and have a youtube playlist that is nothing but this 10 hour loop of the menu theme    pc version even had multiplayer would play it a lot with my friend irl  also yeah i liked london 1969 a lot but gta2 is easily the best one and it would be nice to have a top down view spiritual successor  anyway  residential district  electrogun  ice cream van / icecream truck  taxi drivers must die   all of them but probably ziabatsu or loonies  claude speed of course if that doesnt count then trey welsh  im bored so im starting a gang war
just looked for a video of all the weapon pickup announces a shame apparently nobody has done it wanted to ask you guys for the favorite  honestly theyre all great but i really like grenades rocket launcher molotov cocktail and machine gun
  flaaaamethrower
  i really do love the way the guy says rocket launcher and machine gun
  tfw no hd transfer of the original 35mm material
the announcer in gta2 gives me some interesting vibes the way he announces your actions and the applause on your entrance and mission success creates a futuristic tv show feel similar to smash tv i guess this ties neatly with the implied verynearfuturedystopian aesthetic
  thats fucking neato always wondered where the screenshots of the game menus came from also that guy looks like the dude from gta3
  maybe in 2019    oh wait they dont care about this game anymore
it dont matter  when we get there  the fun just started at the side of the road      its the same dude they at least share a first name
  thats a neat thought it does feel like a tv show with the cam following you from above
gta 2 was the fucking bomb  but have u guys played payback      also best song in the game was made by a guy who is as crazy as the universe gta2 is set in  
  sorry but that looks and sounds like shit
  ive been trying to find the amiga version to emulate for years now
  that looks like gta1 on some crazy loony drug
  didnt they actually name the camera system the oj cam in the manual for the first game
  apparently the gta wiki says so  in the manuals of the first two games it is called oj cam  very cool find man just laughed my ass off how much better can this game get
love the game 3 and onwards just doesnt feel the same the exception being chinatown wars which feels more like old gta than not     i also love the driving in this game it feels a bit like playing micro machines
insane stunt bonus worthy
  i think theres a quasi remake turned into a battle royale on steam
  i think there was a patch to change it from 5 mins to unlimited
  never knew amiga had poly 3d games
is anybody able to upload their save file if theyve unlocked all the areas they seem to be hard to find on google
  for gta2
  this one i guess  
  thank you youre a good person
  no problem
  just another power machine on the freeway
so what mods are good for this its been years since i played this so ive forgotten with age was it much of a mod scene i vaguely recall liking those level mods that were just giant islands with ramps and shit where youd just jump tanks and cars
  i was looking for something too but only found maps vehicle replacements and so on wouldve loved something like running around as doomguy in a doom style map with demons or whatever  apparently this one isnt too bad   block fort frag meme is one of the craziest mods with rainbow explosions and many weird things   but so far im pretty happy with just the widescreen patch and that gta2reg powerpatch
is it arcade the nes version maybe even the game boy version there so many ports of tetris and i dont know why the nes version gets so much attention does anyone know which version is the best
  there are so many good versions that there is no best version its down to preference personally i like both the nes and snes ones the gameboy one feels a little sluggish in comparison
tengenjust because of the coop
  original xbox the one that came with star wars attack of the clones
  worlds was absolute dogshit
snes  tetris absolute grand master 2
  ti84 because its the one i played the most and that is all that the answers in this thread will amount to
  nullpomino customize ruleset and settings to your liking
  im playing the nes version and its very good plus all the big tournaments use the nes version so might as well play it in case you break a world record
  this  and the dancing little russkies
  is there a reason why all the big tournaments use the nes version
  probably because of jeff      and because its the definitive version classic tetris tournaments are played on that same version of nintendo tetris using original nes game systems controllers and tetris cartridges
this is a really good matchup  
  acid tetris its not canon but that was a fun demo back in the day
nes tetris tgm if you want something thats easier but that looks much more difficult to impress normies
  gameboy had the best soundtrack but nes had the sharper look and feel regardless its all up to personal preference
  i dont know why the nes version gets so much attention    because lots of people had the nes
not gonna lie the nes version receiving so much attention than the superior sega tetris arcade triggers my autism a little bit
  
    do you have any rerelease/repro/bootleg retro games in your collection or just first editions
  ninja gaiden 3 subs when
as a third worlder i have a ton of nes repros i had as a kid
  i have never owned a repro but i am interested in taiwanese and korean retro bottlegs
lately ive found out that yoiko hamaguchi and arino partecipated on some interesting shit most of all that one show where they were in a deserted place and needed to survive i wish i could watch that subbed somewhere
watch arino play comix zone  aw yeah i should play that again why did i never finish it  start playing get to the first boss  hit him until he goes high go under to the right get the barrel push it under him  suddenly it glitches me ontop of the barrel and pushes both me and the barrel to the left  health goes from nearly full to empty instantly  everytime i play comix zone this always happens then i remember why i stopped playing not this exact instance but something always glitches or gets funky or doesnt work the way its supposed to i honestly wouldnt be surprised if the glitch arino encountered wasnt caused by the age of the hardware dont even get me started on the hit detection issues in this game
arino in smash when
  im fairly sure that show is subbed theres a surprising amount of random japanese comedy stuff subbed on video i found some subs of random dokkiri camera episodes not too long ago
  on video  on youtube
    yoikos first smash web series episode is up in the op sakurai shows up about halfway through      their nintendo live 2018 stuff is also up in there if you havent seen it yet
these two are still the last uploads    im getting scared
  i have cave noire and detective conan as repros on gb and also battletoads on famicom  tldr crazy expensive games i couldnt play otherwise
  when you make his mii      hopefully this will get subbed
i just bought a super famicom controller and when i got it the right and down parts of the dpad are barely responsive is there a way to fix it
open it up and clean the contacts  rubber pads with rubbing alcohol
      buy a new controller
    and wash your fucking hands
  throw it in the fuckin tresh
was he a bro or an annoying faggot
he was a good man   also he looks like zenigata from lupin iii
  he was a cuck
  the whole game sucked
  at the end of the day he was a bro and also this 
i think hardass with a heart of gold is the trope that best describes him
  why not both you know like a biological brother
nobody finer than adelbert steiner
  the latter then later the former
  hes really fucking lame for a lot of the game but he has a kind of awakening when he realizes he doesnt have to live his live being ordered around or something
  its you can still be dutiful and loyal just to your friends instead of royal pieces of shit
    annoying faggot
only hated by children who grew up in a household without values most likely vegan
  first one then the other
    almost certain that that was what they were going for
he looks horrifying most characters in this game did really its not the chibi design tons of games have that something about the artstyle of 9 in particular is fucked up
he started of being an absolute tool basically the lead of the military cleanup squad zidane runs rings around him garnet manipulates the fuck out of his kind heart the people he serves dont even respect him and see him as an absolute joke   eventually he realises he shouldnt blindly follow his duty and starts to think and act for himself eventually he warms up to and buddies up with vivi and through their mutual friendship zidane and steiner start to respect and bond with each other a bit esepcially when they realise both of them just want whats best for the princess even if they dont quite agree on it  at least thats how i remembered it its been over 10 years since i played the game
  something about the artstyle of 9 in particular is fucked up    you want to elaborate on that 9s artstyle has always been charming as fuck to me in a medievalfantasy style way    the only thing thats ever bothered me was steiners exposed shins
  i thought he was cool since i first saw him a big nig in a suit of armor he pairs well with the niglet
  eventually he warms up to and buddies up with vivi  youre a retard he respects vivi from the very first moment he meets him
i know that he cheated some of his high scores but why do people care about him specifically out of any other world record holder for video games i heard that he made nintendo popular in the states is that true how hard is it to get a perfect game in either pacman or donkey kong    
because hes an insufferable cunt anyone who acts that arrogant has it coming for them
i never gave a fuck about that faggot it was obvious that hes an insufferable cunt that never grew up
  why do people care about him specifically out of any other world record holder for video games  because the average gamer is a dribbling brainlet who lives for drama
  hes put a lot of effort into promoting himself hes not important in any sense at all hes not responsible for anything amazing happening in the world of video games hes good at old games but not uniquely so he got the first perfect pacman game right after the official rules changed if he hadnt done it somebody else would have within a month
  the vr chad warden
  
  oh wow i never knew he streamed
because he has a rock stars ego without the millions of fans to justify it he is was relevant to only a few hundred people and maybe name recognition among a few thousand more
he is the first vidya eceleb
  he cheated some of his high scores    he used an emulator he never cheated he got the scores legit he just did it in mame
  kids made nintendo popular in the states not bill
    hivemind
  i heard that he made nintendo popular in the states is that true  fucking no
  he sued over this its part of why people single billy out he is a massive fucking prick
  he got the scores legit  how do you know that
   giving a fuck about pro gaming in any form or capacity
  why not its more relevant that most other competitive activities
  he got the scores legit  the obvious editing cuts beg to differ
  why do people care about him specifically out of any other world record holder for video games  twin galaxies let billy get away with a lot of shit that other people just didnt the king of kong doc gets a lot of shit for casting a bad light on billy but he was an arrogant asshole and all the shit that came out in the last year about him potentially cheating he used mame for a lot of his high score runs any idiot who thinks thats not a big problem is a liar or a moron with emulators you can pause save and load states    billy and twin galaxies were entwined in a business relationship he gave a lot of publicity for twin galaxies and in return he received preferential treatment seriously tg employees were known to gut your cabinets to make sure you had the correct board and everything worked to factory specification and disqualify for the tiniest infractions while billy never actually submitted scores in the presence of a tg judge he used his name recognition to shut newcomers down
  he says on a gaming board
  do you really believe gaming and watching people game is the same thing im actually asking honestly curious
  oh bill
he is an overt narcissist or in plain english an insufferable cunt that never grew up thanks 
gamer losers where desperate for a rock star hero to make them look like they didnt waste their lives that they glorified the first douche bag to get a high score
  this is a board about video games not specifically about playing them
  i know that he cheated some of his high scores but why do people care about him specifically out of any other world record holder  i also dont like lance armstrong and enron    people hate cheats and the higher the pedestal the greater the fall    hes an even bigger assole for the fact there were other gamers who deserved the fame and money    billy faked his scores and got endorsments and sponsorship including being able to promote his own business    i hope he gets sued into oblivion    theiving cunt
its a hot sauce industry hit job meant to destroy his hot sauce brand because they view it as a threat obviously its not working
  that shit is tasty nigga
  basically all of this twin galaxies quickly became a clubhouse that legitimized fame for a select group of gamers who were chasing records at the time this club includes people like mitchell and rogers somehow the whole affair always reminded me of all the socalled martial arts halls of fame out there that were started by other martial artists with absolutely no authority on the matter solely for the purposes of inducting themselves and their friends and anyone else willing to pa err meet the stringent requirements for inclusion into such an elite organization billy is kinda like the ashida kim of the video gaming world the difference being that billy apparently actually knows how to play video games so at least hes got that much going for him and hot sauce i guess      why has mitchell suddenly become the /shmupg/ mascot shouldnt it at least be one of the random twitch/farm trannies they obsess over
  nowhere near as timeless and hilarious as big papi
whats with the crossboard invasion
  no i mean the invasion from shmupg
  thats a pretty cool story anyway whats with the invasion
  but i thought you werent from shmupg
  antiskill  jarpig  obey picture  mason jarpig picture  do i even need to post the archive links cmon guys just stop
yeah retardo stop disrupting our safespace we dont enjoy your shitposts here just stay on /vg/ where you subhuman memelords belong even if you discuss games you arent welcome here
  stop the witch hunting anti skill jarpiggerino faggerino retardo madmaxine creamkrautina obey verboten shmupg buzzwords  we were here first its not fair it was her turn  yeah totally not a shmupg invasion    did you guys actually have anything to say about the thread topic got an opinion good or bad about our guy billy actual legend or washed up hot sauce cheater is there even any credibility in having records for games like pacman or dk are they challenging enough to matter
  actual retro game classics  i agree  yet absolutely nobody here plays them  but i play them and id imagine most other people on a board dedicated to retro games do or at least have as well  you guys  who
  notice how this op starts to link to shmupg as mods were fucking this community up this is when it was forced to move to /vg/ with less retarded moderation  at least this explains all the trolling and bitterness
  too bad you never see scoring threads here  probably because most of us dont play for score personally i dont im nowhere near good enough to do so in either game my consistency puts me just over 1m in pacman which is laughable compared to people capable of killscreening with nearperfect or actually perfect as mitchells done at least once runs lets not even discuss my dk scores i have the suspicion that not playing for score somehow translates into antiskill jarpig though doesnt it
  how was i supposed to know all i know is they show up here in any thread even tangentially related to arcade games and troll the place up i dont care about the history nor was i a part of it so why do i have to watch every thread i try to participate in go to shit over things that werent my fault
  wait you play pacman and dk but not for the score what  yes thats correct ive been playing them not for the score since they were new ive been around that long so i suspect that my not playing them for the score isnt going to change anytime soon if at all this is obviously a bit different than playing on a machine with your buddies over some beers chasing a high score for the goof i think everyone does that but playing for score the way someone like mitchell does it nah im good thanks
  you just mean you dont go for wrlevel scores or maybe even that you dont care about scoring pbs  uhh sure im assuming pbs is personal best right in any case i really do just play them to see how far i can get i dont particularly care about what score that results in although it would certainly be pretty cool to come close to a world record i dont really consider that a life goal though nor is it something id ever spend time pursuing
   threads about this kind of gaming on /vr/ ever  they might be a little more plentiful if they didnt immediately devolve into jarpig trolling and arguments over why people play what they do complete with insinuations that theres only one way to correctly play a game
  im sorry did you actually want me to come here and blog every time i get together to down some suds and play arcade games with my buddies
  what kind of mental gymnastics are these to try to distance yourself from liking score  theyre probably similar to the gymnastics required to distance yourself from the notion that people actually play and enjoy games for different reasons than you do    this is never whats implied when people say they play for score its mostly personal bests for the fun of selfimprovement in a skillbased game  this seems pretty selfevident but thanks all the same  you have a weird and distorted view of scoring players man drop the stereotypes  what
  calling it a jarpig or some shit  dont even need to leave the thread lol  
billy the hot sauce king mitchell will never be beaten
shmupg btfo yet again
  you say threads like that are made only to be bullied  citation needed
  and i linked you the post where the jarpig shit started
  but that bullshit is just you moving the goalposts no one said anything even remotely like the scenario youre asking people to link
  to which you said  i didnt say anthing i was just pointing out where the jarpig shit started all this talk about casual scorign bullies is just goalpost moving
  ok glad you admit no one bullies scoring players here  was this ever debated or did you mean non scoring anyway the only reason youre even worried about it is because the faggot you keep accusing me of being was right and i posted the evidence in this very thread if youre not playing for a high score or w/e youre a no skill jarpig and all conversation immediately gets shut down  wot u ply poast you are scoars jarpigs only scoring matter
  nope never happens  in these kinds of games thats almost synonimous to playing for score the longer you survive the higher the score what kind of mental gymnastics are these to try to distance yourself from liking score lmao  lol  they get caught they indeed are what you say no skill jarpig  lol why would you even care if they are ya people get mad when someone says some dumb shit that insinuates that becuase they arent good at a game they shouldnt be allowed to talk about it  when they arent they gladly talk about the game theyre playing  why cant they just gladly talk about the game theyre playing without any dumb insults or fake elitism or even if theyre good at it
  why are people like that infesting arcade threads they dont like nor play  there arent actually what makes you think there are  nah we just encourage them to play for the skill and enjoy getting better rather than stick to gay elf and collecting plastic  why if they want to collect plastic and play dragons sword fantasy or w/e let them if its retro its vr the fact that you even care what games people play is a little weird let alone how theyr eplaying them  in most of these cases they dont even play the game they just come here to seethe at the mere pressence of arcade / skillbased discussion  nah this is bullshit im not doing it and neither is anyone else in this thread this is your personal version of pol or w/e a boogeyman that doenst reall exist but youll keep coming into these threads to spam jarpig until they actually do tho
  thread about arcade games / thread about skillbased discussion js  please remove bad shmup anons  then stop comign into the thread with fuck all u no skill jarpig babbies skill onlee plz you cant not understand this lol  shmupg migrated for a reason as previously shown itt  seems like youre still here tho lel
  lol you cant be lacking this much self awareness you just cant be you hav eto understand that this no skill jarpig scoarez stuff is stuff that people report becuase they dont want it in the thread i dont think its because they dont want skill based discussion or w/e i think they just dont want to be insulted for not being interested in that talk of course this stuff gets pruned lol    you said in your last post that shmupg migrated if i read the thread right wasnt that because you wanted less strict moderation didnt you ever stop to think about why you had to give a fuck about moderation in the first place 4chan isnt a vacuum brah there are all sorts of differnet people here and it seems like most of them were reporting yoru posts
this thread is more cringe inducing than bill and his saucestained tie
  they dont want this kind of community on /vr/  ya lol thats kinda what i was trying to get you to realize in my last post im glad you actually get it tho i was worried  again why the fuck do you think this general migrated  so whats the big deal then people who want skill based discussion can go to shmupg and you guys can come here to talk about w/e if it doesnt fit in with shmupg
  but i guess this isnt an issue at all for you  honestly youre right its not an issue for me at all  if anythinf you prefer that safe space  yah pretty much its nice to just be able to talk about w/e without all the spam and insults and shit its like just talk about games we dont need all the no skill jarpig crap people play all kinds of old games and they like them in different ways thats cool just let it be cool lol
i heard batsugun special and the punisher are pretty good for 1cc virgins any other suggestions
  same suggestions that get posted in every one of these threads
  and this is why you get called an antiskill jarpig  they dont want this kind of community on /vr/  were on like seven layers of irony here ill try to stop enjoying games tho sorry
  why do you feel insulted or attacked right after i insult and attack you  lol i dunno man
  insults only affect you if they are true and you feel bad about being what the insult is  nah thats not true this is just what you tell yourself so that you can stereotype people and not ever have to consider their point of view
  no the act of trying to insult someone is the insulting part the words you use to deliver that insult are of little consequence
  your favorite game genre is jrpgs  lol no it isnt  you dont care about skillbased gameplay  yah youre probably right sometimes i like to talk about strategy for certain arcade games i like but for the most part i could take or leave skill based talk so yeah  would rather not have that kind of community on /vr/  lol i dont care if a community like that is on vr why would i or anyone else i just care about being left alone if i dont meet some arbitrary criteria for gaming determined by other random people not a really hard concept to understand  stereotypes are one thing but being right is another  but youre not right and i think this is what youre having trouble coping with im not an antiskill jarpig i dont really have an opinion about skillbased discussion and i dont play jrpgs this doesnt mean i dont resent whats obviously supposed to be an insult
  true but youre only offended by the word if its something you feel ashamed of  nah this is still bullshit again this is you trying to stereotype without ever having to consider another pov or admit you might be wrong  wot u ply  i like video games huge fan
  not really my responsibility to prove stereotypes wrong and ive been in just enough of these threads to realize how wot u ply works if i answer then the current discussion that you really want out of gets dropped in favor of trying to out me as some sort of fraud if i dont answer its absolute proof of the antiskill jarpig stereotype being true
  i guess youre too ashamed to admit what kind of games you like because thatd prove the stereotype  the funny part is youre trying to play the wot u ply card in a thread that isnt eve ntechnically about arcade games lol
  le shame baity bait le  kek  but think that shame is there for a reason  theres no shame its just that wot u ply is old and weve all seen it before no one here is stupid enough to take the bait after its been done so much although i admit that im bizarrely curious about why you seem obsessed over what games people play
  that shame is there for a reason  the reason is my hobby is shared by neckbeard autists who shitpost threads i can understand why someone might feel shame
  unironically this
  quite easy and fun clears  why do you think this is what anyone cares about in a video game lol
  this i will never understand why these nerds dont want us here i dont get why these stupid little jarpigs cant understand that video games are meant to be played in a certain way with specific goals why even bother playing video games unless your entire identity and ego is wrapped up in holding world records in them its not like theyre the last thing we have left after failing at everything else in life that would be ridiculous and why do they get so mad when we insult them    dont even get me started on these people who dont even play arcades fucking horror elements man
  based like billy
  madmaxine absolutely seething
bahmpu
  t krautina
people like tearing down heroes
  calm the fuck down tardo
  dude doctored video footage lied about playing on real hardware and got caught thats not a skill thing dude is a gaming legend and hes really fucking good but you cant expect people to just be cool with it despite him putting up some monster scores after the fact hopefully hell keep it up and move past this drama        seething
  well in general professionally skilled people are liked because they are so good at what they do it leaves you wondering how they did it when the answer can be something where they dont have to admit that they are just inferior then they love to cling to that answer this can be seen in professional sports as well    at the end of the day billy is still better than anyone on /vr/ at pac man or donkey kong
  billy is still better than anyone on /vr/ at pac man or donkey kong  shmupg too
  not all people despise their superiors in skill some respect them or even have them as their reference to improve themselves  at least youre honest about why you play or why you care about how other play
bill the shill master bitchel the dame of mame the doctor of doctoring
  funnily enough im not a scoring or competitive player
  he doesnt
  i guess this is the kind of insecurity you guys feel when were around that pushes you to remove us but think that shame is there for a reason  help me understand this you genuinely think someone feels ashamed because theyre not specifically into scoring or 1ccs and you are do i have this right
he didnt cheat  the autists took him down on some technicality over the hardware he used nonetheless there guy can get those scores he claimed and has done it in person multiple times to multiple witnesses      it was a literal al capone move cant get the guy for his murders so they go after his taxes so cunty
  mostly because it really does seem like bait as someone in the reply chain mentioned at least once if they arent into scoring or 1ccing why would it even matter what they play unless you were looking to derail a thread with jrpg nonsense kinda like what looks like already happened here
  chads like billy mitchell get a lot of hate from losers that will never be half as good
  what in the literal fuck are you talking about im not reading anymore of the wall of garbage than i already have so ill just assume im missing something im asking why you think theres some aura of shame that goes along with not scoring or 1ccing arcade games now im also asking why you think that liking jrpgs and arcade games are mutually exclusive hobbies
  the shame is the one jarpigs have for being too shit at games despite having spent tons of money and time into the hobby to the point that they feel insecure about saying what kinds of games they like around people who are more skilled and play harder games  see this is just fucking wacky to me this really sounds like you somehow think youre better than someone else due to what games youre playing or how good you are at playing them i mean were still talking about video games right these things that range from idle amusement to childrens toys depending on any rational point of view we havent drifted into brain surgery or astrophysics without me noticing right  no theyre not mutually exclusive but theres a big correlation  a big correlation between what and what exactly
  honestly we might as well be talking about different hobbies despite these all being technically video games  an astute observation on your part it really does seem that way that being said why do you come here to try and force a conversation that it seems no one here really wants to have moreover why do you seem to become hostile and combative when people tell you they dont want to have the aforementioned conversation additionally why do you feel the need to insult them for that again please help me understand where youre coming from  rpg fans dont usually care for arcade games and viceversa arcade players dont usually care for rpgs  this goes right back to the things i just asked why try to have this conversation with people who quite obviously and by your own admission dont want to have it
  this thread would apparently suggest otherwise rather than participating in a conversation about scoring or 1ccing arcade machines they much like myself really just seem to be trying to understand where youre coming from some a little more hostile than others but thats to be expected i suppose people tend to not react well to insults
  go to sleep billy tao rupi etc
  antiskill jarpig is only an insult if youre ashamed of your tastes  absurd its not even an insult at all im more impressed that you think it is in the first place if someone were for whatever reason ashamed of their tastes in video games of all things why would you bother caring some of you seem to have an obsession with the concept of antiskill thats bordering on pathological it really just looks like they dont want to talk about arcade machines with you
  i was referring to the constant mention of antiskill mostly and just because i dont find something to be an insult doesnt make it any less of one to someone else also i really cant help but feel like youre sort of avoiding my questions from earlier is there any truth to that or is it just in my head
  you could just like games that arent about the skill and be proud of it  funny i do like games that arent about skill and im quite proud of the fact not so much jrpgs though i grew up with crpgs so thats where the heart is at you know stuff like the bards tale games and wizardry i dont think anyone would argue that they take much skill of course i also enjoy a game of donkey kong jr and jackal from time to time take that as you will    so about what i asked you earlier in this post right here  have you given those questions any thought
  i cant help but notice that you ignored the fact that i said i played other games why might that be also have you given any serious thought to those questions i asked
  well your favorite genre is rpgs and you very rarely touch arcades  see now im really starting to think this is a mental issue i havent said or even implied either one of these things  lmao then you dare say i stereotype you  huh  yeah i already answered  no you really havent the conversation youre referring to isnt the one im asking you questions about i think youre smart enough to know that whatever the case i really am just trying to understand where this irrational hatred is coming from
  those are both quite the stretch but well roll with it well let me assure you that rpgs arent my favorite genre and i play arcade machines a bit more frequently than occasionally so with that said have you given any thought as to why youre trying to force people into a conversation that they by your own admission arent trying to have or why you become combative when they tell you as much
  i couldve sworn you said just a little while ago that they didnt why the change of heart
  well that seems like a valid question as in it looks like hes actually asking hey whats with /shmupg/ suddenly busting through the proverbial door and throwing antiskill jarpig and seething around completely unprovoked while were trying to have a billy mitchell thread    that said why did you guys do that anyway
  invasion  well whatever call it what you want it doesnt answer the question though why the unprovoked attack
  i cant really understate my personal belief that this is a pathological obsession while i dont personally hate billy i really cant see how a dislike of him especially in light of recent events somehow constitutes antiskill or whatnot    actually put that last thought on hold temporarily im still not entirely sure what this term really means is this meant to suggest that theres a subset of gamers who are specifically against skill in video games or is it more of a they just dont care for arcade games thing
  if you keep up with recent gaming journalism this shouldnt surprise you  and i dont as i find them just as looney as the sorts of people who genuinely believe in an antiskill sentiment among gamers
  hey thats great and all thanks for your time i think ive come to understand what i wanted to
  there are many paid journalists to push this agenda  there arent many paid games journalists period good fanfic though
  thank you im going to try hopefully a thread pops up one of these days that lets me see you guys as something other than social justice warrior with a slightly different colored hair dye like this thread has
billy is a psycopath who build his entire self esteem on those fake records and lies  todd rogers is also a cheater but hes a funny and chubby fraud cant dislike him
  i know this dude hes always playing that game at the local vidya game bar now i know why he has cameras on him while he plays with his kong
  this the notorious east side dave interview went so over the top in trying to make him look good but hes a fucking bore to listen to    glad dave was able to get some attention out of it but it was definitely one of the worst episodes of the east side dave show
  while its true that most of us know fully well how good billy is at certain games he did not get these scores legit and theres been no proof to show for it except poorly edited videos from an emulator
  there are many paid journalists to push this agenda  paid journalists  paid  the funny part is that this person thinks they know anything at all about the industry
  because hes an insufferable cunt anyone who acts that arrogant has it coming for them  couldnt agree more i had suspected for a long time that it was all an act of sorts but it was later confirmed to me that billy is like this all the time pretty sad
      nice damage control journos
gaming journalists are worse than people that rape children bottom feeding trash of society
  dipshit please i wish i could get paid to sit around and write a whole bunch of fictional inflammatory crap meant to piss off tribalistic gamer kiddos fat dangerhairs and paranoid nutjobs i have to settle for shitposting on this trashcan of a website for free
  hey thats pretty good
  so basically what youre saying is youre helping push their shit agenda and for free wow
  no what im saying is that i wish i could help them push their agenda pissing retards off sounds like a pretty good hobby and the possibility of getting paid to do it professionally sounds almost dreamlike
  that sounds reasonable thanks for being more civilized than me i thought you were being a piece of shit
  i am being a piece of shit my point was that id like to be a professional piece of shit id gladly be a gaming journo if it came with a paycheck and the promise of being able to troll massive swaths of the gaming community at my leisure thats not going to work at that point thats going to fun and still getting paid
  no i mean i get that maybe i just have a very low bar for these things but i still find your honesty slightly more redeeming than the usual games need change schlock you get around sites like kotaku polygon etc not that id notice the difference if you were being paid to do it anyway thanks again for being civilized have a good whatever your timezone makes it
  but i still find your honesty slightly more redeeming than the usual games need change schlock you get around sites like kotaku polygon etc  dont because id pushing exactly that schlock if i were getting paid to do it the only difference is that id be enjoying the reaction it got and not just the paycheck
  do you like alien soldier
  am i getting paid to like it am i getting paid to tell you to like it
  anon the point was driven enough you could have driven your point through concrete at this point im curious about whether you have an opinion on this game or not
  i dont even know what fucking game that is why did you just bring it up out of nowhere this is a silly bitchell thread thats long since degraded into faggot kiddos shitposting in the first place
  yes thanks
  are you a fucking bot or something
    that is one scary looking dude why does aquas want to smash that again
  now wait in what year did this happen what newspaper is this
  and then theres this chad looking motherfucker
  as opposed to what banking your entire personal identity on being good at a video game to detract from how shite your life is yall shmupg motherfuckers roast yourselves    dat filename  copy monkeys running amok

  what game
  eyes wide shut for playstation
  boku no pico for pc
  not retro but sims 2 on ps2 is great co op splitscreen fun best game for couples and friends for giggles
  couples  friends  anon
  faggotry aside i agree the sims 2 was way better on ps2/gc than pc outclassed only by the urbz sims in the city for the same platforms imho
  didnt urbz have bugs all over the place with item placement
  never had any problem with that sort of thing ironically i had way more bugs with the sims 2
  theyre coming soon maybe you should think twice about opening the door
  if we are just talking about base game then sure but pc version had tons of expansion packs to iultimately make it the superior version plus i remember the ps2 version having really long load times
  the hills have eyes on n64
    yea i had gc version of the sims the multiplayer was pretty fun
  urbz  this is a ds game anon  i refuse to acknowledge the other versions

why live
you are a fucking retard
all of their stuff is on redacted
  good another piracy site is gone remember to report all romsites that you see stealing is wrong
if you dont already have every single game made before 2000 in an hdd or three i dont know what to tell you  modern games are shit so who cares
  lel nu4channel users amirite    i just downloaded your mom biggest download ever to come out my internet port
  they clearly state that they want to get on with their lives so they seem to be leaving their cringy faggotry behind and doing just that good enough reason for them to want to continue to live
  what is this site
  dead  inb4 404site and thread
  it had every gog game even those no longer available on gog and kept them all up to date    i used it to get dnd games you couldnt get without buying the beamdog cancer versions like baldurs gate etc
i used them to download gc isos fuck    i really dont want to send pictures of my feet to private tracker admins where else can i download shit in a convenient way
first theiso/retrozone and now goodolddownloads any other good ddl sites for old pc games especially those that dont have modern releases
    this site has many games if you dont mind having to solve a million google recaptchas
  if you dont think thats anything but an inconvenience what the fuck
  expecting money for work someone else did for your company 20 years ago in perpetuity is wrong paying for remakes and rereleases amounts to corporate welfare for the licenseholders
  lel this dumb comment made me laugh
  send me feet pics
  fucking kill yourself
  pirating from gogcom    lmbo thats on the same level as shoplifting at goodwill grow some goddamn dignity
  this
  what a shame
wow you guys are really poor arent you
why do zoomers shit on golden age arcade games and classic early 8bit console games but praise cheap soulless trash like spyro the dragon
because arcade games are trash and spyro is enjoyable
  not an argument
  im not even arguing arcades were scams to rip off quarters from retarded children and this is a simple fact
  soul golden age arcade games   soulless spyro
  imagine the level of retardation youd need to have to reach the conclusion that spyro the dragon is more enjoyable than say galaga or robotron 2084
  post evidence of this or im assuming youre strawmanning
  it is fuck golden age cancer
he thinks zoomers can actually formulate their own opinions    also back to /shmup/ its like no one over there plays videogames at all
  not an argument
  because they grew up with spyro and will never ever get to experience gold age arcade
  what a great loss sarcasm
because they grew up with them who cares what people much younger than you like i dont give a shit if some 20something doesnt get my hobbies and neither should you
the fuck is this thread
  imagine the level of retardation youd need to have to reach the conclusion that spyro the dragon is comparable to games of totally different genres like say galaga or robotron 2084
  im more nostalgic for spyro because i actually played it
  this game is the reason alpha males are a dying breed in the zoomer generation ive never met a zoomer who praises this game that isnt either transgender or a faggot
ever liking banjo spyro croc etc anthropomorphic mascot guys collectathon/shallow 3d platformers    theyre shit and im glad they died
  fucking excuse you  i fucking love arcade games and spyro  i still dont know what the fuck a zoomer is though back in my day we called our folk millenials
imagine making the 90th spyro hate thread we get it some of us were young enough to appreciate spyro when he debuted liking spyro and liking 8bit console games arent mutually exclusive
  yeah i see this a lot round here people praising utterly forgettable fifth gen landfill like spyro and crash while shitting on the 8bit era classics for being too primitive
  i have never shat on 8bit games for being primitive even once  christ i even praise some atari 2600 games where most people wouldnt
  90th  the number of cocks the average spyro fan has fellated
you were probably being breastfed when spyro first came out nobody but other zoomers are buying this disingenuous act
  the gaming industry is cucked by women now its not about age
  stop projecting spyro trans faggot
  guyro the fagon
  stop projecting he says as he calls me the thing he secretly is for enjoying the wrong video game
this reminds me of that one guy shitposting about mgs and half life and getting touchy over thief
  your favorite video game stars an underaged purple dragon with a sassy attitude just stop and think for a second how that reflects on your masculinity or lack thereof
  what spyro is headstrong and fearless you not being able to see past that because hes purple only reflects on how fragile your nonmasculinity is
i feel bad defending spyro now though because reignited is ass and people really need to stop pretending its good
  no i genuinely hold that opinion im sorry you dont like it but i always prefered 2d platformers to these dull collectathons dk64 is another culprit boring tedious pile of ooze     its okay if you like them i dont have to
  spyro is way better than dk64 and those other games you listed because spyro feels awesome to control being able to gallop / run and glide was fun as fuck collecting those pretty gems was satisfying breathing fire on people is strangely way more enjoyable than combat moves in the vast slew of platformers i played in that time period
  you forgot to mention the part where you dont have to constantly backtrack to barrels and swap out your kongs
  swap out your kongs  this phrase really cracks me up
  because theyre plebs with no taste    crash bandicoot was actually pretty decent
i tried spyro 1 ps1 last month it was clunky but rather okay overall until the final boss i spent 5 hours straight trying to catch the bastard before giving up i came to be able to nail those key holding assholes with speed and ease devs had some big balls to not checkpoint you after the boss fight proper had begun respect for that but going through the key grind after each and every death did nothing to help me actually succeed and win the game overall pretty chill and easygoing game would recommend and this is from someone who hasnt played/enjoyed many 3d platformer collectathons fwiw
  shut the fuck up
spyro has aged well though crash is purely nostalgia but spyro holds up
  just finished crash 1 for the first time 2 days ago not zoomer but dad was anti consoles and only had a pc honestly pretty good game solid controls the only bullshit i found was some of the jumps in the breaking bridge and the shitty saving system otherwise decent game
  controls and save system in the sequels are far better
    thats literally the opposite though spyro and crash always went hand in hand because the two companies were buddies but spyro was never good
  because furry pedo trans faggots are rife in the zoomer community
lmao getting this emotional over video games
  imagine the retardation of levels youd have to need to conclusion the reach that mario super world is better than 64 superman since difference is totally genres
    spyro is definitely better than dk64 ill give you that
  you dont make any sense brainlet and we dont care about your glorified slot machines  there is a reason emulators for arcades exists and nobody talks about those shallow moneygrabber excuses for a game  you can call me a zoomer all you want you are a minority and you are going extinct very soon im enjoying your tears and lmao thinking at your allowances being drained by shitty games while i was pirating superior console and pc games and emulating portables since the late 90s
  being this mad about spyro   relax you might not like the arcade model of gobbling quarters but that doesnt mean the games are bad galaga is a good game     im not the other guy btw i just felt you needed some perspective over here talking about extinction and shit because of a damn arcade cabinet
  its ok just a little tired of contrarians in this board allegedly one of the best but in reality full of scalpers and idiots spending thousands in ancient toys in the name of authenticity or worse they buy 300 evermeme and get salty if called out on their retardation  im out enjoy being fucked by nostalgia
  thats fine but using harsh language implies you look down on people who do
  zoomers   arcade    because when these little faggots grew up the lame ripoff arcades had already been replaced with the glorious gaystations
youre the cheap soulless piece of garbage why bother shitting such a colorful pastely cute wonderful game you just glide around and torch dudes and ram em its so relaxing   im sure you have something better to do
  zoomers are retarded
  zoomers have a hardon for sandbox/openworld bullshit for some reason perhaps its autism
  galagas the sort of thing you play for 10 minutes and then never again because youve already seen it all
    spyro is definitely better than dk64 ill give you that    spyro is a game you can tell it was made with little children in mind dk64 required lateral thinking and figuring out where all the collectables were
  zoomers  soulless  i wish everyone who used these terms would die same with kino
  open world games and exploring in general are actually pretty good
boomers shitting on spryo  retards shitting on arcade games  faggots the lot of ya
  he started first i actually like arcades when i infinite credits
  use the red kong to press the red switch  truly the highest lateral thinking of our times
  imagine the level of retardation youd need to reach the conclusion that what is enjoyable is not subjective and that people simply have different taste than you
  jewish brainwashing they are slaves rats in a box earning rng cheese from their overlords
  this  if you didnt have and enjoy both namco museum and spyro on your ps1 dont fucking talk to me
  soulless is okay but zoomer and kino fucking boil my blood
spyro a fun and easy game  its not as hard as crash or 8bit games why do people like it reeeeeee when will this difficultgood meme end i guess i should know by now everyone on this site is fuckin autistic and hates fun but jesus christ you people really love to hammer that fact home    i love spyro i love crash i love 8bit i love 16bit fight me you assblasted faggots real retro fans enjoy video games
  buzzwords  fuck off back where you came from
  its what those kids like to say nowadays not a lot you can do about it unfortunately
not sure if this belongs in /vr/ or /v/ but is this thing worth getting in 2018 i just want to play emulators on it
no get a n3ds or n2ds
  this probably psp is pretty dogshit for snes its decent for other early stuff though as well as psx and there are a few good native games as well
  can it at least play the dkc trilogy well
  no it can play them and you can complete them but they perform and sound like shit
emulators no arcade comps and psx games natively yes
  i just want to play emulators on it  what do you want to emulate
  i still play mine pretty often of course theres better stuff out there now but im not shelling out 300 for a gdp ytmnd just because starfox runs like shit on my psp i bought for 20 i can live without it ps1 games run great everything up to 16 bit era besides snes runs excellent and im happy with the snes games that do run fine im gonna buy 14 more psps just to spite everyone shilling gpd or whatever overpriced bullshit is better for retro games
   psp is pretty dogshit for snes  as someone who has tested about 200 games for it the good to bad game ratio it around 60/40 older and launch nintendo titles run almost perfect but you get into trouble with the newer and more graphically impressive releases you can squeeze out some extra performance if you fiddle with the frameskip on some games
  what about the vita the prospect of a portable emu system with a oled screen sounds appealing but not if the hardware cant even handle alot of snes games
if you are a cheap bastard you can squeeze years of playtime out of it  hell even most snes rpgs i threw at it ran fine finished dq3 on it not so long ago shame for some stuff like ogre battle tho
  i never tried but would guess no      the good to bad game ratio it around 60/40    yeah i consider that pretty much dogshit
  what about the vita  not the same poster but i can tell you that there arent as many emulators for vita neither as polished than there are for the psp however since you can run custom psp firmware on the vita you can run the emulators designed to run on the psp on the vita
  the vitas emulators are no better than the psps in fact for some consoles gba mostly your best bet is to run psp emulators in psp mode
    is there an input lag discrepancy between the two though
i enjoy and get great use out of mine but you need to find very specific forks of emulators to do so
vita has much stronger hardware  but if you just wanna play snes games do it on a 3ds
  what forks
  does it run them better at all i was never happy with psp emulation of most gba games
  no maybe if it was 3040 for a psp go for such a small amount more you can get android based shit that actually has working emulators ignoring some retards that couldnt get their android device working with emulators android is second to only windows for emulators
  gpsp in pspemu runs faster than gpsp in retroarch    mariokart runs at 60fps in gpsp psp compared to 57fps with stuttering in gpsp retroarch or 55fps stable in vba retroarch i dont have an original psp to compare with
  ive been looking at the psp the vita and just getting one of those expandable/telescopic controllers to basically turn my phone into a handheld for a couple months now i decided on just getting the controller just this week it hasnt arrived yet but im excited for it     from my looking around note that i dont live in the us so i have some other considerations    the psp is decent but its surprisingly lacking in some departments if you can get it for dirt cheap then sure i guess i decided against walking around with another device charger etc and was a little worried at the screen and a bunch of other stuff im also skeptical of relying on an old handheld    what got me into this was this sudden new hype around the vita it started to look really fucking good but apparently theres performance issues that the vita has with native games looking past that when i decided to go ahead and started adding up the costs they started to really add up pretty quickly and it started to seem too expensive for what i wanted it to do i thought the proprietary storage killing it was a meme but it looks to be very much true i may still get one if the price goes down at least for the atelier games if you can afford it and dont care about the performance issues that the hype train seemingly ignores then it looks like the best option    im fucking broke though so i just decided on this bounabay telescopic controller i found on amazon maybe itll be shit but its cheap the battery life is supposed to be really good and i always have my phone on me which is also powerful enough to do what i want it to do again i dont know what the controller is like yet but i can post here with an overview once i get it if youd like
  different video game systems
  a lot of those controllers are garbage hope you didnt go for the cheapest one i have a pretty good one but i still use my vita because its smaller than the controller anyway only downside is my phone is much stronger than the vita so i cant play n64 games and other newer consoles on the vita
  dogshit is this snes is virtually unplayable on psp meme its far from perfect but its not the trashfire people make it out to be
i got a vita and ive been playing a ton of gba games via the psp mode its great at it also has an impressive library of native games on top of emulating most /vr/ games
  im running gba games with the psp mode on my vita and they are just about perfect
  theres an adaptor for the vita that goes in the cartridge slot that you can micro sds into itll run you like 10 bucks if your vita is hacked like it should be then storage is dirt cheap
    yep been getting into the psp library lately with ppsspp and it has a ton of great games been running them at 2x resolution on my phone and some of them look great on the small screen too kingdom hearts bbs could pass for a ps2 game same for dissidia duodecim and a few others ive tried so far some surprising hidden gems too like the red star super fun and challenging beat em up/shoot em up hybrid but no one knows about it great library all around
its main purpose is a portable psx emulator anything else is a bonus
how is the sega saturn emulation on this   i want to emulate saturn sega cd 32x gg ms and genesis
  different video game systems  what systems psp emualtes efficiently only a few being the most modern the first playstation
    thats funny bro  i have hi10 tablet for that    also does ps2 and with better battery life because lol intel 14nm
can you run retro arch on a psp
  everything the psp the vita can do better if you dont care about ps1 games pick up a new2/3ds
  i havent played in years but if its still bad at snes i know the gba and genesis emulators on it were good so the gba version of donkey kong country would work if you were okay with that
  id link you but the amount of searching i put in originally isnt conducive to finding them from source again if youre still interested ill copy them out and file share later today
  it cost me around 40 i really like the look of the telescopic controllers so its a real shame that the best you can get is one thats only not too terrible from some chinese manufacturer       didnt know about that thanks maybe ill grab one in a couple of months      you can but as far as i know not all of the cores youd expect are ported over
  that would be great anon
  ok so gba and snes forks gbas is specifically tuned for the 2000/3000 line and i believe needs a bios copy pasted into the first folder havent had any problems or slowdowns with it that cant be attributed to bad roms the snes emu runs pretty well and is all ready to go as is everything ive tried is playable maybe not perfect but im not picky    
  and in terms of alternates if you run a 1000 theres another gba fork specific to that these are the main ones ive searched and got use of though ive also emus for gb/c ws and genesis they arent anything special that cant be found on wololo or wherever
  no get a n3ds or n2ds    i want to know about emu on these how good are these emus for it    snes   psx   turbografx   gba 
  snes works fine for almost every game you can use the official virtual console or snes9x look here   gba is native you can create an installable package from a gba rom using a tool feels good playing my years old yugioh wc2006 savedata on a nintendo console  ive heard ps1 is unplayable unless for rpg dont know for turbografx  nes too is good
  only if youre a poorfag get a vita its an upgrade in every single way now
  nice  thanks anon
  not op but i have the vita 2000 as well its really good though i really want to buy the 1000 models with the oled display because it feels like im missing out my friend has it and the joke about the piss filter is completely true when looking at them side by side    anyway vita is great it would be my all time favorite if there was any way to output video signal not for recording since it is literally unplayable like that
  thanks anon ill do some more research for the tg16 it seems to have the most random issues with emulators that arent 100 complete
  you can remove most of the piss filter by enabling full rgb range in the registry editor its literally just the same problem as the ps3 even then i still prefer the slim since most oled models are over the hill now and at the point where theyre more inaccurate than the lcd
  gba emulation sucks  snes emulation sucks  2x integer scale results in a postage stamp image   nah
  use retroarch instead of psp emulator ports  use retroarch instead of psp emulator ports  vita screen resolution is exactly double the psp just scale as you would on a psp and double it you fucking moron  was it really that hard
  vba next runs worse than psp gba emulators  still sucks  doesnt even understand im talking about integer scaling in ra  i have a n3ds vita slim oled vita and psp no one should get a vita over a n3ds the snes vc and native gba bc blows the vitas offerings out of the water
  id rather not play any snes or gba games on my vita than use the eyecancer n3ds screen
  enjoy your squinting and slowdown lmao
  no problem im glad to help
  and im saying if your integer scaling makes your games look like a postage stamp youre scaling them wrong it shouldnt be any different than a psp since its just double resolution  although your argument is moot if youre shilling a n3ds a console which actually has a postage stamp sized screen
  even with integer scale limiting the games vertical size to 480 or 512 pixels its still bigger than a n3ds screen
    its not bigger than the xl im from burgerland and thats the only model we got at least until they released a few le regular size n3ds models so i typically dont include the xl part  it shouldnt be any different than a psp  and thats the problem
      hed rather take a garbage quality 240p display over a god tier qhd one with integer scaling
  still bigger than an actual gba the psp did suffer from not having enough vertical resolution to do a 2x integer scale but the vita can do 3x without any issues
  garbage quality  the ips panels found on some n3ds xl are higher quality than the ones found on the vita slim  god tier  not with that piss filter  muh oled  wont last more than a few years at this point      it can do a 3x scale when it comes to gba games but the software isnt good enough for that to matter imo anyway  the vita is the most cucked handheld of all time shitty library and its competition became the true successor to the psp
    the vitas somewhat better for snes games if you can find one 365 it can run almost all nonsuper fx games with retroarch and the snes9x 2005 core much nice dpad too supposedly the new 3ds runs games even faster single core cpu performance is the key with emulators but i dont have one to test
  the vita in theory can be much better at emulation than the n3ds its just that no one wants to optimize emulators for the thing by the time it got blown wide open nobody cared anymore its kind of a bummer if ra performed better and had some prescale filters available id probably use it over my xl    but it dont so i wont  the vita sux
    how many goalposts are you going to move now i know why they call you people nintendrones
  dont sweat it my dude you know how people act on this website
  by the time it got blown wide open nobody cared anymore  but people did care literally everything is getting regular updates again as a result of hencore even fucking mgba got an update recently despite everyone else moving onto retroarch cores
  i dont care for nintendo or most of their ips  goalposts  im not moving any because none of you vita niggers have yet to score      ra is getting updates on nearly every platform its on how many of those are vitaspecific and not just bug/crash fixes and changes to the ui
  im not talking about ra only though
  what else is there barring mgba of course
psps are fantastic  ive been playing mine since launch   dirt cheap nowadays and supports alot of console emulation snes emulation was never an issue for me but i dont really play that much of it ps1 emulation is perfect for 95 of games and roms are available in eboot format for your convenience out of all the ps1 games ive played ive found only 2 that didnt work monkey hero and devils dice    the actual psp library itself is damn good too the lack of l2 and r2 buttons can be a little bit annoying for some ps1 games but you get used to the alternatives recently 100d both oddworld games which both use combinations of all the buttons so its not a big deal    my only complaint is a lack of platformers for the psps catalogue   other than that really amazing device im well aware there are other devices on the market nowadays that are far more powerful but a psp will set you back about 20 a 32gb microsd cardadapter is about 8 damn cheap
if you can get a psp you can get a vita  get a vita or a n3ds
      retroarch can take care of your worries
pros and cons of a vita and a n3ds    pros of both  pretty much both emulate everything you could ever want vita gets the most out of retroarch and gba running in psp mode while 3ds has the virtual console and a couple of specific emulators    both are portable and easy to get secondhand      pros and of 3ds   snes is near perfect even on an old 3ds you can play most games at 60fps with snes9x on a new everything runs fine   nds games are wonderful   dont bother with ps its not playable possible but unplaybable   on new the top screen is a little wobbly this is by design so the hinges dont break as easily as the nds so forget about playing 3ds on a bumpy bus or car if you value your stuff or get a hard case to keep the screen in place      vita  with retroarch and psp mode you can play almost everything retro at full speed  sone snes games may get some hiccups but only graphicintensive games requiring special chips like fx or sa1 so very specific cases  can run ps flawlessly because it was built for it besides l2 and r2   nds barely runs   while snes is super playable and not as bad as people make it out to be on 3ds is still better but just snes    so basically do you want better portable snes or better portable ps
  open the homebrew browser and see for yourself
the best solution is still to have both a n3ds and a vita
  so basically do you want better portable snes or better portable ps  but at least vita can emulate a good part of snes library quite well while n3ds is dog shit with psx
  n3ds has perfect gba because it plays the games natively far better snes genesis mame and nes emulation in addition to nds games the only thing its missing is psx games but it does everything else far better
  gba/nds  not retro if were bringing in the big guns then vita also has psp and remote playback for ps3 ps4 and pc and it plays most gba games without issue anyway literally the only game ive had issues with are those gba video carts and even then its only pokémon and dragonball gt that have issues
  psp  steaming  big guns  nah fag
  no get a switch or vita
  theres a ton of compatibility issues with many major games on psp the n3ds also has streaming support so thats really a moot point not that youd want to stream on either console anyways it really comes down to do you want nds 3ds and perfect gba or ok gba support and excellent psx but its silly to say that the vita excels in anything else the battery life is worse and it has worse genesis snes and nes emulation and n3ds can emulate many arcade titles and even most cps3 games which is a far cry from what the vita can do
  tons of compatibility issues  such as if somethings not booting switch to sonys offficial driver and set the clockspeed to default   worse genesis emulation  it can run genesis plus gx full speed with every title you throw at it unlike the n3ds the battery life is leagues better too i dont know what youre on about   nes  it can run the same nes cores the 3ds can but with better performance unless you actually think the nes vc is better than nestopia ue   and n3ds can emulate many arcade titles and even most cps3 games  so can the vita whats your point
  hard to miss something youve never had i suppose    first ive ever heard of psp compatibility issues on the vita and definitely the first time anyone has ever claimed the 3ds has a better battery life and why wouldnt you want to stream ps3 can be choppy but both ps4 and nvidia gamesteam work perfectly the rest of your post is equal nonsense as pointed out by 
breath of fire thread i fucking miss katt
  also reposting          what would you like to be attempted to be implemented    /v/ is so fucking fast
no one gives a shit furfag
bump
  anyone else love her because of her green eyes
wtf im furry now
  love her for everything
do we really need daily threads the game is shallow as a sheet of paper
    ah bleus baby sister
is this the greatest dialogue choice in video game history
stop dont open that door
what was the site that listed all the funny video game dialogue it stopped being updated some time ago i think
no option for ill be back  wtf
  what was his problem
  
  its the most derivative
its been over 20 years but i still remember how this bit fucking slayed me  took me a second to see it but when it did it hit hard
was monkey island really big enough back then to warrant dialogue choices
  i have no idea what the fuck youre asking
i also loved the one in 3 with voodoo mama where she asks you if you want to see pictures of the kids that come over to play occasionally and the choices are something like hell no no freaking way by the love of god and all thats holy noooooo all of them resulting in guybrush saying uh maybeee later
  the curse of monkey island was great but i still find it weird how guybrush looks so badass in 2 with a beard and coat and everything and then in 3 hes just back to full beanpole
  what was this supposed to be
  no
  um explain anon to me pls im dum
  i dont get it the man clearly has two pipes
    its a pipe dream
      in game when the fisher talks to you he holds his pipe and has a talking head sprite with no pipe im his rested position he has a pipe in mouth and both hands on the rod he glitches at one point and has both his idle head sprite with the pipe in his mouth and his holding pipe hand sprite at the same time thus two pipes  its a programming meta joke
      yeah basically as he talks and gestures hell take his pipe out of his mouth and hold it at one point in the conversation he gestures in a way that normally would result in him not having the pipe in his mouth anymoreyet he still does as well as holding it  guybrush points it out its got nothing to do with the conversation
  i will never forget the keelhaul joke in mi1
  reminds me of that scene in mother 3 where the mr saturn makes a dramatic exit and when you get control again you see that he barely even walked offscreen
  i dont know but pic related is the greatest piece of dialogue in video game history
  its also a dialogue choice so you literally could have offered it as an answer for this thread
  no but the award still goes to monkey island
    thought that filter was so cool when i first started emulating eventually i realized how awful it looks smooths things out way too much so you dont notice all the neat details you come to realize a bit of pixelation is perfectly acceptable
i should go
    might be the mac version i heard it used scale2x been years since i played it on there though
  man what a weird inventory
  its very obviously hq3x still amazing to believe one of the most prolific filters scale 2x was invented by lucasarts themselves decades ago for the sole purpose of making mac ports look prettier
  quoting dead posts is bad form but yeah what you posted isnt scale 2x but rather simply hq2x
  is it the fact that the fishing rod is propped up by itself
  huh
  the other choices were shit so its not the greatest dialogue choice
  uh it is the greatest choice out of all of them so yes it is the greatest choice maybe if the question was is this the greatest selection of dialogue choices then it would be something else
  i love the bit where you go behind the wall and your actions are still narrated
can we all just agree that monkey island is one of the greatest video games of all time
    well that hardly seems like a choice at all
  go away
  
  was i the only one hit by the graphics suddenly changing to more detailed sprites
  hit
  it was odd to do it for the fisherman but monkey island and loom both had talking heads and more detailed back drops for several dialogs
  is loom worth playing i have to say that guy in monkey island really made me interested
  its worth it for a lazy afternoon just play on lowest difficulty
  its very much worth it   keep in mind that the pc cdrom version has voice acting but because of that the dialog has been trimmed music only plays at certain times and a lot of the world building was cut the fmtowns version is the best i believe but its a tradeoff with the graphics not being as good as the pc cdrom version
  monkey island always had dialogue choices just like nearly every other lucasarts adventure game at the time what are you even talking about
  hes joking
  its a fucking weirdass joke then like how cinemasins just says stupid incorrect shit in a completely serious tone of voice and only when people call them out on it do they say wwere just joking guys smug fucking pricks
  you got memed just accept it and move on
  he was referencing something that was a meme for a day and a half nothing to get worked up over     was michael jackson really big enough back then to warrant having his own game
    no i will not accept this shitty troll culture where people put zero effort into their work and smugly feel that they accomplished something because i got you mad stupid emoticon here
  you dont even know what he was feeling this is all in your head for all you actually know he was just poking fun at the retarded meme itself calm down
casting a vote for what do you think my painting could use     a little red   a little talent
  not retro but eyedc  kill them all  kill them all  kill them all
  wait that has dialogue choices i thought it was an fps or something
  its a fully fledged rpg player progression wise linear progression schlub in medieval armor  cybernetic god    dialogue choices are just there for the memes
    it has some good meme potential
    wow maybe i should play this my friend has it in his steam library and i dont think he played it a single time before he died so im not sure why he even owned it but we have family sharing on our accounts so i guess i should borrow it
  just bear in mind that its an unusual game the translation is mostly okay if a bit quaint the original text is bonkers as well except for some rare spots like the pic i posted  its grind heavy and multiple playthroughs are needed for the true ending but it is fun  get a submachinegun  shoot  it shoots very fast  secondary fire mode  it shoots extremely fast    alright ill shut my moron face up now
    best enjoyed in 4 coop  or after investing 50 hours grinding research and brouzouf for that top tier cybertech
  its a classic
  looks like the segacd version
  its not its either the mac or dos cd version since that filtering is not native to either we may never know
what
  i have never played any adventure games because i find them too hard its hard to focus on reading lot of text and then the puzzles are so cruel and abstract i cant figure anything out i understand if i need to unlock a door with key and key is hidden under a rug for example but anything more complex is out of my reach i prefer to play shooters instead i dont know why i posted this btw
  its hard to focus on reading lot of text  unless you are an esl or have literal brain damage how
  or after investing 50 hours grinding research and brouzouf for that top tier cybertech  or just get a grinding map the cycles of guilt wont wait for your slow ass legs
  i remember trying to play this game and it was so godawfully confusing from the very beginning i loved it
  me like shoot gun gun go boom  words hurt head
  i just get a headache when i try to read
  4chan must be a nightmare for you
  not really this site is full of idiots who use short and easy words probably because theyre all posting from their phones because this stupid fucking site has become a normie stronghold where all the bible thumpers think theyre welcome
  thats me
  no retard im here to stay eat shit
very nice
  reee so stupid all so stupid i cant read a book im my brain hurts    literally subhuman and hypocritical
  what the actual fuck are you on about
but where are all the monkeys
  theres a threeheaded one right behind you
  is this a new meme now
  it was a week ago
regarding classic point and click games and given theres a fuckton of them which ones would you recommend that are comedy gold but dont overuse references to other media
  i wouldnt say monkey island overuses references
  no this is
waffles innit
  sowhy was she
  ththats a she
    wasnt that the game where you can kill kids
  theres a lot of fucked up shit about that game
  whats the point of calling it a choice if its mandatory to pick
  all choices are mandatory you choose any one of them so thats why theyre called choices i suppose you could also choose to close the game
  i think i remember dialogue of the mother wanting to fuck the son
  yikes
  youre a big guy 
  with this attitude /vr/ will survive meme inflation thank you
  cool blog post faggot
  i dont know what meme inflation means but i do find that the smaller boards on this site have less memespamming retards because they all generally stay on /tv/ and /v/
  grew up playing the cd version of monkey island went from c64 to 486 era in one jump monkey island was my first ever game on cd that inventory fucking takes me back do the newer releases us it or the older text based inventory
  they do and they dont what it is is that the retards can feed on a single thread a lot longer than faster boards there is a lot of meme posting and baiting here but they just stay in threads that were prime for it like that one collection thread with the house fire they dont shit this thread becuase that old one is still going strong for days after its creation on /v/ it would be dead an hour or two after creation but those shitposters still want yous so they drift to other threads
  interesting
  dunno loved these choices
i do not condone violence against women
  why was he in such a hurry
  time spent talking is time not spent eating
  thank you
  holy shit is this real i dont remember that one though played a lot of the game back in the days
  yep
  iirc the actor playing the part of the main character got convicted for child pornography
  yikes
  where do you get a samurai sword
hm
  underrated
  oh long johnson
oh don piano
  star control 2 has the best dialoge options after vtmb

  ha    i get it
we fucking won
  actions  spill spaghetti out of pocket  try to contain your spaghetti discharge   do 180 and run as fast as your legs can handle
well that was nice not having to keep track of this for a day
was this thread acting weird for anyone else for a minute
  you know what to do  zip
  shiiiiiiiiiit
  wankers that they are
  i always thought it was an inside joke for pic related even the hat and clothes fit
  nah monkey island predates that
  its from 1942
  and 1942 came out in 1984 checkmate
  even the hat and clothes fit  what the fuck are you talking about those hats are different those shirts are different the only thing that is common are the colours
  this one obviously
  hits bong i dunno man two wieners hahaha
heh
  what game is this
      pretty sure
tunnel snakes rule
    how appropriate you fight like a cow    tfw just discovered that ron gilbert made a new lucasartsstyle point and click available on all platforms  downloaded it and  im enjoying the shit out of it
    monkey island sam  max hit the road
buckle up    the backwards bus
  to be honest arbitrary solutions to puzzles can be frustrating and i played a lot of adventure games back in the day i
  i  what did he mean by this
  now where could my pipe be
  im so glad i found toastyfrog all those years ago
  what was his problem
  what was his problem
  what was his problem
  yes monkey island references an image that would become a meme 20 years later fucking retard
  he means the meme/gag of it there is nothing funny about the ad by itself
  she killed jon icaruss lover so he cursed her with that form and enchanted the spiders to feed her to keep her alive
  jon icarus who comes up with this crap
wah
  seeing someone get this upset over getting memed in this day and age makes me feel young again much more so than hanging on a retro gaming board
  why would hanging on a retro gaming board make you feel young again you sure are an idiot
  take your meds anon some people still feel joy you decision to attack such an innocent comment is revealing
  yyou mad bro haha  yikes
  close
i bought the special edition bundle and hory shet the hd graphics are ugly they dont look pleasant by their own merits and together with the choppy sprite movement of the old engine it just looks like shit it would be sweet to play with voice acting  old graphics but thats not an option in the menu there is a mod for that but it seems little shady to me
  youre on /vr/ and yet youre scared of shady mods    wait i suppose this board is full of people who would rather pay hundreds of dollars for an old copy of a game with the intention of playing it rather than keeping it in mint condition when they could literally just emulate it if thats their goal so maybe thats not too unlikely
  the classic boxed version never had voice acting i just cant understand why the people behind this remaster didnt think people would like to have best of both worlds i believe monkey islan 2 hd has that option straight from the menu no mods required
  why would bathing in nostalgia make you feel young again  go away
  no you go way
how is this thread still alive
  what can i say people really like talking about great dialogue choices in video games
  ghost bumping
  im playing that version of mi2 right now so far ive only encountered one glitch where the music didnt stop when i moved to a new area but i could fix it easily by muting the game for a moment ive played it for quite a while feels great to play the original game on dos with voice acting and mt32 music id say just go for it
  guybrush has a good voice actor i wish he was in more stuff
jonah
tfw beaten the first monkey island  what a god tier game im starting with the sequel today its going to be great
  the second one is even better dont bother with curse though its shit that only people blinded with nostalgia would recommend guybrush is shallow the plot is meh lechuck is a meme the game itself has something missing the distinct style choices discussions and overall flow maybe
  fuck you dude curse is great and im not speaking from nostalgia because i played them all for the first time just a few years ago its escape that nobody likes are you sure you didnt confuse it with that    the only part of curse that sucks and i feel obligated to mention it to everyone so theyre not blindsided by it like i was is that it literally does not have an ending from what i understand they must have run out of time or something you just beat lechuck and boom you basically get a you win screen and thats it like an old nes game or something
  i didnt confuse nothing you fag curse is just as bad as escape monkey island died with two and with ron gilbert
  then shut up you fucking moron you know nothing
  i played this game when you were inside the balls of your father you absolute retard shut up cunt
  i highly doubt that you fucking troglodyte you absolute dipshit
lol i am screencapping you faggots  lucasarts quests are shit anyway
  rubber chicken  all of my hate
  this is like how people screencap their bans as if a ban with a canned message is in any way worth showing off people pick the most inconsequential shit to screencap these days
  canned message
  yeah nice 2007 screencap retard obviously not what im referring to    and by the way whoever originally got that ban is probably not laughing about it now because thats the kind of shit that gets the fbi sent after you
  be phone poster  occasionally get ip someone else got banned  ban message is always a copy paste of one of the rules and nothing else  apparently there are people with my provider cheerfully posting cp from their government tracking devices who havent been gotten busted in years so im not so sure about that latter point
  yes
  except 4chan mods do send the information of someone who does something illegal to the fbi so it is very likely that they know exactly what those people are doing
      i thought it was a reference to the garfield comic
  why the fuck would you think that
  just appeal it you spastic
  appeals are slow and inefficient he should probably go directly to irc for something like that
  muh gilbert  you can see just how soso it would be under gilbert by playing thimbleweed park   curse and even escape are both better than it and most games gilberts worked on since humongous and cavedog
  no point i could submit one but id never see the result my phones ip gets changed every time i lose signal or leave the connection idle more than a few minutes
  thats hot
  if everyone appeals bans like that neither they nor anyone else will end up getting impended by that particular ip ban again    i assume they mostly go through i doubt the mods go man that pedo we banned for cp in 2012 is trying to trick us into unbanning him so he can make his first post on 4chan in 6 years but were not falling for it
  no not really
  opinions arent facts
  yours arent his are
  your opinion doesnt matter too buddy so is the internet im sorry but rules are rules
  im pretty sure they already know its a dynamic/phone block of ips because the bans are always 1 or 3 days even for the most egregioussounding shit
  i never understood why they dont give out rangebans to ban evaders more often they seem to be content to give them tiny bans no matter what and you know it forces people to buy passes if they want to get through its winwin    failing that you know what i dont see enough of threadbans so many stupid rulebreaking threads get hundreds of posts in under an hour because this site is fucking full of idiots who straight up come to the video game board to argue about politics for example giving even a short ban to every single person who posted in the thread would be a good way to scare them off posting in them because they know theyre risking a ban if they do
that makes sense
  haista paska
  im the anon you replied to finally got down to playing the game and ive finished part 1 i have to say that the writing at least for now is inferior to the first monkey island theres also way more obscure and bullshit puzzles like having to use the pick up command on a sign and get a shovel which looked like it was drawn on the sing or picking up that npcs monocle when he put it on the desk and somehow figuring out its an adequate replacement for a necklace i already used the walkthrough three times and for the first monkey island ive used the walkthrough three times in total the story is pretty interesting though i hope the game gets better
  my big disappointment with mi2 is that they put nice thing on a lot of the things you examine because they clearly didnt feel like writing lines for any of them granted it becomes more entertaining when you have voice acting theres some particularly irritating puzzles in chapter 2 you have to look forward to as well frankly i think when a point and click requires you to find some tiny little thing that is easily mistaken for a background object it has failed at design
so this is smash
  the third game has voice acting right ive been planning on playing that one too but not immediately after i finished the second game
        xd upboated
  appeal phone ip ban  okay now youre permanently banned for being a dynamic ip
  yep i remember being surprised at just how good the voice acting was for a game from that long ago too honestly i dont think you would even have a problem if you played it right after 2 because thats what i did and i was very impressed but whatever floats your boat
  calm down
its such a good game
  its a sabre and you buy it from the general store after you rob his safe
  be forewarned its confusing and weird and takes some effort to get into but its rewarding and broken as shit when you master it    also it has multiplayer coop for like what 16 players    anyways its crazy and a diamond in the extreme rough just remember to upgrade your legs
jesus christ slide this fucking thread to nirvana already
  why is there a blue fleshlight in his inventory
  because thats actually mentos the freshmaker buy a pack today
  i get this too occasionally    surreal to think someone on the same isp seems to think nothing of doing deranged shit that could easily land them jail time
  this site is full of people who are fucked up in the head
yeet

  whats this
  breath of fire iv kino
  i had a weird feeling it was breath of fire even though i havent played one of those games just had that look    is that supposed to be a snake girl because that would be cool i dont remember many of those in the early 2000s
what a large fellow
  why are 13 and 14 truth and lie when they both effectively say the same thing
  14 claims the mc is forever changed specifically because of her beauty
  whats her deal
  for the same reason a phrase like i love you can be true or a lie      no
  the intention of your words too theres a couple times where you can say the exact same thing truth or lie and it checks your charisma vs theirs or something
  niin sitä pitää
  ii waana tako
  usually its your charisma vs their wisdom when you try to lie ravel however always knows when youre lying interestingly she often doesnt care she likes to hear you compliment her even if she knows youre lying
  id imagine someone who looks like that will take any compliment they can get
g
  you the master of unlocking
slightly out of /vr/ territory though
  this one is so strange
  its honestly one of the most horrific things youll ever see in a video game that whole dungeon is this castle with gross pulsating flesh growing all around it and once you reach the end you find out that the source is that girl there whose been transformed into a horrible akira monster
  well that is definitely quite an unfortunate thing for it to be instead of a cute snek

this thread is like /s4s/ /vr/ edition
  no she actually thinks the attempt to deceive her is part of your charm your lying is sweet
  at first i thought this was a point  click adventure games thread
  well theres two hundred posts left for it to become that
  well those monkey island games have been on my backlog for a while 10 years so if i ever get around to them ill make sure to post my thoughts
  10 years  thats about how much longer this thread will last
wahoo  klonoa
  107 day old thread still up  impressive
  underrated    star control 2 does have the best dialogue options but that really is clearly not a good example of them
  sammax htr
  planescape torment  sorry op
  what exactly makes this the greatest choice in history
  i went to /cm/ looking for astolfo pictures yesterday and the thread there is over five months old whats so impressive about 107 days    and before you ask yes i will share my haul
  huh
  the fact is that the secret disgraceful shit you think that you and only you do and is your deepest darkest secret isnt really that uncommon or a big deal
  what game
  you realize the deranged shit in this context is literally pedophilia you fucking retard id say that is both uncommon and a big fucking deal follow the conversation next time
  curse is great youre just mad

  what would be a good way to play ntsc in a pal reigon i am not very knowledgeable on connections but still would like a decent look from a crt
  reposting my question
im at a loss i got a vga monitor and its been working with dreamcast vga just fine but every time i try and connect it to a pc it just rapidly seems to connect and disconnect no matter what i do please help
  a vga/dvi pc monitor there is a lot more to what you just asked that needs answering if it is a pc monitor just put it at the native resolution at 60hz and be done with it why even bother with attempting to force 240p on a pc monitor if you have never seen it in person it is shit or wont work at all    crt emudriver and all of that shit is more geared for a regular consumer crt or professional crt pvmlike than a 31khz pc monitor    what i said could be different if the pc monitor accepts 15khz natively with some rgb like connection
  did you try changing the resolution of the pc and only using that monitor how are you connecting to it that happens sometimes if you try to do too much higher res and hz than it can accept accumulative
  ive tried connecting it with dvi to vga and recently a hdmi to vga box ive tried setting it to lower resolutions too and stuff that it should accept but it isnt
  if you have an hdmi to vga box of some type try and connect anything else you have to that monitor like a ps3 or x1 or anything     what monitor also try a really low resolution too like 800x600 or lower assuming it is 4x3 at 60hz possible it doesnt like conversion to vga and wants native vga to put it simply
  its a viewsonic e70f  i tried using the ps3 with it but apparently the box is compliant with hdcp so it was constantly flickering off and on unfortunately i tried setting it to 800 x 600 but it was still doing it too
  lol damn i forgot ps3 had that i paid big bucks to get an hdcp stripper 10 years ago for that    i honestly only have one thing that you can try it might only like hd dsub inputs so potentially the dc vga box is that type but everything else you have is not you might have to try to find another dongle/adapter that supports the right 15pin output to the monitor although it could be far easier than that i just cant imagine anything else being the issue    i use a tendak hdmi to vga and it works on all my pc crts great the best i have found actually for color and contrast
  wonder if i can replace the one i have since it just arrived today i didnt think about that part when i got it
      that one is about as good as it gets for the price i have a few now as i want replacements if it breaks or i lose it no delay tested with a scope and doesnt crush the blacks or anything shitty like that     as for dvi to vga there are a lot of different types of those dongles and cables handshaking shouldnt work in some cases if you have the wrong one or the cables sometimes just dont fit lol but connecting and disconnecting is usually a mismatched timing issue so sort of unrelated to a wrong dongle if you tried all the resolutions and even tried to reset the monitor to default and all of that i would say it is that dvi to vga dongle if that doesnt work maybe someone else has ideas
  do you know if this supports 2304x144080hz
  how does that thing compare to this do you have any of these  
  for rgb consoles most tvs with a scart jack  for composite/svideo most mid 90s and newer
  no for meme high resolutions the sunix dpu3000 is the usual recommendation
  snes owning friend of mine owned pocky  rocky and wild guns  he said they were both stupid games and didnt know why his parents got them  he sold them for chump change  mfw he regrets it to this day
  that price ouch cheers anon been looking for a solution for ages
i wanted to take this beast home so badly but i dont have a van or enough space in my house to store it i love the craftsmanship of the wood and it appear to have a radio built in or a record player the tvs been sitting outside my work and will probably go to the trash soon rip 70s wood console tv beauty    wow hes pretty stupid to throw gems like that away
im completely new to the concept of craigslist how do i make sure i dont get raped
  bring a friend to help carry the tv
  be unattractive
  take the tubes at least retard
  im looking at 17 max
  also  friends
  went into a sketchy cleveland suburb the other day to buy two crts off of a guy ended up being perfectly fine but i brought two other guys just in case left our wallets in the car the two guys were helpful to actually load the tvs into my car anyway so id recommend bringing someone with you regardless was a tight squeeze with two crts and three guys in such a small car though
  bring a gun
      i tried that before buying the other one the issue was the transfer method was losing on the low end i didnt notice it until i think half life or quake i forget but it was almost impossible to tell        even though it was already answered the sunix is good but expensive the tendak actually goes higher than 1600x1200 at 85 but i cant recall just how high i had it i think it was 18561392 at 85
  i just did some research apparently the first one i had is different than they are now both those tendak devices are the same internally now    picture related of it not crushing blacks or causing issues
more like this
free 32 inch jvc tv in my area  owner is possibly willing to drop it off  says it works but no idea what to do if i need to repair it  this is important how hard would it be to fix this thing up if i get it  it needs something like a capacitor replacement or if something goes wrong with the component jacks in the back these were all shadowmask so theyre not nearly as good for games as a trinitron right i really doubt im going to be able to throw it away or even move it around much if i commit to accepting it from this guy its nearly 200 pounds    /fit/ laughing in the distance 
  thats the sort of thing youre going to regret not putting into storage at the very least you could take the tube or the wooden frame  do a swap seeing a similar sized trinitron running rgb in that with a new record player on the side would be a great restoration project if all the components are trashed
this pic turned out worse than the previous not sure why
  you dont see relic from the past like that every day what i should have done was post that pic on craigslist for someone else to salvage it i think its gone by now if i had a truck or van i would have took it home those console tvs are still around because they make great furniture
  its usually not worth it
newbie when it comes to crts here how do i check if my tv has rgb support or not it doesnt have the three red green and blue entrances that i can tell only red white and yellow
is there anyway to fix this type of glow under am its on my 32 sharp crt sdtv im using component cables i am able to get into the service menu if it can be fixed there but theres a thousand different values to change and in the manual i dont know what half of them even mean
  crt tvs in the usa dont have rgb scart rgb tvs are a pal and ntscj region thing but there are usa tvs that have component which is basically the same quality as rgb the green blue red cables are called component    if your crt only has yellow white red it means composite cables are the best you can do composite is mediocre quality
    not pictured
  that looks like internal reflection in the glass itself in which case it cannot be fixed only reduced by turning the contrast down
  is it viable for a regular person to take apart a crt tv and remove the glass from the tube to clean the inside
  dangerous but yes its possible be sure you discharge the tube  follow all safety procedures
  not viable for anyone unless you mean one of the few tvs with a separate sheet in front of the actual screen
  good lord congrats on falling for the meme zoomer/reddit
  man this image is extremely fucking sharp is that a 31khz monitor or a pvm
  ive seen sharper
  in a word no    turn the contrast down and live with it
  flat screen  pass
  that is not actually very sharp its just a high res source being downscaled giving that illusion
where do gba games belong i can either do 480i component with my wii connected to a crt or play them on a 1080p lcd monitor with integer scaling i guess
  no its a vga monitor specifically an adi microscan pd697 if thats the case what benefit does it give me over my current monitor other than proper blacks
  i personally emulate them on my crt running the resolution at 240x180 with other handhelds i just set my crts resolution to the nearest 43 resolution that still allows 11 mapping like 480x360 for psp
  i just set my crts resolution  how do i do this or is this a pc only thing
  i use xrandr on linux but you can also use soft15khz and cru on windows   im reasonably sure its a pconly thing sorry
  i can either do 480i component with my wii connected to a crt  160p windowboxed in 240p is also an option
  best way imo since integer scaling 2x would make it go over 240p if u want scanlines
would anyone know why the speakers connected to my crt dont output a lower volume the default sound is pretty loud and it doesnt actually play any sound until i rotate the volume wheel for quite a bit
    why do people get so angry at people who want their picture to look the absolute best
  game
am i suppose to use a sharpness setting of zero or somewhere in the middle
the vga cable i ordered for my dreamcast came in today ill share some pics of 480p goodness on my samsung syncmaster 900 once i get off work in a few hours
  probably bad speakers or insufficient amplification for the speakers youre using try lower impedance speakers or run the audio from your tv into a stereo receiver and connect the speakers to the receiver
  on a gba with ags101 screen mod
  what speakers connected how
  does the sound seem crackly when you turn the dial if so you might need to use contact cleaner on the dial the inside part not the plastic corrosion might be preventing it from working in the lower area
  i think quality wise the speakers are pretty good they are  you might be right about the insufficient amplification though although im not sure not too keen on audio    nah no problems like that the issue is that its dead silent until i turn the dial for some bit and when audio does output its pretty loud
  ff1
  on a pvm knob default is zero you should stay close to it
  depends on the tv/monitor on some going all the way to the bottom is intentionally blurring so should set it to the middle on others 0 is just no sharpening which is what you want    or you might want a bit of a sharpening effect try it out and see what you prefer
  raise it as high as you want until you start seeing artifacts to the edge of contrasty transitions if youve got something with 240p test suite it has a specific pattern just for adjusting sharpness you keep an eye on the diagonal lines and wait until you see artifacts coming off of them to the right then back off a bit
are there any motherboards that have displayport alt mode so i can use a converter thinking about upgrading my pc anyway
i bought a jvc tm150cg recently and it came in basically perfect condition very happy with it and i will be testing it out using a ps2 and maybe snes soon no rgb input without an expansion card though  what would be the best method for watching 480p/576p video on it i have heard that the wii video player is a decent solution and i do have an old wii laying around do vga to svideo/composite adapters create too many problems even if you force the output resolution to an appropriate resolution i am also looking into the soft 15khz program mentioned in thread
  it cant do 480p/576p
  nice postage stamp
  i know it would have to be 480i but would that be a possible output by downscaling the video or are there too many obstacles in the way
  soft 15khz is no good for windows versions newer than xp    
  good link i will definitely be going through this and seeing what is available to me if i recall the model correctly my laptop card should be compatible
  xbox 360 / ps3 can be useful do pretty clean 480/576i out and have enough performance to handle modern encoding / hd which the wii really cant     og xbox can also be a nice option for sd stuff with decently network performance playback capabilities in terms of codec support arent much better than a wii but youve got nicer software the original xbmc    getting 480/576i directly out of a vga port is kinda tricky under windows especially if not an amd card that crt emudriver can run quite a bit easier under linux    also buy my rgb/component card should be back tomorrow
why do people like such thick scanlines to me it just looks distracting subtlety is best
  not sure which but its one of my vga monitors would be either a 930sb p810 or 915ft running 240p120hz with retroarch
  i find pc monitors too sharp tbqph
  oh dont worry anon i absolutely think so as well the memelines are thick and headache inducing i prefer to just play in 480p if im emulating or on my 36 tv i only took those pics because i was doing a comparison between the three mentioned monitors and 240p was one of the things i tested
could those big woofers seated on the top of the crt cause longterm damage to the tube
  sony sets damage themselves without a subwoofer so i doubt that helps much
  sony sets damage themselves without a subwooferwait what even pvms or are you just saying consumer sets what fails exactly
just picked up a sony wega kv36fs120 mainly because of its size so far im in love with it as i dont need supersharp pixels pic is tempo on my 32x via composite
  its built for it so its gotta be magnetically shielded theyll be fine unless you can directly observe warping or something when theres a lot of bass playing through it youre fine
  are you the kiwi on ebay
  yep
  whats up
  new cards
  thats cool is there any specific reason you only put audio passthrough on the cards
  these ones have the option for audio to the monitor too passthrough is handy for scart so that you dont need a separate breakout
    yeah i kind of wish my card could put audio through to the monitor
  hacked gamecube booting swiss into the gameboy interface homebrew with gbplayer attached forced to 240 or 480p
  why are lcds so blocky
i have a panasonic bt1390yn 14 monitor that i found for free but apparently somebody recently posted a listing for a sony pvm 2030 on my local classifieds for 115 should i get it the guy was apparently concerned about how it has no service menu or something
  youre unlikely to find another one locally that cheap so yeah jump on it i guess you could always flip it later for a profit if you dont like it    lack of service menu isnt really a big deal if you have the maintenance manual and a shred of common sense
  older pvms dont have on screen display menus everything is adjusted through a bunch of potentiometers under the enclosure its sad to say but 115 is relatively cheap these days id try to haggle him down to 100 at least
  meet in a public place otherwise bring people you trust if thats not an option    any monitor that cant be brought over to a starbucks to close a deal will probably require extra people anyways just to move it around
  been trying to play mgs on a 14 tv but damn i guess im just too used to bigger tvs have no problem with a really old shitty 21 but 14 seems impossible i honestly cant play on it    tried bloody roar and i did fine but for something like mgs it was just too much
am i sitting too close to the monitor    i think so yeah im looking for a smaller armchair
  no try a taller stand or shorter chair though
  how often do you hit your head
  i am a manlet i dont have to worry just about 4 feet tall
  shorter chair then the place us cramped enough as it is but i like it      not at all truth be told i do hit my head often enough when im getting up from bed tho
    those rocker chairs are actually pretty good for low to the ground shit at least the more comfier ones that you can lock in place not the ones with speakers though
  i was actually thinking of getting one of these   a friend has one and its pretty comfy
  14 is best for 2d
hey ive got a shitty general electric  xs stereo commercial skip that i got from my parents and theres some really shitty image alignment issues with it cant find anything in the general video menus nor are there any sort of physical adjustment knobs  anybody here knowledgeable on this tv or have any ideas
looks pretty circular on my set
  i hate being so up close and trapped when it comes to gaming id rather be in a free computer chair or laying down when gaming but honestly can only do laying down if its a super relaxed game
  ok do you need to take your meds or something
  rf looks nostalgic
  he doesnt know it should be an oval
  ive been years on a computer chair o honestly cant stand it anymore  and laying down on bad and playing games dont mix for me  leaning on my couch or on that chair is a lot more comfortable for me nowadays
  thats fair i mean desu i dont even play that much vidya just horde the goods
what happens when the supply of crts dries up are we fucked   because while retro fans have a lot of disposable income to spend on dumb bullshit i rather doubt you could for example kickstart a crt manufacturing company due to the expensive machinery hazardous and valuable materials eg copper involved in their construction
  this post  makes no sense in this thread it would seem he forgot to take his medicine today and is posting about threads from years ago right here and now
  nigga  
  so it is agreed it doesnt belong here good for you
    we could start a business for 14 20 27 inch pro level crts and sell them for 600 800 1200 all day long the issue is waste of materials and electricity on a large scale    as an owner of several types of crts i use my oled and my about as much as my tubes no lcd blur actual black blacks with under a frame of total delay is nearly indistinguishable from a pvm unless you really look in fact it is better than plenty of crts that have more than a frame of delay because long winded reasons
  there should be people set up to take trolls to prison only underage or incel neets would attempt trolling after 2012
  no lcd blur  isnt oled still samplehold how would it have no blur  also i still cant find any shader that gives me nonblocky scanlines without becoming a blurry mess
  so ive been thinking about an oled not to replace crt but for my main living room tv what upscaler do you use to play retro on it i dont mean how but which one do you use on your set do you like it or would you do something differently all my consoles are already rgb modded so the major obstacle is done
  are you fucking retarded its clearly a pic of a crt it belongs here fuck off
i have a sony evm9010pr does anyone know if it can play both ntsc and pal tapes
hopefully any experts here can chime in i just picked up an old 80s woodgrain rca tv for a song the tv turns on fine with the usual snow but whenever i screw on a coaxial cable the tv immediately turns off ive tried 2 game consoles a vcr different coaxial cables no luck if i have the power off to the systems the tv comes right back on fine only when it suddenly sends a signal does it flick off i managed to one time plug the coaxial in with the system on and the game picture showed up but it was wobbly in the middle and slowly rolling most of the time though it will just immediately turn itself off when something is plugged in am i screwed
  we could start a business for 14 20 27 inch pro level crts and sell them for 600 800 1200 all day long  lets do it  i cant provide much startup capital but id buy stock at least
finally got a key for the drawer on my bvm 2016p  if i understand correctly the tube has been used for 75 641 hours should i be worried    i cant seem to find any information regarding expected lifespan of these tubes neither can i seem to find any information about issues you could expect with an tube reaching the end of its life
are old crt dangerous for radiation and shit
  if youre not seeing burn in and its still pretty bright dont worry about it       those prices are far below what sony etc were selling them for new when they were making thousands at a time id expect prices at least 10 times that to make them today on a scale retro nerds might be willing to buy them for even totally ignoring the prices of getting hazardous materials exemptions youd need to get them into any first world country      theres a bit of xray emission unless you intentionally disable/break the safety shutdowns or shielding its not enough to worry about      doubt it
my sister has a sanyo flat screen with component in  am i right in thinking its probably a digital set and not worth my time  i planned on getting a pvm soon anyway
  if its not hd and its not widescreen its probably fine for vr use
  heres the problem buddy those 20inch pro crts cost 10000 new youre delusional if you think a startup company with no experience in the field can beat the prices of a company like sony on sophisticated equipment like that
  theres a bit of xray emission unless you intentionally disable/break the safety shutdowns or shielding its not enough to worry about  i got an old ass crt from a random acquaintance probably from the 80s buttons on the remote are completely washed out it had a long life for sure maybe it needs a little maintenance  it seems to run fine btw its there any way to know if the shielding is still ok  tangentially do old crt have insect infestations like old console
  80s set should be fine for the shielding its in the glass infestations possibly
thoughts on the kv36hs510 did these trinitrons with dvi ports in the back do rgb by extension ive never seen one with a port like this in the back  have no idea if they would lag could you use them as vga monitors or something really weird trinitron  ive never seen one for sale
  im no expert but those are on hd sets that have a specific native resolution with a small amount of lag and every other resolution has a lot of lag
so a few weeks back i posted i got a jvc iart for free on craigslist i was ecstatic one problem the entire lower half of the crts image seems to shake a bit from side to side i chalked this up to bad caps  left it be for 2 weeks  checked again same issue only this time i also noticed it a bit on my bvmd24e1wu to a much lesser extent so process of elimination starts    idea 1 my ps2s power cord must suck    changed between 3 power cords  no change    idea 2 my component cables are garbage because theyre third party    swapped to an official sony svideo cable same shaking problem    idea 3 my ps2 is dying    switched from my slim ps2 to my fat ps2 to my 60gb ps3 same issue across all models in 240p    idea 4 my power strip that feeds my ps2  crt must be going bad    i plugged both the systems  tv directly into the wall same issue    idea 5 maybe all ps2s do this  ive never noticed    booted up my analogue nt mini hooked up to my d24 in rgb with monoprice cables also shows this exact issue again just slightly less      so here i am out of options the only thing i can think of is either im getting magnetic interference in my neighborhood or the electricity from my wall is somehow carrying a magnetic pulse any idea what could cause a crts image to shake a bit from side to side i know what 480i shaking is  this isnt that every test i did was with 240p sources  it shows up a bit in 480i too
  would not having your crt plugged into a voltage regulator cause a lot of distortion thats the real question here
  no the dvi port is for digital in its hd scales anything you put in to 1080i or 540p has some lag
astal is a good fuckin video game but i need to get a better svideo cable for my saturn im getting quite a bit of crosstalk from this cheap one
i just got a bo mx4000 and im struggling to properly adjust the geometry settings through the service menu i messed around in the 240p test suite for a couple hours trying to make the grid test look nice but every time i thought it looked decent the linearity and scrolling tests would look off     i dont even really understand what im supposed to be aiming for if i cant make it perfect are the outer edges of the red squares in the grid test supposed to be visible on screen it seems impossible to get the image linear so things get distorted when scrolling near the edges     ive skimmed through the guide in the op but id really not want to open the tv i dont know what im doing and dont trust myself
  i forgot to add the outer circles in the linearity test seemed to extend offscreen no matter my geometry settings is that normal are they supposed to perfectly fit in the screen or is the sole purpose of that test just to see how round the circles are which is somewhat difficult when they go offscreen    i also just remembered being confused as to whether or not i should be changing some settings inside the 240p test suite due to having a pal tv so if i am supposed to i havent been
i remember an anon posting a few thread ago a list of every family of products in the sony crt range and their relations to each other iirc it included stuff like cdm gdm ldm and other lesser known stuff   anyone has that list saved 
  nvm i found it   i was interested in what the kx range really was since i just picked up a kx14cp1
    fuck it im just going to buy a voltage regulator  see if that helps any i just checked some old style lightbulbs in my house  they do flicker a bit from time to time almost everything points to that being the solution will post back with results once the vr comes in the mail if thats really the issue then this is one of the most important things crt fans never talk about
  ive actually found one or two more but they seem to have been used for only one or two sets and are just slightly niche versions of an existing kv set    ckv specifically which i can only assume is a commerical designated tv
potentially a good deal for someone in the florida area would need to see if they all functioned properly though  
picking up a nice 25 inch sony this evening gonna get real comfy hooking up my old ps1 with a nice rgb cable modern games have gotten shittier and scummier every year its gonna be good to play the classics as intended
  is that from ikea i have to agree then my wife had one she used to use for reading but i basically stole it to play video games on because it was the perfect height
    actually just a headsup i bought a second one not too long ago and i notice its much softer especially the back support seems like there are two different styles of cushions the one on the left here is the soft one while the one on the right is definitely more firm both are comfy but its something to keep in mind because i was expecting them to be identical apart from color
  yes it is    im getting one next month before christmas
  i see thanks for the heads up
  please keep us updated anon im intrigued
    great setup anon close to ideal   heres a very old pic of my setup dont have room for crts in my current flat but when i start my phd next year ill have space got a lovely bang and olufsen me6000 amongst others i can set up itll be my ideal
whats the biggest crt monitor i can get did they make any of them bigger than 19
  my friend had one that was 24 i cant say ive seen one bigger than that but i wouldnt doubt they might exist
  the biggest one you should shoot for is 21 inch that was a tube size that got a lot of love without being cheap    there is a sony 24 inch 1610 but i would hardly say that is ideal paying what people want for a fw900
  19inch cue evil laugh do you really want to know   42 inch mitsubishi megaview   sony kx45ed1 45 inch  someone here was going to import one direct from japan but never updated   sony hdm3830 a pioneering hdvs hivision display dating as far back as the 80s weighing over 400 pounds and costing nearly 100k with a curved crt saw one on ebay in the last decade plus 
  wanted to add at 38 inches the hdm3830 is the largest 16x9 pro crt produced those coffin like handles on the one in the video are their for a reason  moving it needs more than 2 pallbearers
    you might have missed what he was asking he clearly was asking about computer monitors
      boys
  he clearly was asking about computer monitors  clearly  please point out where computer monitors are referred to here    whats the biggest crt monitor i can get did they make any of them bigger than 19    nowhere a crt monitor means things such as pvms
  make sure the floor is strong enough  not the stand but the floor shit done got real
  you fucking tool a crt computer monitor is literally a crt monitor its not just your pvmemes i dunno whether youre dumb underage or both
  nowhere a crt monitor means things such as pvms  imagine being this ignorant
  sperg triggering intensifies  now now why so belligerent shit for brains a crt monitor could even refer to a tv with composite video idiot as i have had tv sets which called themselves monitors     just because you and your boyfriend only denote desktop computer monitors with the appellation crt monitor over your circle jerk does not make it standard usage     now go back to watching lgr videos and paying 500 for an isa soundcard pc tard
  go away idiot stop being a try hard idiot and follow the discussion context is your friend if you can get your dumbass to understand it
  holy shit you are mad dont be so mad you couldnt understand a simple question
  imagine being this autistic  see  bitch your circlejerk with  is not a view held by the population not on the spectrum this is based on experience buying this shit before this site existed and likely before you were born snowflake
    see  and dont come back until you regain your composure
  all of these look amazing the kx45ed1 is particularly fascinating to me as it seems to have bnc rgb inputs despite being a consumer set
  pvm means pvm lmao retard doesnt mean crt monitor     tw/l3a3
    yup it checks out you are wrong and upset about it pic related    stop talking to all of us as if we are two people
  looking awesome
          leave and stay gone kid
    may as well end your circlejerk right here what do you see in the picture go cry yourself to sleep now that your illusions of childhood have been smashed
  fuck you faggot what do you see in    ill tell you what an instant austism test as good as a color blindness card
i was talking about pc crts guess i should have been more clear i call consumer sets crt tvs and pvms  bvms well pvms  bvms    thanks for all the helpful responses gonna be on the lookout for a good 21 one
    still not understanding the context of the first question asked  still double posting in hopes people will affirm his incorrect description in confusion as if it is two people    did you know they also used the word monitor for specific speaker types still isnt what the original question was asking dont be so upset that again your dumbass is being dragged through the mud
  literally everyone calls consumer sets crts    pvms as pvms/bvms/procrts    crt monitors are crt monitors 31khz for this  idiot that doesnt get it
  so what would you call this a crt monitor its a crt and a monitor by definition a monitor does not have a tv tuner its not a pvm not a tv not raster scan yet remains a crt monitor     just admit defeat like a man everyone is entitled to a mulligan now and then
  despite being a consumer set  thats because its just a consumer facing variant of the pvm4300        22 is as large as youll find 43 wise 24 for the two wide sonys or 28 if you find the carmack special intergraph    megaviews and necs presentation sets could be seen as someone equivalent given their ability to sync across a range of frequencies like pc crts and not being locked down like pvms and bvms
  crt monitors are crt monitors 31khz for this  you idiot that doesnt get it  lol lets see you feed that 31khz signal into this  crt monitor used in vector games
  this unit weighs approximately 440lb make sure floor is strong enough  no thanks id rather have a 4k oled and buy a converter for analog
i cant imagine being so socially inept as to miss obvious meaning then have tantrum when youre called out take a break from 4chan sperg bro
testing out some new games ive got for my saturn
this is also a really great shooter
mega drive rf
woke up today and my ps1 is producing really nasty horizontal green flickering lines on the crt out of nowhere and it wasnt doing it last night anyone know what the hell this is
  its really not that game is a piece of shit its fun for one or two runthroughs because of the unusual bosses and whatnotthe karaoke level is particularly memorable but its not skillbased at all and you can tell they knew that because youre forced to play with unlimited continues on the saturn port
kya where are you from  lets have a megaview party
    70s    might be solid state or hybrid
bvm 9044d  mega drive 60hz ish rgb  love this lil guy
  forgot pic
earljam and toe
  on a set so small its a bit silly to underscan like that    looks really nice though
  in orbit around the smoldering remains of the intergalactic space arcade
what goes in the plugs on the left they do not look like regular composite
  they are regular composite just using a bnc plug instead of rca you can buy simple passive adapters on ebay or amazon just search bnc to rca adapter
  youll need these doobries
  thanks was trying to search but couldnt get the right terms
  you should probably stick to svideo if at all possible its a much nicer signal and if thats a production or security monitor it wont have a good comb filter if it even has one
  its just the way the screens been calibrated pressing the underscan goes from black border to even more of a border the pic is the larger size not much i can do about that without a calibration
  i would like to congratulate you on falling for the pvmeme and paying inflated prices for a product you know nothing about
  tripfag and an eceleb watching fag  gotta filter you
can i connect my computer which has a vga out to my crt which has a svideo input would something like this with a male to male svideo cable work
  what is 22/44khz
eat shit dracula
  you say that as if adjusting the raster size isnt a two minute ordeal
  i dont have the service manual and i cant find it online guessing i have to open it up and adjust a few pots im new to b/pvms so i have no idea what to look for
  then just do it people complaining about tripfags are worse than tripfags you realize that telling them you are gonna filter them gives them the attention they desire and also derails the thread heres a picture from a crt so im also not being totally off topic
  i dont even watch cgr just happen to be in the same city  _ツ_/        this should apply relatively closely your model is a modified version of the pvm8044or 9044 for euro that replaces the two battery compartments with an sdi option the pots should be located in about the same locations be sure to double check their markings    
  cheers thinking i should be adjusting the horizontal and vertical blanking im guessing it could throw off the rest of the geometry which worries me
  assuming the geometry on the thing is fine squares are square not rectangles circles are circles not ovals hsize and vsize should be all thats necessary if you can throw up the 240p test suite grid pattern getting the red dots centered at the edge of the visible raster is what i learn towards    only reason i mentioned anything is the visible palette data at the bottom
thoughts on sony trinitron wega 36 inch im thinking about buying one
what does /crt/ think about the rgb mod you can do to the menu circuitry in a tv
  not really worth the effort most of the time imo unless you really cannot find and afford a decent set with component and a transcoder
  no youd need an actual transcoder that adaptor is for things that do svideo/composite on ver a vga connector
  can be pretty sweet for getting similar to arcade results on a murican non flat set
  there are some american component fishbowls out there mostly jvc or toshiba colorstream  i think there was one xbr curved set that had component
  i am  and  it works great i am no crt perfectionist and i use composite but nonetheless it looks great the only downside is that its very heavy plan on finding a decently fit neighbor and get something like these pic related i bought them from lowes for 40 they make the job so much easier what i like about the set is that it has component and only excepts 240p and 480i so 240p is properly displayed i would highly recommend this set anon you should go for it if its for a good price i can tell you more about it or take more pictures of it if you want
  there was some sony sets that had actual rgb over a floppy connector
  i got those both sets heres the 20 incher and you can see the 25 incher in the background sitting on its stand with footpedal buttons
  i did it to a sharp brand works well if you can solder and are decent at electronics and reading schematics i like it rgb looks pretty good with a shadow mask     if youre wanting similar results and cant do electronics you can get a retrotek rgb to component converter    of course only some consoles output rgb natively so you might end up doing rgb mods or buying them    having pissed about with almost all types of rgb related things other than upscalers id honestly say those converters are the way to go you only need one and can use any old tv set that has component basically those rgb mods are for people who like to tinker and work on old electronics they are great if your tv only has composite and is one that can be modded though
  cool could you share a pic of the connector and maybe a pic of them running something
  i dont have access to it rn but ive got some old pics heres my custom floppy after i got tired trying to solder higher guage wire to floppy pins i just used a ribbon cable works like a charm
  these are on the 25xbr
  wow thats bizarre thanks thats definitely an unusual monitor youve got there        these look great by the way
  both sets  theres more than just 2 9 or 10 actually a few are admittedly quite similar though
  using a 34 pin connector for rgb was actually fairly commonplace on sony sets of the early to mid 80s i have two myself the 20 and 27 profeel monitors    
  both xbr sets i should say
how hard would it be to turn mono pvm in to a stereo one    it has plugs for left and right channels would it be possible to open it from the inside and splice two new speakers to the left and right channels and mount them on the side or something
  i know it has 750 lines of resolution and my current apex crt tv has less and the top right corner has a green tint and flickers    i dont mind paying a couple 100 for something that works good and will last
  just buying a separate pair of speakers at goodwill would produce far better results and cost substantially less  
  i really hope you did not pay a couple hundred for a monitor that doesnt support rgb
  i did the only consoles i really like to play are genesis and saturn and i only have svideo cables for both    monitors with component or scart costs 5002000
  thats bullshit stay away from crazy sony memes and you can get rgb capability much cheaper than that    also component on a consumer tv will easily beat svideo on that security monitor
  it has plugs for left and right channels  what model chances are thats not left and right but in an out
  you did fine dont let these internet autists get to you shipping a crt is expensive no matter what  might want to get a switchbox though
  you are correct i wouldnt really use it anyways i route the sound from my model 1 sega cd to my pcs line in and use my computer speakers
i see a commodore 1081 monitor with scart for cheap should i go fot it /crt/  i hear theyre only mono audio but i have an audio breakout for my scart cables so that shouldnt be an issue    i see people raving about the 1084s but hows the 1081
  what tube looks great
  absolutely i have a 1080 and the tube is absolutely gorgeous really good looking composite and crispy rgb with light scanlines for a great image svid is great but requires an adapter    pic related i can show you some close ups if youd like
i modded my wii with a wii dual and i have it hooked up via component to a 750 line monitor this is the best pic i managed to get of it so far but stuff looks really damn sharp on it
  finally feeling confident enough to attempt building some but you can find some absolute monsters for fucking nothing with a little patience at worst you may have to recap the crossover network or replace an individual driver but its still a fraction of the cost of buying new basic fucking twoway bookshelf speakers
  jvc
  panasonic but it was one of the ones thats apparently a rebranded jvc a bth1390yn
just picked up a sony kv20fs12 locally only to find its composite only whats everything i need in order to rgb mod this sucker i already have a soldering station coming in was a full guide ever posted anywhere its the exact same model as in this video  
ive got a desoldering gun a solder station electrical gloves a way to discharge the tubebut im stuck on capacitors     is there a guide on how to build a capacitor list for a crt what site is the best to use whats the best brand of cap etc im on mouser  theres like 18 drop down menus for a single cap i feel like such a brainlet trying to understand all these terms
  go to the shmups rgb modding thread
  ypbpr was far more common than people think in the 90s
      just stop idiot you are being a retard and filling the thread with retardation you are wrong and always will be      agreed
  you find the list of caps for your shit or you look at them yourself and you buy replacements of the same rating or as close as you can get the cap plague of the early 00s is long gone just do some basic reading
  for the list see the service manual for brands whatever mouser digikey etc carries is gonna be fine
    so i found the service manual for the kv20fs12 though honestly just looking at each cap manually will probably be easier  it lists caps     can someone here retard proof my mouser process for me ive never ordered capacitors for anything so this is going to be a first for me would just entering in what ive entered  choosing any cap this way work can i build an entire cap list this way heres the three caps it gives me when i used those criteria though i had no idea what the difference is between them there werent any 16v caps available so i just chose a 50v one instead which i think is fine right caps explode when they go over voltage not under so more is better i would assume
  forgot the link heres the three caps it gives for that search i chose these since theyre red so i can color code which ones ive replaced all my stock caps are black some people tell me any cap brand is fine  others say chinese caps are bs but i dont know who to believe theres no telling how long theyll keep producing caps either if 2000 or so is all they have in stock kind of scares me for the future of crt repair to be honest     
dropping by this thread to get a consultation from the expert whats the crt market like right now for a guy like me who can pretty much be happy playing in good quality svideo do you think the market will take a nosedive in the next couple of years    also im in the same boat as  never soldered or done a cap replacement before my set needs it and im terribly afraid im going to fuck something up
  theres no telling how long theyll keep producing caps either if 2000 or so is all they have in stock  lmao capacitors of all sizes and specifications will be needed in large quantities from now until the death of the consumer electronics market even a precursory understanding of electronics should tell you this
  theres no telling how long theyll keep producing caps either if 2000 or so is all they have in stock  someone as retarded as you should not be messing with electronic repairs at all
  you watched the savonpat interview eh i did too he knows a fair bit but he doesnt know everything    using higher voltage caps is fine save that they might be bigger though for 47uf it isnt going to increase the size at all the only technical reason not to use higher voltage might be increased esr but the esr of new caps is lower than it ever has been and you can get superlow audiograde electrolytics with just about no esr at all if you need to
  id just wait for something better people usually give away trinitrons in my area
  this 1000x
  slowly creeping up but youll still come across crt tvs and monitors all over the place either being thrown out or sold sub 10 dollars the only higher price items would be pvms and pre2000s computery stuff
  reset your manufacturer and product filter there drag select voltage column from 16 all the way to whatevers highest then sort by price power supply section you might care about low esr or particular size but for most of the rest of the set whatever goes
  mitsubishi cs1973r from 1984 its rf only but has two rf inputs
    to make rf the best it can be i use a short as possible high quality rca cable w/ f type to rca adapter i have great results using 3 foot acoustic research cables i also loop the console power cable through a ferrite bead to help minimize interference w/ the rf signal
  maybe the ferrite bead doesnt help w/ rf interference but just cleans up the dc to the console dont know but for rf out it seems to help
  i have a 29 sony trinitron wega it must be close to 150 lbs i was able to lift it on my own but it was heavy as fuck for a 39 set damn man hope youre a big guy and have 2 strong friends who can give you a hand
  ive got a 36 wega it weighs 220lbs on the nose and can be carried easily by myself and another able bodied adult im a fucking manlet 160lbs as well only issue i have with carrying it is that the bottom of the frame is kind of sharp plastic and will practically cut your skin with the sheer weight if youre not wearing gloves    basically what im saying is quite being a little bitch its not that bad
  what happened in 2012
  it was bad real bad
  genesis  svideo  lmaoing at your life right now do you even dithering son
  nice
  monitors  no they dont you can get a 1921 inch 1600x1200 for 200 easy and with little effort have it displaying your shit    as for pvmemez which i think you are incorrectly calling a monitor you could easily get a 1420 inch for 200350 if you look hard enough and you are not trying for mint
  which i think you are incorrectly calling a monitor  professional video monitor  whats the problem here
  whats the problem here  that you didnt call them preview video monitors
  do you have a single fact to back that up
  such a pleasant shot anon great photo
  thanks for replying i forgot about my promise to post pictures until i saw your post
  hawt what game
  street fighter 3 third strike
do crts have some sort of focus pot inside them or am i out of luck
so the black curved trinitron crts that look like this are a dime a dozen in my area and i think im gonna pick up one of these instead of raping my wallet for a pvm   while im all fine with just using svideo i know theres a version of these that has component as well but ive never seen it and i have no interest in the flat screen wegas i heard you can mod these to support rgb is it worth doing so or will i be just fine with svideo is it as liferisking as people say it is if you do it by yourself if i dont know a whole lot about crts is it even worth trying
  just get a pc crt  inb4 muh real hardware consoles
  yes right on the flyback or a box connected to it sometimes two even for vertical and horizontal that usually is only on pc crts and some large presentation monitors though      svideo is nice if you can find someone to do an rgb mod for you and you want to be a little bit more anal about video quality then maybe you should look into said mod otherwise just stick with svideo it gets you the biggest pq increase for the least amount of hassle
  the reason i ask is because subtitles or text always seems slightly too fuzzy i am also watching a dvd playing though component video so idk if its just an artifact of the resolution or if i can actually fix it
  not that anon but i need to find some way to adjust the focus out from the centre on my bo what are the focus pots usually labelled if there arent any pots how would you go about adjusting focus dont tell me the only option is magnets on the neck
  the only fighting game youll ever need once youve played it    wow how did you capture that moment on camera
   that anon but i need to find some way to adjust the focus out from the centre on my bo what are the focus pots usually labelle  my sharp has two knobs on the flyback one is brightness/level and the other is focus
no svideo mods for nes is there im a burger who would rather not get into the gymnastics of rgb modding but i hate composites dot crawl and washed out color
  if theyre baked in subtitles could just be poorly mastered    what crt if it has a sharpness setting you could try clicking it up one or two ticks      what are the focus pots usually labelled  focus    in most cases youll see a g2 or screen pot and a focus pot on the flyback      lots n lots n lots of photos
  the only way i know is nesrgb which also does svideo
  emulation
you gotta try harder with the threads next time rocky
  its a philips 27 from 2004 oddly enough when using the component video input theres no setting for sharpness it only works on svideo and composite modes
are phillips magnavox crts shit or not shit i found a 27ms3404 on the cheap its a 480i curved set with svideo and component which is everything i want
  pc crt  that sounds intriguing i guess youre talking about emulation how do games that switch between 240p and 480i work
  im eager to emulate tv crts and pc crts when proper 4k oled 144hz come out  the possibilities for simulating the display matrix and strobe would turn them into the true crt successors
  oleds have native resolution so itll never properly replace crts
  and crts had a fixed native display matrix  once the pixel get small enough that becomes a non problem
  fixed native display matrix  that is only a problem for high resolutions which youre unlikely to use on a crt oleds problem is with low resolutions
switches between 240p and 480i    psh nothing personnel lcd
  which is why i said simulating the display matrix through shaders or hardware crtlike interpolation unlikely
  the only fighting game youll ever need once youve played it
  t shit i found a 27ms3404 on the cheap its  nothing wrong with them ive only seen one and it looked good
are there any ntsc consoles which support component but not rgb the gamecube immediately comes to mind but i was wondering if there were others
  wii and wii u
  wii    its the nintendogimpstheirvideooutput thing theyve being doing since day one
    wii is just a software block the console itself is still perfectly capable of rgb output where as the gc is not    i believe the wii u is the same but i could be wrong
  where as the gc is not  so a wii modded for rgb technically has better gamecube output than a gamecube through component cables
  at 480i and 240p possibly but you wont be getting 480p over scart
    i have an ntsc rgb tv that isnt a pvm takes rgb via rs232
  if you live in the us nothing has rgb but professional editing monitors like the pcm/bvm monitors if you like in europe look for a scart rgb port the third option would be to have someone rgb mod a consumer crt nobody offers that as a service though
  some sony xbr has a floppy like connector for rgb
  component is rgb
  you can get 480p over scart if you use a wii modded with a wii dual
  scart is incapable of carrying 480p     yes though in pal regions where the gamecube has native rgb it has a slightly cleaner output than the wii
  yes it can stuff like the ps2 can do 480p over scart using rgsb
  just stop idiot you are being a retard and filling the thread with retardation you are wrong and always will be  keep telling yourself that each night as your cry yourself to sleep the truth remains however and you can offer no justification for your delusion in the face of historical evidence to the contrary
  component is rgb  its not im not saying one is better or worse rgb might have slightly better colors but component can do up to 1080i they are also a slightly different color space
  component can do up to 1080i  the potential resolution and refresh rate of a display have absolutely nothing to do with whether its input is component or rgb what are you on about there are plenty of crt pc monitors that support 1080i and even 1080p or higher that only accept rgbhvvga as input
  also a few nonxbr sets      scart is a connector you could use scart for ethernet if you felt like it but theres nothing out there equipped with a scart connector which will accept rgsb      but component can do up to 1080i  component can do whatever resolution you want theres nothing technically preventing something stupid like a 4k ypbpr signal being sent aside from nothing supporting it on either end 1080p component is supported out right by both the ps3 and wii u
    anyone im really curious about this
how big of a difference does peaking frequency make
dear /crt/  thank you
  looks a bit out of convergence you dont mind
itt the moment good franchises started to die
this fucking game i remember one of the final levels where all you did was grind rails and jump from rail to rail one mistake and youd fall into a bottomless pit the knuckles and rouge levels were also boring af
adventure 1 was no better and in fact in many ways it was much worse at least 2 cut down on the amount of bullshit shoehorned into the game for the purpose of padding the estimated play time of the game
at least adventure 2 had the chao garden and the multiplayer on battle
  i disagree adventure 1 kept its alternate gameplay types pretty short so the novelty didnt wear off while the core running gameplay was pretty well represented with sonic and tails    adventure 2s campaign is a fucking slog the althernate play styles like knuckles stages and teh gunning segments are much much longer than in adventure 1 and there is more of them also added is an annoying buzzing sound when youre doing the gunning stuff which is frankly ridiculous
  but froggy
  adventure 1 has big the cat  adventure 2 does not have big the cat  explain again how 1 is better
  to be fair lttp came after this and is the goat zelda
  big the cat being bad is a game grumps faux retro gamer meme no one gave two shits about the big the cat segments back in the day its perfectly fine
  actually i hate big the cat enough it ruined it for me and ive never watched this show youre talking about
  symphony of the night the final nail in the coffin of truevania
  hate to break it to you but sonic was never good the music is always great though
  i have a pretty good example of that    for me marykate and ashley magical mystery mall in 2000 for the playstation was the downfall of the series everything up until that point was stellar including marykate and ashley get a clue which stands to be one of my favorite games of all time the dressing mechanic ruined magical mystery mall for me instead of shopping for new clothes the game had you trying on different kinds of jewelry that just didnt fit the series since then its all been downhill im sure most other people here would agree
  i never liked big the cat and the first time i played was like 15 years ago he wasnt bad enough to ruin the game but his stages felt really out of place
  this adventure 1 and 2 were a lot of fun  i quit heroes after fucking rail canyon
  rondo got even more popular after that game and the sequels all included a belmont mode of somekind plus adventure rebirth came out so fucking stop whing already
  bigs whole part of the game is like 1520 minutes long unless youre retarded  the shitty parts of 2 are most of the game
  1 had chao garden too and none ever fucking played sonic adventure 2 for the multiplayer  its also ironic that the whole battle thing was supposed to denote the expanded multiplayer aspect yet it actually has less content than the dramcast version
  yeah the igavanias only helped increase the popularity of classivania but manchildren need to desperately create a boogeyman that they can pretend to fight
street fighter 4 3rd strike was the last great sf game after that they got painfully mediocre
  well sure its kind of hard to continue the frame perfect ultra competitve street fighter 3 model when everyone is switching to high latency flatscreens let alone that the primary playtype was switching to online play even the street figther 3 online ports need to account for this with latency callibration which doesnt carry between sets honestly unless everyone adopts high end low latency displays which is unlikely as most modern mid range tvs would rather sacrifice this for price you probably wont see anything close to street fighter 3 again
  zelda 2 aged much more gracefully than the first game
  im only a casual player so i couldnt care less for all the ultra hardcore details i just hate what onos done with the series by getting rid of the bitchin anime aesthetic and making everything dull and ugly as well as making the games feel dull to play with world warrior tier gameplay speed
  id kill for an alpha 4 honestly i love the anime aesthetic of that era as well
  happened before that game op
yes but not because the game itself is bad it was well received well liked despite its flaws the death of the dreamcast due to the fialings of the saturn meant sega had to either shut down or gut their existing studios one by one and even sonic team took the hit its barely recognisable today from what it was like back then sonic will never be great again because sonic team is an unfocused mess sonic mania proves that in spades
  not sure if we played the same game im a huge mgsfag and mgs2 is my favorite game of all time mgs2 shouldve been the last mgs game for multiple reasons but mgs3 is fantastic its the best one gameplay wise and the safer story and characters were a bit of a response for the bad feedback 2 got and unlike 4 and beyond it didnt hurt the canon at all
  sa1 was good though
  dont say things you cant take back
  i actually liked sa2 but then again i was 14 when i played it
  i honestly with all my being want ea to burn in hell
  you mean survive
with the orcarina of time nintendo betrayed what the series had built up on the nes and snes and created one of the dullest entries in a dying franchise seriously each episode following the boy adventurer and his pals from hyrule as they fight assorted villains has been indistinguishable from the others aside from the cartoonish imagery the series only consistency has been its lack of excitement and ineffective use of repetitive puzzles all to make magic unmagical to make action seem inert  perhaps the die was cast when nintendo vetoed the idea of a third party producing the games miyanoto made sure the series would never be mistaken for a work of art that meant anything to anybody just ridiculously profitable crosspromotion for their annual party games and childish fighting franchise the zelda series might be antisony or not but its certainly the antispyro series in its refusal of wonder beauty and excitement    aat least the platforming elements were good though    no     the writing is dreadful the exploration was nonexistent as i played i noticed that every time link went to explore a largely empty world nintendo shoehorned in some repetitive puzzles to pad out the game i began marking on the back of a nintendo power magazine every time i came to the same rehashed box pushing/lever pulling puzzles i stopped only after i had marked the envelope several dozen times i was incredulous nintendos team is so governed by cliches and milking tired franchises ad nauseum that they have no other style of development later i watched a lavish loving lets play of the ocarina of time by some youtube manchild he said something to the effect of if these kids are playing ocarina of time at 11 or 12 then when they get older they will go on to owning a nintendo switch and he was quite right he was not being ironic when you play the ocarina of time you are in fact trained to play the same dull nintendo rehashes decade after decade
yoshis story and smash killed the character forever for me i loved yoshi from the cartoon and the snes
  skyrim killed es    fallout 4 killed fallout    starcraft dead  diablo dead    but nothing worse than chrono cross
  pic unrelated you meant to post sonic heroes
who am i kidding this series was never good to begin with
    cringe
  check out the hot take    engineering marvel to make the n64 even run 3d games  bitch about the game design    this is about series dying not about individual entries not measuring up to the rest
  this belongs in /ogg/
  tech demo  good game  pick one just because something was a leap forward that doesnt mean that it should be judged by different standards
  why would you reply to obvious copypasta
  fuck i thought i remembered seeing that before
  is this icycalm
  that pic is not deleted  jannies confirmed chums with the dungeon keeper
    wooly world was great tho
dont see the point in deleting all the posts of the non retro games in here reminiscing a series golden age in the retro era and pointing out the point it died afterwards seems on topic enough to me otherwise you just have to outright lie for some of these ie pokemon which sure as hell didnt die with gsc
  thanks to based goemon devs
  even though i love yoshis island i love this game too i honestly also dont think its a bad game just short and easy    also this hopefully crafted world will be great too
  never have a problem with the characters changes at all and i was first exposed to him since smw hes always been the same to me just more cute and like everyone else in the mario series with an actual voice
  yoshi voice made sense in story when they were supposed to be babies but using the baby voice for grown ass yoshi makes him gay
  shadow the hedgehog game was the start for me that the series was going downhill and for turning shadow into what he is today shadow was a great character who actually has some personality in sa2 while his game turned him into edgy tryhard that people sees him to this day      i actually like yoshis story its better than most other yoshi games besides woolly world old yoshi is better but the current isnt really that bad
  but using the baby voice for grown ass yoshi makes him gay  i seriously dont see how though even back then before his changes he always comes off as a childish/cutesy/kidappeal character hell the cartoon has even portrayed him a child anyways his current voice isnt even out of place for him for both classic and current plus it wouldnt make sense how a baby yoshi can actually make more sounds than a adult one anyways
  you mean shadow
  star fox adventures
  theeee assssshooooooooooole
  im pretty sure they were saying the endo or something similar to that in japanese according to some people
  i be lying if i didnt say love this games soundtrack       i hope to god that crafted world still get good music despite the original composer has left
    looks like yoshi been calling you an asshole this whole time
other m and donkey kong jungle beat
  nobody says 06  everyone says sa1/sa2 has ruined the series  whats wrong with you fags
  kills dungeon keeper and mythic entertainment in one fell swoop  tthanks ea
  uh i dont know maybe its not retro you idiot
  doesnt change the fact that you retards really think any of these games ruined this franchise have fun with your shit taste
  maybe but i still had fun with this game glad woolly world took some inspiration of this game in visual design
  read the op you mongoloid the thread is about the moment good franchises started to die not when they died
  it was still a step down from lltp and the series never reached the heights of the first three games again
  haha its a different version of some lit professors comments about harry potter
  does that mean the game that began the trend of the series quality drop or the last good game
    youre not wrong
  people were shitting on big the cat ages ago i remember nintendo power and game informer shitting on big the cat when i was a kid
  i cant tell if youre being a revisionist or were actually too young to have been around back then but big was always despised
  this but unironically
  meh its no yoshis island but i like it the game actually have a lot of secrets and actual challenges when youre not trying to collect every single fruit you see just to get to the next level already the soundtrack was great too    i also miss classic yoshi but this image screams soul vs soulless meme bullshit
  1 had chao garden too   it was fucking shit in comparison anon
  retard
shadow the hedgehog was so shit not bad in retrospect
     id take yoshis story over any other yoshi game easily i dont want to play the same platform game for 40 hours      give me a straight forward 810 hour experience that i can come back to every now and again
/v/ doesnt get it    they cant see how shallow the experience really is
  this is probably le ebin trololol but for how much i like the game i actually agree that the combat is pretty shallow in the first spyro game and never really progresses outside of flame or ram this guy depending on how he looks also the bosses are really lame    2 pretty much fixes both of these things though so whatever
  well heres hoping i got to the third world and im tempted to just drop it and move onto ripto
  third world is kinda my favorite so theres that the levels do a lot of interesting stuff with ramps and the enemies get at least a bit more complex
  spyro isnt a game its an experience      the sequels are terrible
  2 is fantastic 3 i wont defend too gimmicky for my tastes its like on some level even the developers were getting bored of their own games
  spyro isnt a game its an experience    yeah a shallow one hence my op
    cringe
  the sequels get progressively more tedious with having to backtrack after unlocking abilities and characters so i understand if people have gripes with those but if you talk shit about the first one ill break your fucking legs
  tfw a welltraveled adult who has had the privilege of playing a timeless classic without the slant of nostalgia
all the unique areas in spyro 1  the hub worlds in spyro 2 that evoke a certain emotion  something about spyro 1 and a bit of 2 evoke the artist within the player when they explore the deserted worlds they truly feel like an adventurer and i think thats what makes spyro 1 stand out i think it really goes inhand with the 90s design of giving the player intrigue and presenting them unique and aweinspiring worlds spyros mystique disappears by the 2nd game but the hubs are a work of art i think theres something oddly artistic and charming about these sections but that sounds a bit snobby so ill leave it at it really feels like whoever made these sections really wanted them to feel alive and put care into them its that effort that gives me a small amount of acknowledgement of the first two games
spyro is relaxing but the gameplay has always been extremely mindless with minimal thought processes required    i like it but it lacks the sophisticated mechanics of mario 64 or the creativity and atmosphere of banjokazooie though of course it has some atmosphere
  was it spyro 1 or spyro 2 where you play hockey vs the penguin dude that one was ok but yea the game is mostly empty shit recently replayed them both at a friends place before remasters came out
  go back to /v/ spyro is pretty wellliked on /vr/ too
personally i only played 3 i had a great if very easy time until the game decided not to give me the last dragon egg for 100 completion  then i found out there was more stuff after finding all 150 eggs
  im not knocking the sequels i cant speak on those but the first game is lackluster designwise
  theres nothing wrong with a game being shallow
  yup the game is shit compared to spyro 2  231      sequels are terrible  the first game plays like an alpha version of s2      the only thing wrong with s2 is backtracking if youre so bothered with it you can just cheat to get all powerups problem solved
  i like the simplicity
  this is shallow in the same way that kirby is shallow easy gameplay its still a fun game and the visuals were revolutionary back in the day    i recently got the remastered version its pretty great so far but i prefer the original graphics thankfully there is retro control mode
  yeah i agree with you i burned a copy and tried it out on my psx for about an hour and it never really got good i can appreciate the graphics the music and the atmosphere but it wasnt very fun    t 18 year old zoomer with no nostalgia
   231  based although the backtracking on s2 never gave me a problem it was actually justified and imho not a chore
  wasnt a problem for me either but i can see how it would make for a much better playing experience if there wasnt any rearranging levels and/or slightly altering them would do the trick  the best example is level 1 which needs climb you only get the ability to climb once you beat the first boss and get to the 2nd hub world this means you have to spend 34 minutes going back to the first level which you probably completed 90 just to get that one orb and 40 or so gems this could easily have been fixed by just making a secret breakable wooden barricade behind the first squirrel you shoot which then lets you access a tunnel to get to the position of the mission giver with the alternative route being stairs for people who miss the barricade
    all games are fucking mindless
  even chess
  well seeing as its analogous to the race wars thanks to skewed win percentages yes id say so
  being well traveled is a meme especially in the age of the internet
  its like on some level even the developers were getting bored of their own games    thats exactly why they happily walked off and let universal get a new developer while they went on to ratchet and clank
  rearranging levels and/or slightly altering them would do the trick  no absolutely not what makes you think it could be better that way  the best example is level 1 which needs climb you only get the ability to climb once you beat the first boss and get to the 2nd hub world this means you have to spend 34 minutes going back to the first level which you probably completed 90 just to get that one orb and 40 or so gems  i know yours was just an example but  he didnt use the superfly upgrade at the end of the level and use it to cheat your way through said high ground  its a really fun anecdote that doesnt require any glitch whatsoever and as such i used it because the developers didnt think about it the game understands what youre trying to do so the countdown of the upgrade goes down way faster but if youre quick enough you can still manage to go there without having the ability to climb i always did that when i was a kid good times
  cheating counts  no  absolutely not  stop being a nostalgiafag
  cheating counts  reading comprehension/10 its not cheating if im not using any code exploiting any glitch or bug etc and even if you could be remotely right about this its not like ive used the airswimming trick or something that truly breaks the game theres way worse than something as innocent as what i did  stop being a nostalgiafag  rearranging levels and/or slightly altering them would do the trick  ikr spyro would be way better with procedurally generated levels which changes everytime you visit them dungeon crawler style please dont make me laugh leave this game alone if you dont know whatre you talking about if you feel like giving some recommendation towards the game mechanics then consider giving actual advices and not some poorly though bullshit son of the new trends
  its not cheating  alright nonintended doesnt count  procedurally generated levels which changes everytime you visit them dungeon crawler style  the fuck are you talking about did you hit your head where the fuck did i ever mention adding new mechanics do you even understand english i said the levels could have been made differently like the first level not having the ladder and instead having a second or a different way to get to the gem cutter or being rearranged like the shady oasis being placed in 3rd world since thats where you get the headbutt and instead move any level which doesnt need it from 3rd world into the 2nd one this makes perfect sense and if you think otherwise youre a retarded nostalgiafag
if the boss battles werent so shit this would be the spyro by far but 2 takes the cake
i dont get it a whale
a hind d
  thanks for the spoilers dickface
  so link only gets to go home by   killing everyone and destroying everything in the dreamworld  nice  what an asshole
  dreamworld what
  if you havent played it by now you deserve spoilers you fucking zoomer
  zelda is garbage anyway no big loss
  do you mourn everytime you wake up
  so why are you getting all bent out of shape over spoilers then dickface
  no its just your mom
  what the hyell    is this a video geem    or a pacific oshin
  this game really fucks me up whats with marin and the other inhabitants in the island are they actual living beings or just solid projections of the wildly active imagination of the windfish subconscious whats with marin turning into a seagull at the end did she become a living being out of the dream is it a good fate bing turned into an animal and knowing that not only your father isnt alive anymore but he wasnt real like you to begin with
  the best game ever made and im not even saying this out of nostalgia i played this game for the first time this year with the 3ds virtual console
  fuck off 4channel has a spoiler function for pics and text learn to use it dickface
  im not even that guy dickface just a different guy calling you out for your oversalty belligerence in a thread about a game series you claim to not even like    now fuck off
  its turtles all the way down anon
    tfw no qt dream island girl waifu
  whales arent fish dumbo
  the wind fish in name only for it is neither
  the wind fish in name only for it is neither
    the wind fish is the point of full out this is a dream and that you have to wake up
    my nigga
  jesus christ you are a dipshit
  you dont
the wind fish in name only  for it is neither
  shes a tulpa  a tulpa created by a god and thus able to be granted physical form      the dream ends but the windfish is still alive so everyone on the island is still alive they just dont have a physical form  when a play ends the characters turn back into actors this is just a more extreme version of that
why does everyone keep saying its a dream
  when a play ends the characters turn back into actors this is just a more extreme version of that  deep
  unironically using the term 4channel
i wonder if the wind fish is related to jabu jabu and the zoras  and if somehow marin and tarin are dreamy reincarnations of malon and talon
how would you guys compare links awakening to the oracle games  i played awakening as a kid but never beat it and its still harder for me to get into these days that either oracle game
  man go beat the game right now  you got stuck in eagle tower
  its around 20 years old bitch boy
    im still  in a dream  snake eaaaterrr    
  you would only know that this is a spoiler if you already knew it was how could you know it is the end otherwise
  projecting  im not the first guy too ive already played la and liked it still i have to call you out for justifying spoiling dickface  fuck off arrogant kid    cant you read the urlbar or are you still in denial
  no idea it was when i was in elementary school and im almost 30 now
  dude go play it right now from the beginning emulate it or whatever its very well designed if youre used to play zelda games you wont have any kind of problem only infamous dungeon has a puzzle where you have to throw a giant iron ball through holes to the bottom floors to destroy some pillars and make the tower fall down but thats at the end of the game almost
  why do you care about other people  you are enabling wickedness and evil spoiler images should be spoilered think of your fellow man obviously not everyone has played the same games
  the only people spoiling anything are the people who are calling out that its a spoiler and explaining to everyone exactly what the image is and where its from
sea bears foam   sleep bears dreams   both end in the same way   crasssh
  whining about spoilers in a very well known retro zelda game  that literally gives it away in the title   the only crying manbaby here is you dickface get over yourself
    ywn save her  just fuck me up senpai
does any zelda game handle exploration as well as this game
  this was another of these owl stones rights  those were chilling in many ways
  music  the fish stirs in the egg   you are there
  you can choose to stay in the island if you want but the lands are still covered in nightmare monsters and marin wont give you attention after the date at the bay because shell be frantically singing nonstop  thats just how it is
  
  in school i learned that peace is an unnatural state for humanity    dropped for misanthropic fatalism thanks for the sneak peak into how fallacious kojima philosophy is
  click the home button at the bottom of the page  take a screenshot  report back with the screenshot and then shut the fuck up about 4channel forever
  its a reference to the influence of an important immanuel kant essay not an artists statement you fucking cretin
  its 25 years old
    they cant beat links awakening without dying  git gud niggas
  projections
  you mean by gating everything off so that you have to complete the dungeons in order    i love la to death for its narrative but after playing zelda 1 i had to realize that it started the series decline into explorationless linear mediocrity
  it started the series decline into explorationless linear mediocrity   what the fuck la came after alttp and was way more open than it it has the perfect amount of freedom more linear than zelda 1 so you dont have to use a shitty map included in the manual bomb every single wall you see etc while still being less linear than alttp so you still have to explore
  she looks like she has downs
  yeah thats kinda what the official art looks like too
  links awakening didnt really have amazing official art it dials up the classic kids anime look a bit too high
does anyone else prefer the original title screen the shadow was cool and i feel like the clouds take away from the starkness of the giant egg on top of a mountain
  pseud detected
okay so everything is the wind fishs dream except link   or does he die too if the fish wakes up   and if not what the fuck is he doing there   how did he end up in a whales dream
  dont think about it too hard or you might wake up too
  its a shared dream he fell unconscious in the shipwreck  let us awaken together  then he wakes up in the flotsam and sees the wind fish flying away
  have to say when i was playing the game as a kid i did not expect the wind fish to wind up looking like that
  well im convinced you didnt understand the reference despite attacking its fallacious philosophy yet its the guy who called out your retardity whos the pseudointellectual
    why does the windfish look as if it has taken the greatest hit from the largest bong ever
  let me tell you something about existential philosophy
    ok so what you are saying is if i take the whole sheet of lsd i can essencially achive the same results and live in the dreams i am having
  no but if you take a whole page of lsd youll understand how your universe is merely another story     unironically
    another story    imagine    i thank you anon great weekend to you
  of course but once you being pink spots to the table hard shadows are out    gameboy graphics can look incredible sometimes because of how artists used texture to make up for color just look at river king
best video game story ever only game to make me actually cry
  i remember reading about river king in a nintendo power back in the day and it sounded really comfy i wish i had gotten the opportunity to play it as a kid
  i used to draw this games art on my chalkboard i wasnt a big artist and never really drew much else this games story and adventure were just so important to me
  nigger what are you doing
lit af zelda boss coming through
  so this is the enemys new biowe𝒶pon
  
i wish avgn would review this so he could say a fucking whale
    not who you were talking to but yes
      when a play ends the characters turn back into actors this is just a more extreme version of that    this is actually extremely woke may quote you on this
    i really want this guy to come back just for the fucking bloodbath
  you may have that impression because the world being smaller than in alttp forces you to cross portions of the map already discovered but it is a good exploration game in name only
    was terranigma inspired by la
  what the fuck la came after alttp and was way more open than it  how so    you can actually do several dungeons out of order in alttp the dark world section of the game is actually way less linear than most zelda games
  only crying manbaby here is you  said the one salty for being called dickface and being so new to think everyone is the same person on an anonymous board  fuck off dickface    still redirect me to 4channelorg since when refering to a website by the url is wrong  do you even know how the web works or are you acting retarded on purpose
  you dont have to do the dungeons in order the flippers are easily accessible in their respective dungeon and that allows you to enter catfishes maw early its also possible to enter turtle rock without the mirror shield provided youre quick enough  and if you collect the seashells and get the upgraded sword early enough you skip the ghost entirely
    most modern aaa games like skyrim have a huge map and let you do stuff out of order they still feel extremely linear because you are always told where your objectives are and just go walking straight to those places alttp is like that and it has to be since the map is too big for the game to expect you to explore everything without giving you directions  la is different the dungeons keys to the dungeons trading sequences etc were all scattered throughout the map the map wasnt too big so you were expected to explore every single inch of it and after getting a new item you could go across new paths in all parts of the map so it felt like it was a new map altogether and you had to explore everything again  you cant beat la without exploring every single inch of the map and thats what made exploration so special in that game it also has the most fun items in the series some of the best dungeons and puzzles in the series one of the best soundtracks in the series and the best story and setting in the series hands down i honestly think its the best zelda game both from the gameplay and from the story standpoints and i didnt even play this game as a kid i have no nostalgia for it at all
  honestly i prefer everything about the originals graphics and palette dx was a mistake
  fish thank you very much
  yeah i also prefer it its more mysterious and ominous    ive talked about this before but yeah i also prefer the original colors on dx clash a bit too much with each other original monochrome is more seamless  i wouldnt say dx was a mistake and i can see how some people might prefer it in color but i think the game was developed as a monochrome game artistically and it shows
  not it wasnt and im glad it is possible to play the game with colors
  the flippers are easily accessible in their respective dungeon and that allows you to enter catfishes maw early    if you have to enter a dungeon to grab a progression item before just abandoning it to go beat another dungeon that doesnt really count yes you technically completed the dungeons out of order but youre required to enter the dungeons in order and to acquire the progression items in order all youre really doing is halfcompleting dungeons and then adding a ton of backtracking to the game for no good reason
  it would count if la were a roguelite though
  la is better but the oracle games are fun and have replayability if you like collecting junk to rpg up link    the original la not dx also has the screen warping glitch with the select button this is a really cool trick to play around with and skip around the game in a nonlinear fashion
  the bottle grotto 2nd dungeon has a pretty tricky puzzle if you dont know the enemies names have to kill three in a certain order to get the boss key
  the original la has a warping glitch using the select button which you can use to make the game completely nonlinear its not playing as intended but its there and easily accessible
  la shits on crapcom zelda i think less of people who like the oracle games as more than an amusing novelty
  the dungeons are better in oracles and you can even do a couple out of order in seasons but they cant compete with las feels
  i dont understand the obsession with doing things out of order i think you guys are just followers by nature and easily influenced by marketers    it doesnt make it suddenly more fun going out of order you still play the levels gaming magazines and review sites have poisoned your mind
    ive never understood this i get that for multiple playthroughs you might wanna try things in a different order but this obsession with doing things out of order is weird as fuck
  its because pacing and difficulty curve dont matter to the majority of gamers theyre all savestating anyway
  the easy ability to do dungeons out of order makes the game fell messy and results in a bad difficulty curve as you progress see albw     its okay when the progression can split into a choice between two dungeons at certain times for example the oot spirit and shadow temple
  the goron dance in ooa was enough for me to shit on the game although i enjoyed the dungeons in that game because i prefer difficult puzzles in zelda games    mc on the other hand is oversimplified zoomer trash
    i never really thought about that maybe that is the reason
  i think you guys are mindless followers for not wanting to only go where the games tells you  great logic there buddy
    mc was good everyone who says otherwise is dumb i played links awakening as a kid on a road trip and i only recently played mc but i was super impressed by it i think mc is one of the better zelda titles
  its objectively a bad zelda game  short as fuck  easy as fuck  kinestones  shrinking gimmick
    mc isnt the best game in the series but its not even close to the worst and by any standard its at least as good as the oracle games
   but its not even close to the worst  of couse not phantom hourglass exists  its kind of amazing how inconsistent the handheld zelda games are both the best game in the franchise links awakening and the worst game in the franchise phantom hourglass are handheld titles i guess thats because since the handheld games arent mainline titles there is more freedom to experiment with them so they end up being outliers for better or worse
    being a polite human being you
  lol links awakening as best lol
  if you nodeath it marin flies around as the marin sprite assuming nodeath is canon wtf does that mean
    what would you say the best game in the franchise is
  you forgot where i said you can enter turtle rock without the mirror shield you just have to be quick enough meaning you can skip eagle tower
  its zelda  its garbage  dont think too hard about it
  fair enough but youre gonna have to beat eagle tower anyway to get the instrument so youre just gimping yourself for no reason and taking a weird detour it just doesnt seem very worthwhile what do you really gain by doing those two dungeons out of order
  best characters  best story  best sequences bowwow flying rooster animal village date with marin  best overworld dense and interesting  best girl  best length  rocs feather    yup checks out links awakening is practically flawless edit out the text boxes for guardian acorns pieces of power and stones and its actually flawless
  if his favourite game zelda game is anything outside of alttp la oot or mm then his opinion is automatically invalid
    yeah its kind of weird that anyone would consider la anything other than top 5 material
  still seething that a monochrome game made by a tiny development team on a toaster console still managed to better than your aaa budget zelda game
  including the n64 games but not the nes ones
  hes drowning in an ocean
  for  
  edit out the text boxes for guardian acorns pieces of power and stones and its actually flawless  for gods sake this also the power bracelet should be equipped at all times once you aquire it kinda like the flippers
  i like twilight princess a lot personally
    links awakening is without a doubt top 5 anyone who says different is high
  underrated post holy fuck
  lets not be delusional here
  twilight princess is filled with too many mediocre minigames imo the atmosphere is still top notch and i love midna though
  only the nightmare it was very insistent to stay alive
  the fire rod which gives a quick kill on the boss of eagle tower and yes you have to beat all the dungeons to beat the game that was never in question you just stated you couldnt do dungeons out of order and that is objectively wrong
  okay i accept that you can do exactly one dungeon out of order in links awakening what a marvel of nonlinear design on par with lttp and super metroid
  the power bracelet should be equipped at all times once you aquire it kinda like the flippers    but which button would you use to pick things up
  but which button would you use to pick things up  a and b at the same time _ツ_/ idk you got me there my biggest gripe with la was constantly switching items all the time having the ability to always lift rocks instead of having to equip the power bracelet would have greatly reduced the amount of times i would have had to brought up the item screen
  lttp  read   that game is way more linear than la
  once youre in the dark world you actually have a lot of freedom in how you progress there are key items found on the overworld that you can use to access various dungeons so you can actually go through the dungeons in a surprisingly varied order it just doesnt feel that way because the dungeons are numbered on the map while thats the suggested path through the game its not actually required to follow it unlike la where you have to do everything in sequence with only one exception of switching two dungeons
  you can skip beating any dungeon and get the item and do the whole thing in reverse order if you really want to
  going into a dungeon getting all the way to the item then fucking off to some other dungeon for no reason is not the same as exploring the overworld and doing sidequests and obtaining the items necessary to enter multiple dungeons of your choice
  cant wake up  
ive been ignoring the main story and just grinding jp to make my characters stronger am i playing this game wrong
  also why doesnt spin first ever hit and do the days moving forward actually matter
  i wouldnt say its right or wrong if youre liking going whole hog on leveling right now and unlocking shit thats cool but if you decide to replace members later youll have more work to do      if you mean literally never its probably a bug vanilla fft has a lot of these but otherwise you might have to look at the accuracy formula for the move to see what the problem is    do the days moving forward actually matter  not in terms of the story you cant go forward 10 years and miss out on the war the months matter lorewise in terms of the zodiac remember when you got to pick your birthday you can think of it as a less extreme version of type in pokemon it affects damage and chance to hit but you wont notice it unless youre looking for it capricorn has the cleanest set of advantages/disadvantages tons of bosses are virgos while gemini has the messiest    however the passage of time doesnt affect this you dont get a bonus during your month or a penalty during the opposing months its just a lazy way to convey the passage of time how long did it take ramzas troupe to get from point a to b this many days
  thanks for the info im enjoying gaining new skills and doing the story little by little just wasnt sure if the passage of time would have a negative impact ill just write the spin fist thing as a bug since monks have better abilities anyway
  tons of bosses are virgos  hehe
  the passage of time is reflected in the ages listed in the lion story section if i remember right so you can get silly stuff like the baby theyre trying to put on the throne being 12 years old if you waste enough time
  ive been ignoring the main story and just grinding jp to make my characters stronger am i playing this game wrong  the main downside of doing it this way is that story battles dont scale but monsters do so you can easily outlevel most of the game this isnt a problem apart from reducing the challenge though
  theres at least one scary exception to that the finath river fight is a story fight that uses random chocobos matched to your level which can destroy you if it rolls a bunch of red ones
  you can also destroy the entire game by fielding ramza4 red chocobos
    if youre not doing a math speed run youre doing it wrong
  im not leveling that much just beat velius and it was hard af
  ramza and dellita die at the end
  neither of them die
  yes go straight from one story even to the next my friends thought it was impossible but i tried it and it totally works you just have to be smart and careful you do kind of get fucked over at the beginning of chapter 2 because your npc party members will be higher level than you and therefor all enemies will be their level also summoners fuck summoners    aside from that watch out for pic related
  i would say level between story battles each chapter should have at least a dozen battles dedicated to leveling if i hadnt leveled like i did then i would not have made it to chapter 4 however also kind of fucked my party up and did not realize it until chapter 3 so its taken time to adjust anyway theres nothing wrong with experimenting on different jobs and skills just get ramza to ninja and carry along a few support class characters to make most battles a piece of cake there have only been a few battles that gave me a hard time
  is there a good fantran not a big fan of wotl or the original
my problem with this game was that if you just play it as a traditional rpg you get fucked as early as dorter city    can i just play the game and not have to fuck w/ the job system for an hour before battle
war of the lions is the best version if you dont like the hammy olde english you are objectively wrong
  anything that removes animals have no god  good
during a random battle my opponents were a monster and a knight but the knight was a guest for some reason and he and the monster fought each other anyone else experience something like this
  yeah some areas have unique encounters like this
  can i just play the game and not have to fuck w/ the job system for an hour before battle  you definitely can i mean you do have to decide what abilities you want to purchase with jp and do standard rpg equipment stuff i would say that for the best experience youll at least want to retool every once in awhile to flesh out secondary and support abilities but you can easily beat the game with a party of simple classes like knight monk white mage and black mage
  i tried knight archer white mage and black mage with ramza as the knight didnt get past chapter 3
  did you get bored or did you get stuck on weigraf/velius
  is there a good fantran  no
blade grasp is too op im beginning to not have fun because three of my dudes have it and they all got 97 bravery and low faith too just got orlandu / excalibur and whoever i give that sword to just goes out of control and could solo most encounters maybe next time i play im doing a no samurai challenge because this shit is just stupid
  i didnt want to spoil anything but yeah weigraf im sure its technically possible to beat him as a knight but its hard to imagine
  make it no oriental ninja  monk is broken as fuck too
  yeah ninja is definitely almost as bad im playing this game for the first time in 10 years and just went with what i remembered which wasnt everything now i have three melee characters who just are almost unstoppable and because they all are almost invincible against weapon attacks enemies ignore them and go for my casters who then die almost instantly without getting anything done which is annoying because one of them has holy and some high level wizard spells and the other is a summoner both with halved mp theyre actually the fun characters and i cant really use them maybe ill just stop using blade grasp and go for hamedo instead could be a riot
  i always prioritize hamedo over pretty much everything else ramza as a ninja with martial arts and hamedo is so overpowered its stupid
  nah the story falls apart in chapter 4 when the dull church plot takes over everything
  dull church plot takes over everything  the dull church plot is literally the entire essence of final fantasy tactics its the entire over arching story
  download a mod like 13 or laggy fantasy tactics
  yeah i guess id say you really want to have at least a couple of jobs unlocked for ramza by that point the most commonly suggested method for people who get really stuck there is to abuse yell
  blade grasp is too op  agreed plus its literally broken as im pretty sure its not supposed to work on monsters another op one is mp switch and move mp up but at least that takes 2 ability slots  ive definitely played through where i did not use blade grasp did not use math skill and did not grind eg hitting each other for jp and found it more rewarding
  lol yes the enemies scale to your level
  only random encounters
  i played lft and had a great time tried to just have characters use the innate toolsets per class with ramza as a mediator and the game took a fresh breath of air for me then i got to finath river
  and monster type enemies which appear in a number or story missions
  well technically its configured individually for every unit in every encounter in the whole game with an editor you can go in and change them if you want  nonmonster types in random encounters are levelscaled for example
  count orlandu is op as well i feel like i could just steam roll most missions with him alone id straight up wouldnt use him sometimes to preserve a challenge
  yeah and when the war aspect of it dies off and the church becomes the main focus midtolate chapter 4 it becomes boring
    if youre having fun then youre not doing it wrong
  i hope you find the monk gang early for your sins
should i play patch 13
  13 is dumb    lft is very fun though
for someone who has already enjoyed final fantasy tactics what game should he play next
  whats wrong with 13 have you even played it
  i had a ton of fun with 13 although i didnt play through to the end ive heard the end gets kind of absurd and biased toward a rather boringly narrow range of viable tactics my main gripe for the first half of the game is that charm abilities are way too common and important    the sandbagging and healing dynamics can get annoying too but do open up a lot of interesting scenarios you have to think several turns ahead and can make use of abilities that might have been pointless in vanilla for example ive actually used the monks secret fist in scenarios where i didnt want to waste a turn dealing damage or even koing a character who would just be healed or brought back to life before its next turn equipmentbreaking or stealing abilities become much more important breaking armor is a permanent loss of max hp that cant be healed back breaking a weapon can neutralize damage output battles wind up being longer and more dynamic so taking chances like that can pay off you wind up having to pay more attention to the enemy ai and bait them into doing what you want    the class balance changes are mostly solid the wizard and marksman classes in particular are much more interesting and fun to play than their vanilla equivalents
story missions dont scale so if you grind too much the final battles will be very underwhelming
  tactics ogre
  two things i really hated about the base game were summoners and enemy magic knights how have those changed
  swordskill abilities no longer have 100 hit rate but are still very powerful  the main change to summoners is that they are faster both in terms of getting their turn sooner in vanilla they have a penalty and shorter charge times on spells golem is removed though
  so they made summoners even stronger   im guessing the game has been balanced for that though
  well 13 is shamelessly a difficulty hack though there are versions that tone it down id say if you arent inspired to figure out how to beat summoners in vanilla using the tools already available then 13 is probably not worth playing    general approach to beating summoners in vanilla is to spread out your characters ko them asap and/or use lowfaith characters to reduce their damage output
  only complete incels would grind in a jrpg theres no reason to grind all it does is get rid of any semblance of challenge in an already easy genre
  reddit buzzword  stop playing games the way i dont like
  am i playing this game wrong  no thats pretty much how youre meant to play the game encourages grinding theres a couple of really hard battles that are the 2nd or 3rd in a sequence of story battles where you can get completely fucked over if you havent grinded enough and made the mistake of saving there     fft is definitely a game where youre better off grinding til youre overpowered rather than end up in an unwinnable situation
  but you can play it straight and its not even that hard you have to have foreknowledge of chapter 3 wiegraf but aside from that its entirely doable
  depends on the context for many it was their first srpg and there are definitely fights that require some forethought and planning into what you bring to them off the top of my head other than wiegraf theres the execution site fight with gafgarion and that fight with elmdor where his two whores instantly rush you on the rooftop also that last one is the only place you can get the genji equipment and if you didnt bring a thief youre shit out of luck
  you just have to focus gafgarion once you kill him the fight ends  i dont remember having much trouble with the rooftop fight and you dont need the genji gear    for me there were 3 tests of your ability the first is dorter if you can do dorter without any grinding you can probably finish the game its not too hard after that until chapter 2 especially the hill where ajora was killed thats the first map with summoners and the terrain makes it even harder and theyre all higher level than you since your npcs are third is wiegraf
  i thought you had to clean up other units besides gaf maybe im remembering a mod or just always have to break his stuff and focus the time mages rooftop is actually easy af noobs just dont understand speed stats and ct  rafas ai is silly though wiegraf/execution are only hard if you lock yourself into a single save file dorter can be hard but i think finath or some random encounters are the real trial
  you just have to focus gafgarion once you kill him the fight ends  not him but thats not true he does warp out if you get him to low health but that battle is difficult at lower levels because the enemies start in fairly advantageous positions and there are time mages the battle at the gate can also be tricky although its not as hard as the execution site  i dont remember having much trouble with the rooftop fight   ive never had trouble with that one personally but i do see how it can be problematic its possible for rafa to die before you even get a chance to hit one of the enemies

post the most obscure ps1 game that you know
fuck off you just got this from that shitty mega  again i have thoroughly cleaned the anus of the ps1 with my tongue there is nothing worth playing that you havent heard of
  ybr was on adventure legends a lot before the memeleak but alright
  fuck off you just got this from that shitty mega  which one
the player character was an anthropomorphic wolf with yellow fur and an emo haircut    the title screen made a strong impression on me it had a closeup of the wolf looking forlorn into the distance with an animated tear rolling down his cheek i sketched it from memory    the game had an overhead perspective like legend of zelda and the wolf had a sword and was dressed in a green shirt on the first screen he fought slimes you had a health bar    after this it gets vague i seem to remember that the gameplay changed on every screen i think it was supported in mame since 04    what is this game
is it shocking
thats it thanks anon
oh god ive waited to see someone else do this type of thread with a drawing
r4300i actual 64bit processor  gekko broadway espresso all 32bit    how do nintendo fans justify the leap backwards nintendo took for three generations following the n64
more bits is more better
  you dont need to add more to a comparative in english friend
  you dont need a 64bit processor in a video game system friend
64bit processing turned out only to be necessary to access ram larger than 4gb
  why have cutting edge hardware nintendo realized they could grossly overcharge for lackluster hardware in terms of performance as long as it had some zany hook and/or was at least really cute and appealed to nostalgia even their current gen system is basically just a reskinned less impressive nvidia shield tab for what twice the price and everyone is eating that shit up so the justification is they have mario and all your feels about mario their next system could be a pocket calculator and it would sell theyre making bank on those snes classic emulator systems i already have a superior retropie setup but guess what i still want to buy the damn snes classic they have the konami codes to our hearts man
    lol zinggg
my last console was the cube  when i saw the wii revelation i knew nintendo went to shit   not that the cube was the best thing
  i should think the selling point of the switch is it has physical buttons that attach to the tablet no one else has done that or done it well and it is an obvious as shit idea    back to op why did it take four generations for nintendo to realize they had the correct approach with the n64 and quickly went back to using a 64bit proc
  r4300i has a 64 bit data bus but only 32 bit addressing same as most other contemporary 32 bit computers including pentiums and the powerpc 7xx  gekko/broadway/espresso
  outside of japan and america wii was nintendos first hit console    unless you count handhelds
  tfw gcn and the g3 imacs shared processor architecture
  well you do these days because youd be limited to 4gb ram but yeah you didnt need it in the 90s
   why have cutting edge hardware  nintendo have rarely ever been riding the cutting edge wave see here   but guess what i still want to buy the damn snes classic  sad       64bit is only need for more ram  computer illiterates everyone
  it has been done and well again see nvidia shield you can get buttons docks the whole shebang a bang      i know nintendo doesnt ride the cutting edge that was literally the thesis they dont need advanced hardware they have nostalgia solid sequels to established franchises and sometimes hardware gimmicks that work
  wii was nintendos first hit console  you should look up the famicom or nes some time champ
  yeah its totally the same    pic related is disgusting and i would never play a portable like this
n64 having a 64 bit cpu is merely an accident of history the fact is that when the n64 was being designed the r4300i was the most cost effective cpu on the market and it happened to support internal 64bit processing due to being the lowend model of a processor family designed for workstations    that being said some games did take advantage of its 64bit capabilities glover uses the r4300is 64bit fpu to calculate the ball physics with 64bit fp precision
retards itt dont understand that contemporary cpus arent as cut and dry as its 64bit going by the lcd of bits is retarded because portions of modern cpus have higher bit length components in the buses and the alu going by the hcd is also retarded because defaulting to the highest bit length is stupidly wasteful and often not totally supported by every action available to the microprocessor without huge performance loss this is in addition to the fact that operating systems for decades now give functionality to support virtually infinite bit length when required    the espresso is an infinitely better and more advanced chip than the r4300i and in todays modern world of hardware architecture bit length is wholly fucking irrelevant even memory addressing isnt held back by bit length anymore those 32 bit processors are way more than enough for any developer who isnt a code monkey
  the espresso is an infinitely better and more advanced chip than the r4300i  well no shit one area where the r4300i massively reveals its old age is that it isnt superscalar though it has a genuine 64bit alu the integer and fp alu share resources so it cant use both at the same time which even the pentium 1 can do    its better to think of the r4300i as like a turbocharged risc 64bit intel 486
  blatantly false  you can address more than 4 gigs on even an 8bit cpu it just takes a few extra cycles  the biggest advantage of more bits is the ability to process high precision floats or load more bytes in a single op
  glover had a pc port didnt it wonder if theres any difference in ball psychics
  it probably still does physics calculations with 64bit precision albeit slightly slower on normal 32bit cpus however the typical pc cpu at the time was much faster than the n64 fast enough to brute force it
  as said by   its probably just brute forced on pc by 1998 pc cpus were clocked way higher than the n64s cpu not to mention they were superscalar so they could do fp calculations more cheaply    i imagine the ps1 port would have had compromised physics though not only does that console not have an fp unit but it would lack the resources to brute force it
    1 address bus width does not really matter and has no impact on peformance so its not ana argument 4gb is plenty enough to map all rams flash roms and all needed peripherals in cpu address space for these kind of system    2 r4300 actually had a 32bit data bus      it is considered as a 64bit processor because the execution units is 64bit while gekko and broadway processors had 32bit registers and 32bit execution unit but still 64bit fpu though     thats said it does not really matter considering the latter were running at a way faster clock speed and allowed way faster memory access due to the faster bus clocks speed wider data bus and faster memory in general so they actually were a step forward
    the n64 was a fucking silicon graphics workstation in a little box
  gekko and broadway processors had 32bit registers and 32bit execution unit but still 64bit fpu though   iirc the 64bit fpu inside of gecko isnt actually capable of hardware 64bit precision its just a halfbaked simd implementation that allows for two 32bit fp values to be processed simultaneously
  iirc the 64bit fpu inside of gecko isnt actually capable of hardware 64bit precision its just a halfbaked simd implementation that allows for two 32bit fp values to be processed simultaneously    no fpu uses 64bit floatingpoint registers and supports double precision operations just fine         threestage fpu   fully ieee 7541985compliant fpu for both single and doubleprecision operations   supports paired singleprecision floating point arithematic instruction set extension   supports nonieee mode for timecritical operations   hardware support for denormalized numbers   twoentry reservation station   thirtytwo 64bit fprs for single paired single or doubleprecision operands    you are confusing with the fact gekko has an extended set of instructions compared to offthesell ppc 75x cpus to handle paired singleprecision floating point data format basically one 64bit floating point register is used to hold two 32bit single precision floating point values and fpu can process two singleprecision operations simultaneously for faster performance if doubleprecision is not needed    in addition to single and doubleprecision operands gekko supports a third format called paired single when hid2pse  1   paired single operands are represented in the 64 bit floatingpoint registers as two 32 bit singleprecision floatingpoint values    most of the new instructions for manipulating these operands allow both values to be processed in  parallel in the execution unit    when in paired single mode hid2pse  1 all the doubleprecision instructions are still valid and execute as in nonpaired single mode
  might be but likely not for 32bit reasons the intel fpu utilises 80bit registers so theres 64bit for the ieee standard but also an extra 16 bits of precision for rounding without losing precision early  thats another reason why comparing bits is counter productive there are 64bit cpus with less ability than 32bit cpus even in 32bit mode intel cpus have access to 64bit integer functions 80bit floats 128bit mmx and all manner of simd 64bit through amd64 was largely about fixing the ancient clunky x86 instruction set with something more modern and useful but without the retardation of itanium that and 64bit memory pointers
  you could even patch windows 7 32bit to run more than 4gb of ram the restriction was arbitrary
  fpu uses 64bit floatingpoint registers and supports double precision operations just fine  that doesnt mean it can do doubleprecision in a single pass though for example the motorola 68000 supports 32bit ops and has 32bit registers but cant execute 32bit in a single pass    the gecko documentation is a bit vague about this but i think it actually might be capable of single pass double precision
  in a single pass though    nobody said it could or couldnt it was just an answer to the guy saying gekko fpu couldnt handle 64bit precision     the motorola 68000 supports 32bit ops and has 32bit registers but cant execute 32bit in a single pass    the difference is that the fpu operates with a 64bit data bus while mc68000 alu was only 16bit same as external data bus width
nintendo should have just gone allout and declared their console a 128bit machine like sony and sega tried to do with the dreamcast and ps2    just like the dreamcast and ps2 the n64 has a 128bit vector unit 8 x 16bit for vertex processing and audio synthesis
  r4300i actual 64bit processor    32bit data bus its a 32bit cpu the size of the registers is absolutely irrelevant
  you could run 64gib or ram on 32bit linux all the way back in 1999    the thing is this has no real use in games since each process gets its own 4gib to play with and normal games are singleprocess only    you could get around it but with performance impacts not feasible for video games  run 23 processes  use the painfully slow interprocess communication to tell your slaves which textures to fetch in real time  have them coordinate among each other to make sure only one is talking with the gpu at a time loading in new textures vertices shaders    its an arbitrary restriction but its not simply made up from nothing
  every part of this post is true    nintendo is a greedy arrogant company who thinks that they can survive by pushing out substandard products and survive on nostalgia alone turns out theyre completely right
  id just like to interject for a moment what youre referring to as linux is in fact gnu/linux or as ive recently taken to calling it gnu plus linux linux is not an operating system unto itself but rather another free component of a fully functioning gnu system made useful by the gnu corelibs shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full os as defined by posix    many computer users run a modified version of the gnu system every day without realizing it through a peculiar turn of events the version of gnu which is widely used today is often called linux and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the gnu system developed by the gnu project there really is a linux and these people are using it but it is just a part of the system they use    linux is the kernel the program in the system that allocates the machines resources to the other programs that you run the kernel is an essential part of an operating system but useless by itself it can only function in the context of a complete operating system linux is normally used in combination with the gnu operating system the whole system is basically gnu with linux added or gnu/linux all the socalled linux distributions are really distributions of gnu/linux
  32bit data bus its a 32bit cpu the size of the registers is absolutely irrelevant  except it has a 64bit alu which is arguably the true measure of bitness for a cpu by your logic the snes cpu is only an 8bit processor
    you dont need 64bits for more than 4gb nor do you need 128bit for more than 8/16gb of ram
  not to mention 4gb was a laughably huge amount of ram in the gamecubes heyday still a large amount when the wii was released and perfectly acceptable for a desktop build when the wii u was released
  you dont need 64bits for more than 4gb  you do if you want to bit able to address it all with a single value otherwise youll need to make a bunch of compromises that have significant drawbacks    nor do you need 128bit for more than 8/16gb of ram  huh who claimed that
        again as  said 4gb is for the full cpu address range ie all memorymapped peripherals that are readable or programmable by the main cpu like audio dsps gpu flash rom nonvolatile memory etc not just ram
  the size of the registers is absolutely irrelevant  im struggling to understand how someone could know so little about computers to think this
  thats only on the 32bit pc standard x86 processors themselves dont have any such restrictions  all the bits refer to is the number of registers you have access to but it doesnt impose such a low limit on what you can access on the memory heap
  most people dont call a 68000 a 32bit cpu
  that isnt what people are talking about if you knew your shit that isnt the same internals as the switch like the shield tv is
  razer had a tablet years ago similar specs as a switch to that had removable controller bs
  thats only on the 32bit pc standard x86 processors themselves dont have any such restrictions  how so you can only address 4g distinct addresses with a 32bit value if your bus is less than 32b wide youre going to struggle to pass large memory addresses down it    all the bits refer to is the number of registers you have access to  i though it was the bus width not the register size either way though you really need to be able fit an entire memory address into a word     it doesnt impose such a low limit on what you can access on the memory heap  of course it does
  it would be pretty hard for the 68000 to do 32bit ops if it didnt have 32bit registers though anyway its a different situation because the 68000 only has a 16bit alu while the r4300i has both 64bit registers and a 64bit alu
  actually the 68000 supports a single 512bit operation
  shut up and show me a tegra x1 tablet with physical buttons dweeb
  wintards
  but guess what i still want to buy the damn snes classic they have the konami codes to our hearts man  imagine being this much of a dumb consumerist pig whore slut fuck company cucksuck
  os/2 warp also had 64gb ram in like 1996
  i also found it kinda ironic that after that infamous antiibmspot from back in the day     with the ppc processor the apple machines now were ibmcompatible in a literal sense
  the mips r4300i is backwards compatible with the r3000a used in the ps1    thats also why the psp was so good at playing ps1 games  it had a cpu in the compatible mips 4000 series
  so if the psx and n64 use similar cpus why are psx emulators so good and n64 emulators so shit
  didnt that have something to do with how we still dont understand how the gpu and cpu communicate
    no its more to do with the fact that the ps1 has an extremely simplistic gpu imagine a modern gpu with its pixel pipelines cut down to the absolute minimum for textured 3d and thats pretty much what it is    meanwhile the n64 has a very complicated gpu particularly for its era it has an insanely programmable vertex shader and its pixel pipeline even has some weird and flexible fixed pixel shading capabilities similar to the register combiners of voodoo and tnt but allows for a far wider range of inputs and loopback mechanisms    you might then be thinking well surely the gamecubes pixel pipeline is more complicated and thats been emulated well and the answer is yes the gamecubes pixel pipeline is based on the one in the n64 and is more advanced/complicated but theres one enormous difference the gamecube gpu was designed to maintain parity with pc apis like opengl while the n64s gpu doesnt conform with pc hardware at all because it was designed before any pc standard existed    basically one of the main reasons the n64 gpu is hard to emulate is because it doesnt behave like a pc gpu in pretty much any way for example the way it handles texture coordinates is totally different to pcs which is why n64 emulator jank up the texture mappings causing seams and weirdly stretched textures
    i couldnt i stood away from nintendo from the gamecube to the switch
  n64 emulation focused on hle without enough documentation/hacking to find out the problems with that  and stopped development once enough of the nintendo and rare games where playable which is actually quite a bit into the dev cycle  and since then nobody has done all the groundwork that needs to be done to have a emulator thats accurate generally improvements is basically using existing emulators and doing whatever      and things like this plus poor documentation is the reason why its hard to get far  if you want a n64 emulator you basically need a demoscene hacker who can find out how the hardware works enough to make a working scheme for how to get it running properly
  nintendo realized they could grossly overcharge for lackluster hardware in terms of performance  well to be totally fair the one time nintendo couldve btfo the competition in specs they managed to bottleneck the fuck out of it because they were autistic with cartridges plus the system was basically a flop and got assraped by the much shittier playstation hardware so its no wonder they decided it wasnt worth it to go with cutting edge tech
  i dont think nintendo was dumb enough to go after more bits via mental gymnastics after the jaguar claimed to be like 256 bit
  n64 emulation focused on hle without enough documentation/hacking to find out the problems with that  and stopped development once enough of the nintendo and rare games where playable which is actually quite a bit into the dev cycle  and since then nobody has done all the groundwork that needs to be done to have a emulator thats accurate generally improvements is basically using existing emulators and doing whatever    thats not it and doesnt make sense why would they stop development once some games were playable the n64 emulation scene would scramble over themselves for any little improvement in emulation not doing the groundwork wtf are you on about nintendos own emulation of the n64 isnt much better that other guy the next post above yours he knows what hes talking about
  i dont two fucking consoles both based on the gamecube the wii performed like two gamecubes ducttaped together and the wiiu was one or two more their current console or hybrid is your moms android tablet while microsoft and sony are releasing stripped down gaming pcs actually you know what none of the shit thats out today impresses me
  most of the time the n64 is using 32bit ops anyway
  no but you are not arguing for it  n64 emulation is still about the 1990s release of project 64 which means progress or development has not been made while muppen64 is roughly at the same place where nobody is shilling for any major breaktrough in lle    why would they stop development once some games were playable  because zelda pokemon mario smash bros and donkey kong/conker is the significant part of the library     despite wrestle heaven shadows of the empire and turok being major titles with a lot of influence or the fact japan has a entire library of games that isnt exported  and despite the fact a lot of the library has a lot of good fighting games
  what are you talking about man shut the fuck up im tired of people making up shit as they see fit and then trying to soften their original statements after getting called out on it your original post was misinformed and with no bearing on reality just stop stop if you feel a deathly desire to lecture to people go learn some stuff and then you can do it
  exactly right    n64 emulation is still about the 1990s release of project 64   look mom im making shit up on 4chins i am teh funny
  consoles are literally obsolete the switch is nice because it is a dedicating portable gaming platform not a disposable mobile device like a phone other consoles are just crap pcs    /vr/ consoles are awesome because they were special and could do things in hardware that you needed extremely expensive pcs to bruteforce poorly at the end
  and again with no arguments  you are claiming that bizhawk is a feature complete n64 emulator because its sure missing a lot of games  muppen64 isnt a feature complete emulator and really dont advance at all  i doubt any of the early 2000s hle emulators have seen advancement in a decade either

the system has a fuckton of them which ones are you favs  mines are diddy kong racing star wars ep1 racer top gear rally and f1 world grand prix
  was that controller real ive never seen it before
  diddy kong racing is indeed fantastic imho better than mk64  i like ep1 racer but the framerate fucking blows especially in hirez mode with the expansion pak lol i got a copy for the dreamcast and 60fps makes the game so much better  top gear is good    my personal favorite is probably fzero x or extremeg i played the cruisin games a lot in the arcades but idk if the n64 ports were good never owned them also shoutout to waverace 64
top gear rally blew my mind as a kid because of the createalivery had decent physics too one track me and a friend would go offroad just to hit rocks and ramps
  episode 1 racer on dc runs at 30fps tho
    san francisco rush  rush 2 extreme racing usa  rush 2049  beetle adventure racing  diddy kong racing  top gear overdrive  top gear rally  star wars episode 1 racer  f zero x  crusin exotica  california speed
the cruisn trilogy offroad challenge mario kart fzero hydro thunder and to a lesser extent the rush trilogy wipeout was cool too
  my bad i meant constant 30  actually constant 30  not dropping to 12 or single digits all the fucking time especially on maps like abyss which are hard enough when the game runs correctly  there was some shitty ps2 one also i think that ran at 60 pc version also i think  san francisco rush is great for sure
anyone played aerogauge
    pc version is on steam now  but you cant use on of these bad boys on there hmm
  yeah i had one mrc was great with it
  yeah i have it on pc though i have to limit the framerate to 30 or else the games physics get fucked
  i could if i wanted to i could also smear shit on my screen if i wanted to
  13 on ebay used  should i do it
  go ahead but be sure that wheel is working fine
  mrc  my guy that game was the shit and no one i grew up with ever heard of it or played it
i had that same steering wheel for the psx didnt much care for it honestly
  i have one of these right now found for 8 at a local vinnies ive only used it once for a few minutes to test not even sure what all games i can use it for and its a bit of a hassle to set up since im so used to simply using a controller
im not so sure of the point of the steering wheel either to be honest with you they always felt a bit plasticy and cheap to me including when i was a kid on topic  san francisco rush fzero x mario kart 64 top gear rally
underrated as fuck
ridge racer 64 has lots of tracks from previous games and you can choose drift style and collision type great music youll find a track thats your song drifting takes some practice but its incredibly satisfying because its not just mapped to generic handbrake like modern games tend to do  wipeout 64 runs surprisingly well
any games like daytona usa or sega rally
  nah game is glitchy and unpolished as fuck and also no one knows how to play it    i bet you dont even use the r button to perform more intricate stunts you pleb
which game was better
  stop this bullshit theyre different both are great in their own ways
  ok relax i have both waiting for me and was just wondering what to play first
  youll end up playing both anyway so just get started
  fallout is amazing but i generally have more fun playing baldurs gate the combat goes faster and is more interesting       this the true though so either one is fine to start with
fallout is for the depressing atmosphere baldurs gate is for fun
they are pretty different as stated above if you are interested in playing both you should play both    if anything id say try fallout first and then baldurs gate just because i found fallout to have a very clunky/irritating turn system and bg moves at whatever pace you want i think it would feel restricting to play bg and then move to fallout    also make sure to have some vague expectations for what youre getting into  fallout has a lot more weight put on your characters abilities in combat and dialogue and is better for roleplaying  its not really relevant how strong/what type of character you make in bg its mostly for the feeling of exploring the world as a lowlevel adventurer about 95 of the content in bg is sidecontent so dont get hung up about trying to fill in every piece of the map if youre starting to get bored    i havent played fallout 2 but bg2 is fairly different to bg for future reference better for the most part
  play both and decide yourself which you liked better  protip both are good for different reasons
balidurs gate lets you slot more then one item and has acual class customization while being the truest digitial solo rpg expiernce you can possible get    fallout though has 4x the originality and more memorable characters/endings
whatre good builds for each fallout im always completely awful at building characters
  small guns speech stealing or doctor high agility and perception take the gifted and small frame traits and youre good to go for your first run
  fallout    its the better rpg its better made game its the better at what it does also
  well baldurs gate aint retro
is fallout tactics worth a run i have never played it
  are you stupid
  hes probably only ever played/heard of the ps2 version
  fallout  baldurs gate 1 is literally diablo in dnd  2 at least had pertinent dialogue and context for an rpg but still feels weaker than fallout
  its fun if you liked fallout and wanted to have a bit more involving combat system and if you always liked the idea of throwing grenades and sneaking around storywise its nothing interesting i personally beat the campaign once and sunk quite a few hours into the very niche multiplayer mode but its harder and harder to find people willing to play it online and it really benefits from houserules because some of the stuff is busted if left unchecked
  is tactics combat system much different from f1/f2 is it still turn based the one of few things i hated in fallouts combat system was fighting large groups of enemies did they repair that somehow
  fallout  a crazy sandbox of dialoge options quest solutions and fun to be had with lockpicking/hacking/pickpocketing     baldurs gate 1  exploration and tactical combat
  is tactics combat system much different from f1/f2   you get to crouch and crawl which can be used for cover throwing got a lot of new good grenades sneak is actually giving you feedback on whether its working or whether you fucked it up and you can fire from inside an armored car also you get to control your whole party  is it still turn based  it can be but truth be told tactics was first designed with a realtime mode in mind and tb was added later in development due to being a legacy thing playing with either mode works i must admit that i had more fun with rt mode especially since thats what people online play  the one of few things i hated in fallouts combat system was fighting large groups of enemies did they repair that somehow  well you get an entire squad of up to 6 people that you can control yourself instead of relying on bad ai and you can customize your squad to your liking so its not unlikely that you will end up with 6 heavily armored characters with either burst weapons or antimateriel rifles you can set a script for your snipers to always aim for one particular body part too meaning that you should have plenty of screenclearing ability especially in real time mode
  it sounds fun i will give it a try thanks anon
  this shit thread
  let me put it this way  tactics works as babys first tactical shooter it strikes the perfect balance between being accessible and still putting any sort of challenge in front of you  as for your questions the other anon already adressed them but my advice is the further you go the more you will end up relying on tb combat and mixing the twos in less intense moments enemies will eventually have enough skill and firepower to wipe out your entire team in less than five seconds meaning tb will be mandatory to not be simply overwhelmed    and one more thing the first 23 missions are introductionary crap they take forever if played tb so just rush the shit out of them in rt and use burst mode extensively you can easily resupply  as for gameplay mutate perk is fucking glorious because it allows you to pick gifted for all your squad members  and this is the only fallout game with good stealth so get riddick to your squad you will really appriciate
  but really tb is mostly useful as sort of pause for the most of the time you can simply carefully plan ahead what to do and where enemies are rather than being rushed from three sides and not knowing where to shoot
  tactical shooter  shooter
  game consists predominately of shooting at everything that moves  not a shooter
  hey i like tactical shooter games like rainbow six and swat 3  then youll like fallout tactics
    different anon but please indulge my curiosity and tell me what kind of game jagged alliance is by genre
  by genre  pick whichever suits it best turnbased strategy turnbased tactics tactical roleplaying game    its not a shooter shooting is not a defining part of the game melee builds and meleeoriented tactics exist the act of shooting itself is not something directly down to player input but is instead governed entirely by a set of skillchecks and calculations under the hood compare the gameplay of jagged alliance to virtua cop rail shooter doom firstperson shooter mdk thirdperson shooter or rainbow six tactical shooter the differences should be quite fundamental games like crusader no regret would be much easier to define as isometric shooters    if we were to take anons assertion as true then fallout 2 would also be considered a shooter game the moment you can fire your minigun three times in a turn which is just ridiculous
  but conversely by following your logic we would have to describe tactics as active pause tactical roleplaying game  and it fits none of those words aside game taking into account it was even marketed as a tactical shooter mainly due to the rt capacity and is played as such in multiplayer
  but conversely by following your logic we would have to describe tactics as active pause tactical roleplaying game  yeah although where do you have active pause in ft aside from going to the options menu to switch to turnbased whenever it gets too frantic i dont see anything nearly as fluid as the baldurs gate setup  also you insist on the tactical shooter terminology and then say that the tactical roleplaying game moniker doesnt work even though the word tactical appears in both names and fallout tactics has way more roleplaying game pedigree in general given that it hails from the fallout series and is even still built on the same roleplaying game system as the original games just because its not a game for fans of deep storylines or that it eschews speech checks and dialogue doesnt mean its not an rpg    id also like to find out the marketing that claims ft is a tactical shooter although im not sure it matters because in 2018 we can probably put these things into perspective we do not call fpses doomclones anymore either
  although where do you have active pause in ft  ability of going between rt and tb with single key at any given moment you didnt have to go to any menu i think it was space bar but definitely one of the keys on keyboard  and i dont insist on anything im just pointing flaw in trying to apply retarded categorisation    as for the claim  blurb on the game cover really hard to miss
  ability of going between rt and tb with single key at any given moment  thats a very large stretch from active pause  and i dont insist on anything  you implied tactical is not a word that describes fallout tactics by saying that none of the words in active pause tactical roleplaying game fit the description of the game other than game  as for the claim  blurb on the game cover  you mean the tagline that says postnuclear tactical combat on the front cover or any of the sentences on this back cover i dont see it anywhere    my entire point is that we should agree that the term shooter has been pretty welldefined and that a fan of shooters wouldnt care for fallout tactics
  easily fallout    while bg is notable for reinvigorating fantasy crpgs it didnt really do anything original like fallout    fallout was a milestone title
  i dont like adnd 2e so ima go with fallout
  not part of the argument but you blind
  i dont see the word shooter either
fallout  bg2  fallout 2
  do i fit in now /vr/  please tell i do
i never liked fallout 2its a big step down from fallout 1  in baldurs gate 1 and 2 you can invest hundreds of hours in while in fallout 1 it takes like 20 hours to finish all the content and i wouldnt even say fallout 1 is a better game than lets say baldurs gate 2  so i will definetly take baldurs gate over fallout
  i love fallout more but baldurs gate is way better on a technical level the interface is smooth the graphics are more detailed and the controls flow much better fallout has a real clunky interface with fundamentals outdated for the time as in small ass buttons and slow clicking   fallout has a more interesting ruleset though its made to be a crpg rather than an adaption of pnp which is weird because fallout is turn based but bg semireal time    i never liked fallout 2its a big step down from fallout 1  fallout 2 really screwed the themes in the pursuit of being zany 1 had a better story 2 got too fucking goofy a lot of fanboys refuse to acknowledge this though they act like the original fallout was some super serious nietzschelike commentary its like they havent played the originals in a decade
  its another episode of memout 2 meming  daily reminder fallout 1 opens with fucking pulp fiction reference and the rest of the game is just as goofy but contrarians will never tell you that claiming it was that superserious postapo game that never ever did jokes or memes uhuh
  you see ed ed is dead  that was a pulp fiction reference 1 it was a minor text prompt on a corpse you can easily skip over 2 even if it is a pulp fiction reference a background reference or homage is not too much zany and goofy no one here said there was anything wrong with those  contrarians will never tell you that claiming it was that superserious postapo  notice the following sentence  they act like the original fallout was some super serious nietzschelike commentary its like they havent played the originals in a decade  through basic reading comprehension its obvious both allouts are being referred to fallout 1 was not super serious but it struck a good balance between the black comedy aspects and the serious themes fallout 2 while a good game and improving technically went to far into the zany humor side this is an admission by one of the developers in fact     chris avellone says he could write a treatise on why he thinks making deathclaws peaceful and friendly was a fundamentally bad idea imo if you want to build a strong franchise you focus on the elements that make it work and regulate all the wouldnt it be interesting if ideas that dont fit to special encounters ive always hated aliens in fallout for example and as ive often told tim cain i was pretty fucking pissed off he thought including ghosts in fallout was a good idea its like youre opening the goddamn door to the spirit world in a postapoc game and thats a whole separate aesthetic detour in a franchise thats already been placed in danger of losing its direction by being given to a bunch of newbs  read the whole article here 
comparing a partybased rpg to a single player single character one    love them both
  fallout 1 is a lot of humour because its a postapocalyptic setting the genre is inherently kind of silly going back to the road warrior movie    it isnt however a ridiculous self parody like fallout 2
fallout and baldurs gate however arent really directly comparable when i was a kid i liked fallout better for the unique setting and noncombat options as an adult i enjoy baldurs gate more simply for its replayability both are classics    when i was a kid i also loved fallout 2 for its sex and violence but i find it tedious and juvenile today
objectively i think bg is better due to the better gameplay and more game time    but apples to oranges
  theyre both mediocre shit play superior rpgs like wizardry and might  magic instead
  complains about reading comprehension  cant even properly quote what was said and must pull reinterpretation  no wonder you consider fo1 to be a serious game with just small amount of humour  alternatively you are too dense and/or underexposed to popculture to grasp all the references and winks its doing
  baldurs gate was objectively better    fallout was more of an rpg had actual speech checks actual noncombat checks besides locks/traps items interacting with environment and had that right click for info thing that i really loved in pretty much every other way bg was better     theyre both really good but bg is one of my favorite games ever whereas fallout is just good       this    somewhat unrelated note a few threads ive had open for basically all day just died within about 5 minutes of each othershill raid
  youre just butthurt for being proven wrong with actual facts and reasons  cant even properly quote what was said and must pull reinterpretation  what the fuck are you talking about shithead it just pulled a paragraph from the article i sourced which is mostly a direct quote from chris avellone further proof you have terrible reading comprehension   alternatively you are too dense and/or underexposed to popculture to grasp all the references and winks its doing  read this sentence again you cousin fucking inbred dolt  fallout 2 really screwed the themes in the pursuit of being zany 1 had a better story 2 got too fucking goofy a lot of fanboys refuse to acknowledge this though they act like the original fallout was some super serious nietzschelike commentary its like they havent played the originals in a decade  where did i 1 say fallout 1 is devoid of pop culture references 2 equivocate having homages and winks with being too zany and goofy or 3 infer the original fallout was super serious with an ounce of humor in fact i said   fallout 1 was not super serious but it struck a good balance between the black comedy aspects and the serious themes  you may fallout 1 sound like some shitty nostalgia tripper and nothing else like ready player one do you seriously enjoy that not even fallout 2 is like that   the point is fallout 1 had fun references and little jokes and cool thematic inspirations like mad max but they were subdued which made for better writing fallout 2 degraded the writing because the staff got too bogged in horseshit zaniness and meta humor like    this is similar to whats said by chris avellone considered one of the best if not the best writers in the industry so eat shit you obviously produce enough of it
  u mad  is the one really mad  cant into reading comprehension
fallout is overall better but i wish tim cains games didnt have a weird aversion to full party control
  baldurs gate has less grognards
  absolutely shill raid look at all the fake and jewish commenters on here suddenly spamming up threads with nothing but contempt and irate hatred you can tell when someone posts something preposterous and so many instantly reply with shitty generic retorts they do this to crash threads and divert focus
fight magus one on one finally getting your revenge like a real man  or  wimp out and not only let him go but have him join your party so you can take your shame of being a pussy wherever you go    daily reminder that if you let magus join your party then youre a true beta
  true courage is about knowing not when to take a life but when to spare one
  this guy thanks the man who fucks his wife
i didnt know man i just thought i was supposed to kill him
  ian mckellen hes gay bro
  not doing both on separate playthroughs to see what happens  what was it like to be a dull child
  fenceshitter  the only child here is you
kill magus  sell his amulet to some retarded nu for 1 gp
implying making a broken man do your bidding 7th banana in a group of misfits that pale in majesty compared to his former glory isnt the ultimate revenge    do you even vendetta
  letting magus live in your head rent free even after killing him instead of putting him to work fixing his own damn misitake   whats lower than beta only asking because youd be sure to know
    roflmao
  how could you deny the oppertunity to force this sister fucking weirdo to sit through a thousand more lifetimes of abject misery haunted by the collapse of zeal and being betrayed by his own mom
  the only pussy here is alfador
    this guy gets whats going on its like killing everyone in a gang and then making the last guy alive been your personal driver for the next 30 years just to remind him what a pussy bitch he was
every time ive played ive let him join me because its just extra content for the game and the storyline of chrono trigger is so basic and goofy that ive never felt emotionally invested in any sort of revenge on any of the villains in it really
  is there a good fantran not a fan of woolsey
i dont like magus but stopping lavos takes priority over any vendettas
  ds version
  even trusting that guy  bad idea
  whats he gonna do lose to you again
  he tries to crash your car killing you  youre level 70 only does 10 damage  big mistake noob
  cant make up his mind  making a second save instead of doing another playthrough  faggot
  fantran    the fuck is this shit ive never seen this word in my life and all of a sudden its in 10 threads is the new dual orbs forced maymay
  the ds version translation is closer to original japanese
  iirc you cant get new game  if you dont have all the characters alive
  mods
  it still is mostly based on woolseys translation just reworded it also still uses masamune for the macguffin sword despite it clearly being a broadsword seriously its called granleon
  and thats the problem
  or grandleon im never sure on the spelling
believing in alphabeta dynamics is positively upsilon
  
  do have an iota of selfrespect you little lambda i beta youre so omega that a nu could kappa your epsilon if he delta heavy blow tau you are you even a real gamma
  choosing some halfassembled vendetta  not choosing having a badass vegeta
  shut up you phiggot
  when i first played it i obviously didnt know he joins your party if you free him so i gave zero fucks about killing him
  killing magus and stopping lavos are not mutually exclusive
  keep magus alive but let chrono stay dead  the patrician playthrough
  thanks for the spoiler faggot
  edgy balding faggot  badass
  i cant believe theres fags who actually say yes
  revenge isnt manly its not about revenge
whats the point of adding more characters to your party when youre ever only going to use 3 anyways
  different characters are stronger in different situations youll want to experiment with all of their combo techs the triple techs that magus can do require that you find special items to equip but one of those techs in particular is powerfully destructive
  different situations    its chrono trigger if you have any difficulty beating the game with any combination of 3 characters you just might be mentally handicapped
  the strongest party is always chrono robo ayla tho    except for lavos at ocean palace where ayla cant tank the spikes and you need lucca
    there are techs specific to certain combos that could be different from what your party composition normally is its fun to play around with them even if you dont necessarily need them    i remember using twin charm to get some really great items off of bosses and other major enemies
  look everyone its the faggot that pops into random threads telling everyone that fun isnt a good reason for anything    yes faggot we know the concept of fun is foreign to you like a caveman looking at an airplane youll just have to understand that its a concept that exists and that you may never get it but the rest of the world agrees its a good reason to do things thats just the world you live in
  oh my fucking god imagine being so mentally handicapped as to write a post like this seriously whats wrong with you you little faggot daddy didnt shower you with enough sperm after cucking youre mom just because someone can have different opinions doesnt mean those opinions arent wrong there is no zero nil reason to utilise any extra characters beyond the point you are able to use three characters thats it none at all i dont give a shit what your onionsslurping ass has to say about things but the simple fact is if you choose to waste time and effort training other characters even going so far as to be a basic bitch and let that evil fuck magus join your team after everything he did to you then your thoughts and actions are wrong pure and simple
  holy fuck
  this i spared him my first playthrough because a friend told me he would join my party but never ended up using him on my next i killed him to see what happens and because i felt like frog deserved to have his revenge now i realize the best revenge is sparing his life but forcing him to sit at the end of time with the old man for all eternity while you save the world from his mistake and become heroes      implying you need magus help to stop lavos  partly why i also like killing him youre like some badass janitor who kills the asshole who makes a mess before cleaning it up like a boss
the best revenge is sparing magus putting him in your party and letting him die at the hands of queen zeal and never reviving him
   out  there is no wimp out magus is a pushover its a foregone conclusion that if it came to blows youd kick his ass for the second time as the first time you kicked his ass your party was weaker and he was at full strength by the time this event takes place magus is a shadow of his former glory he knows it you know it the question is whether you feel like finishing what you started or making him suffer the ultimate humiliation of being made to be the unquestioning servant of his conqueror     i rather like him as a party member his spells make him versatile against all different kinds of opponents and he can deal shadow damage which is always a heavy hitter
  op didnt understand a shit    frog even if i beat you now crono wont   come back   or cyrus either    magus 
  who fucking cares just spam luminaire dipshit
  his spells make him versatile against all different kinds of opponents  just spam luminaire dipshit
  magus is already completely broken by the time frog has the chance for his revenge there is no way to make him feel remorse because remorse is already all he has you cant hurt him because he is already hollowed out and feels nothing everything he had spent hundreds of years doing failed and instead he was saved by someone who had no reason to care about him he doesnt save anyone he loved or cared about he just survives after watching everyone else get completely owned by a big alien monster his home is gone his sister is still dead his mom is still brainwashed that he even lets frog fight him is just an act of kindness from him towards someone who he hurt for what it turns out was for no reason    killing him isnt revenge its just closure but frogs real closure only happens when he meets cyrus ghost so its really just nothing    youre just killing a guy who doesnt even care if he lives or dies who no one cares if he lives or dies except a cat    all that happens if you kill magus is that you make a cat sad
always spare why would you intentionally miss out on a party member thats about as retarded as attacking yuffie because shes a thief    also magus is the only character who gets shadow magic and yeah the game is piss easy but with the only other choices being 2 water users a fire user and lightning user it seems retarded to ignore the only way to add another element because of plot reasons and even that doesnt make sense since frog clearly realizes killing magus wont bring cyrus back
    seething brainlets  my sides anyone with a brain did that you retards
  also magus is the only character who gets shadow magic  sort of robo does shadow damage if i am not mistaken
  hey hows sonichu doing by the by
  pick the bitch option  frog bitches out    woooooow
  has to do damage control days later while he changes his diaper  just fucking lol
  paying 50 for a game and not playing it more than once  there is no meme image to express my contempt for you
  if he was so focused on getting revenge youd have thought that at some point he would have wondered if it was possible for him and his time travel buddies to go back in time and save cyrus i mean they do it to save laras legs and im pretty sure her having legs is less important for history than cyrus being fucking dead
  they dont get to choose the times that they can go back to
  right but god or whatever made up shit lets them go back in time to save moms legs but not the hero seems pretty fucked up if i was frog id go apeshit then again isnt that canonically what he does inbetween chrono trigger and cross maybe it all makes sense now
  games werent meant to be replayed
  if that was the case arcades and video games as a whole would have fucking died permanently before the crash
  arcades  because they did financially great didnt they
  the patrician party is crono frog and magus  op is a faggot
  the kind of people who put magus in their party are the ones with long hair listening to screamo in their moms basement at 30
      holy shit these posts fucking slayed my sides
  why are you so angry do you really think the world is going to respond to your outrage with love lucca gets a second chance because she did nothing but sacrifice herself for others and try to save people even though she was afflicted with tragedy she used her talents as best she could even though it must have hurt her every time she remembered she did it to try to make the world better    frog isnt really acting out of altruism its all junk like honor and duty and revenge hes not trying to atone for anything hes just selfishly trying to regain his own sense of selfworth cyrus himself was essentially a serial killer whose actions were supposedly justified by war but he immediately took that decision for granted and chose violence as the only answer even though mystics are literally just mutated human beings never at any point did cyrus try to talk to or understand his enemies or find a different solution or compromise    the world doesnt owe you anything when you give nothing and just think about what you should get when you only act out of desire for reward what you end up receiving is never actually love its just life compromising with you to tolerate your existence and the fact that your actions arent entirely your own fault because you were a victim once
  did magus actually do anything to chrono  co though
  he led the enemy faction in the middle ages and tried to keep you from meddling with his plans in zeal
  he led the enemy faction in the middle ages  he actually shows no signs of doing any such thing   tried to keep you from meddling with his plans in zeal  which really wasnt wrong he was on the side of justice all along
  i killed him to avenge chrono because im an alpha
  snes version with the uncensor patch and translation fix    
exacting petty irrelevant revenge on someone who wanted to save the world instead of accepting their help towards the common goal      all this bullshit  real reason is that they wanted to do a sidequest that has no real impact on the story      holy shit triggerniggers
  hey man just because people make boring things doesnt mean i cant make them better with my headcanon
  actually its ayla  chrono  robo in that order because they represent past  present  future
  i murder the fuck out of magus on each and every playthrough that shitter is a perpetual fuck up that gets whats coming to him    also based on other peoples playthroughs ive read about the dudes dead weight shit stats shit gear shit magic unless you grind the fuck out of him few crosstechs and zero unique dialogue absolutely no reason to let this fucker live
  shit stats shit gear shit magic unless you grind the fuck out of him  he can deal all types of magic damage his magic damage using dark matter even in the 40 levels is better than any offensive techs except luminaire and flare and he usually deals more damage having a naturally higher mag stats he also deals more physical damage than marle or lucca making him a little more versatile i almost always let him live on 1st playthroughs so i can spam damage with chrono lucca magus using luminaire flare and dark matter
  all that happens if you kill magus is that you make a cat sad  only autistic rage monsters kill magus and make cats sad
    if anyone is interested he kinda proves that segacdgenesismd and pc are superior and the nintendo version is bad due to certain design choices and bad sounds
shit game who cares about your ecelebs opinion    was stuck with this game as a kid actually managed to beat it holy shit this game has a crazy input lag on any action want to turn around have to watch the slow ass animation of the character doing so want to take a stop while running same have to watch the character slowly wind down etc etc
  found the zoomer    and nice fanfiction
  eceleb  are you retarded all his videos are completely historical and technical not some over the top mouthpiece trying to find sponsorship bux for their youtube career your whole post reads like one of those indignant ignorance posts on plebbit fishing for upvotes i see them all the time on the one good gaming subreddit /games/ its so fucking clear 90 of the posters have never played any game theyre commenting on and are just fishing for upvotes based on some comment meant to sound like it might be true based on everything is terrible and im so enlightened for knowing it attitude
  pretty much this    as for the video the sega yamaha chip was so fucking powerful that it was ridiculous
  nintendo version is bad due to certain design choices and bad sounds  no surprise here    salty boi
its an overlooked gem    hmmmmmmm did metaljesus copyright the word hidden also rgb btfo once again
  its more like we all know it exists but no one ever gave a dime to play it nowadays    and i loved the pc version when i was a kid i wish there it was a way to play it without using vmware or pcem
  go back now
  ignore the /r/edditor and move on
remember to report e celeb trash
  svideo or bust
you just made this thread to shit on nintendofags
  emulator blur  imagine the rainbow banding on real hardware
  composite soul  rgb soulless
  pitfall 2  thats not pitfall 2 its not even pitfall 3
  its not even pitfall 3    pitfall ii lost caverns was released on the 2600 colecovision 5200 and a whole bunch of other platforms back in the day     but what is pitfall iii i thought super pitfall was just a remake of the second game
    there was also the arcade version to which sega made a number of changes  but technically no pitfall 3
  imagine the rainbow banding on real hardware    i know the guy who made this video to some degree and he does use real hardware and games for his dfretro videos but that example does look like he blurred in in photo shop or something     the genesis doesnt even have svideo support it only had composite and rca for north america and japan though it does have rgb for pal regions i think the only way to get svideo was through mods     but yea i had a genesis model 1 and 2 back in the day and played them with composite and the rainbow color banding was really noticeable in many games sonic 2 being a great example     
  though it does have rgb for pal regions i think  every sega console has superb rgb across all regions and the genesis as a matter of fact is often said to have the best rgb output of any console
  every sega console has superb rgb across all regions and the genesis as a matter of fact is often said to have the best rgb output of any console    yeah but unfortunately rgb tvs were not available in ntsc regions
  the atari 8bit version of pitfall 2 has a full second quest after you beat the original game activision fucked up hard by not releasing that as a standalone game and calling it pitfall 3 like it pretty much is    i thought super pitfall was just a remake of the second game  super pitfall is pitfall in name only and is not even remotely a remake of anything
pitfall the mayan adventure hd remaster when  the graphics were handdrawn so if they still have the animation cels and background paintings they can probably be rescanned in hd  also it would eliminate the dithering issues    i think an hd remaster of pitfall the mayan adventure would be amazing
  rgb tvs were not available in ntsc regions  but rgb monitors were
  while that would be cool i would be content with a gog release of the win95 edition that works on modern oss
  yeah  a gog release of the win95 version would be decent too    but personally i think that video games which were handdrawn benefit the most from hd remasters too bad no one realized this    the mega man x legacy collection had some games with anime fmvs which were done on analog 35mm film but they were just upscaled and letterboxed from the ps1 files instead of being digitally restored and remastered which wouldve been better    policenauts could also be a great one all of the graphics there were either cels or paintings and the anime fmvs were also done in 35mm film  they could rescan the artwork and digitally restore and remaster the fmvs as well if konami decides to wise up and actually do a rerelease of policenauts    one great example i can think of is the dragons lair trilogy which also includes space ace and while it may have been cropped from the original 43 aspect ratio the remaster looks gorgeous even if the files are just 720p
  activision still holds the damn rights  unless trump throws a sherman at them is impossible to get those even mechwarrior 2 rights and src are with them
  genesis can do svideo with a simple mod its a very common one so im not surprised they would show it
  japan only had composite  not true it could output rgb via a 21 pin scart type connector
  yes they developed it  they can work with the original animation studio in remastering the game
  if i go by carey chico and ken millers words    everything is lost along with battlezone 98 and i76 source code
  well they can reverseengineer the sega cd game or the win95 game just like what bluepoint does with their hd remasters    the real question is are the original animation cels and backgrounds still wellpreserved
  as if
  the genesis as a matter of fact is often said to have the best rgb output of any console  by idiots who have never actually seen rgb from any other console
    anybody who read videogame mags back in the day knew this anyway not exactly a controversial opinion
  i wish pc version could work well on modern pcs its just the wail32 dll file that is busted and the game isnt recognizing the audio drivers
  use pcem
  harrys genesis sprite looks ugly fuck even though it uses more than enough colors
its not a very good game anyway
    fuck off faggot
  to be fair the jailbars are a pretty easy fix      someone shills a youtube video and gets criticized for it  receives youre zoomer and reddit accusations from people who are almost assuredly a zoomer and an actually admitted redditor respectively  i honestly think eceleb threads should be allowed if given one single general thread and the only talk allowed is about retrogame videos and discussing the opinions therein especially given how long gccx threads have been allowed but come on try not to be so transparent
  go back
  to be fair the jailbars are a pretty easy fix  if youre lucky on some revisions the jailbars cant be fixed no matter what you do
  yes and we never had problems with dfretroor other retro documentary videos theres some good shit that you learn from them    its only one or 2 autists who knew 4chan yesterday and wants to sperg shit to gain props like if this is fucking reddit  yesterday the janitors erased and banned some shitters derailing the stephen hilemburgs death thread on /co/
love the video so far  and im subscribing
  nintendo version is bad due to certain design choices and bad sounds  no surprise here  its more complicated than just that  the snes ram was halved from 128kb to 64kb before release  this meant typically that most ports from other systems to snes cut graphics either extra frames of animations added loading times to load graphics to ram or removed graphics sound effects and levels altogether     decompress too since who got biggest chip to store those graphics to begin with was down to corporate politics and yamauchi was a little bitch about that point the single biggest reason why namco and square fucked off to sony asap
  what was the godfather thinking when he halved the snes memory for fucks sake
  the snes ram was halved from 128kb to 64kb before release  this meant typically that most ports from other systems to snes cut graphics either extra frames of animations added loading times to load graphics to ram or removed graphics sound effects and levels altogether  actually there are plenty of other better reasons why these things happened on snes remember the mega drive also had only 64 kb of vram    1 snes uses the less compressible bitplane format while md uses packed pixel     2 snes has less cpu power for decompression    3 snes restricts sprite data access to 16 kb out of 64 kb vram rest is dedicated to backgrounds meanwhile md lets sprites occupy any percentage of its 64 kb vram which is a way more flexible approach    4 snes doesnt allow for nonsquare shaped sprites while md does this means any sprites on snes which arent square shaped waste vram/rom for no good reason    5 snes only supports two types of sprite sizes on screen at once while md has no restriction on sprite sizes this means that if the snes is displaying a sprite which doesnt match either of the two chosen sprite sizes it is doing so by padding the sprite data wasting vram/rom for no good reason    6 snes sound samples eat up rom space mds dont since it uses fm not sampled music
  6 snes sound samples eat up rom space mds dont since it uses fm not sampled music  the data for the music instructions is ofcourse tiny but not nonexistent and the genesis can use samples
  yeah but in a comparison its irrelevant because they both need to store instructions for their music programs and while md can play samples its only a very minor part of its music capabilities
  console architecture is such a train wreck you wonder how they even managed to make so many great games on it
  i think trip hawkins said it best he said that if you wanted to do beautiful colored backdrops that scroll slowly the snes is great but if you want to do anything with serious animation the md is the clear winner
  it comes to the fact that sega jp also had experience in manufacturing computers in jp while nintendo has no experience at it  so they picked the best parts and created the best architecture for the time which also included the yamaha sound chip    you have no problems emulating sega stuff nowadays besides naomi or saturn genesis era games has no bugs   as for nintendo some games still has some bugs due to the clusterfuck that it was the snes hardware
  yeah but also i forgot it uses ram to control the soundchip the snes soundchip has independent ram and cpu which gurantees accurate sound in all regions  lots of modern chiptune for genesis nes and c64 could not be played with a game as they are just to resource intensive no c64 game used ring modulation during gameplay cause that shit was intense
  but that example does look like he blurred in in photo shop or something  literally says blur applied    you think
  the snes soundchip has independent ram and cpu which gurantees accurate sound in all regions  errr not necessarily there are some snes games with slower pal music like lost vikings 2
i played the windows 95 version it let you select a level after you completed it i also enjoyed playing the original 2600 game that came with it
  you must hate the first super mario brothers
    pal mds dont have rainbow banding and a simple 32x passthrough fixes it even on ntsc units
this game probably has one of the best /vr/ endings     also does anyone know what the original pitfall runs off of within mayan treasure is it an emulation or is it a recreation
    third gen rf  fourth gen composite  fifth gen svideo  sixth gen component    second gen bare wires  first gen stone ugg ugg me smash you now
  third gen rf  fourth gen composite  fifth gen svideo  sixth gen component    the nes has composite while the master system did not at default the snes has svideo as well and nintendo did sell svideo cables though genesis did not though the genesis does support rgb even though it was never really available in north america the turbo grafx 16/ pc engine also had composite   the sega dreamcast supported vga
  what noooo i dont believe it
i bought this thing during black friday and its pretty neat havent played c64 games in years and its fun to go back and realise that i absolutely suck at them    but holy shit is this stick that comes with it bad does anyone know what usb controller can be a good replacement for this i tried my ps4 controller that didnt work for whatever reason and slowed the game down and the arcade stick that i have didnt work ps3 controllers didnt work and all and i dont have a cable for my 360 controllers    also does anyone know how to get joysticks to work on some games i tried mr dos castle the game works and starts but doesnt respond to the controller     a c64 recommendation thread would be nice too
can we discuss fzero and fzero x  which game do you prefer  best track  best song
  manchild shite    go play wipeout instead
  hi cee
the one with the loop with the barrel the twist and the jump you know the one with the blind straight
  i prefer wipeout
  thats an impostor
  i always found it funny how wipeout devs put all their money on putting out the adult mature serious business type of futuristic race game with all these jet set in themes and circuit introdutions that were loaded with snobbish shit like the races actually generate dynamo energy for cities like you need a serious motive to race in the first place   lets be real podracing is for nerds
my favorite is fzero x though i could never finish all cups on either game  best tracks are port town crazy call at cry from x and fire field from the original
fav track is probably silence          hyperpretentious mature futuristic racing game  has cartracer tier weapon and item mechanics  inb4 bbut the time trials  have fun on your empty track you autistic manchild
  x hard to choose a single track
  similar to comparing starfox with starfox 64 both the og and fzero x have different pluses and minuses which makes it hard to determine which is ultimately better but i would say fzero x narrowly beats the original
gx  x  fzero  maximum velocity  gp legend
imagine if n64 used cds instead of carts    
  anti skill man child discredits effort and high level by calling it autism to feel better about how incapable and pathetic he is    do you play with fwendz
dream chaser guitar arrange is the goat
  effort  high skill  cringe
  fzero is not a good game came there only to say this
  takes videogames über seriously  calls others pathetic manchildren  oh the irony
  elaborate
  the guitar arrange is one of my favorite albums of all time too bad every single version online comes from the same scratched cd rip and none of the current owners are willing make a new upload
it does suprise me that wipeout generally gains more traction on this board
  hardly wo threads are dead as fuck too the franchise slapfights are what keeps threads for both series afloat
i love the classic fzero but x all the way  i even prefer it to gx which is almost as good but x is just more fierce  best track  
  excellent post
whatever stage where its like that giant lava ramp thing not warning your friends back in the day then having them all die was classic sips
seriously fuck those orange anonymous racers
  why are wipeoutfags like this  i actually enjoyed fzero x and wipeout both but wipeout people like this make me wish i never fucking played it desu    most reasonable post in the thread  fzero xs rainbow road is pretty fun   i hope you fags unlocked the joker cup
does /vr/ like sonic robo blast 2 have any of you played the kart mod or made anything for it
pretty based the engine works better as a kart racer than a traditional sonic game that being said i really dig the low poly 3d models for srb2    
  this looks like the saturn/pc sonic 4 we never got is it a nightmare to setup
  unless the physics changed in srb2 i dont care for it when i tried to play it a couple years ago i found it a bit disorienting something about the fast movement and the way the camera moved put me off and i dont get that way with the official 3d sonics nor do i with doom  srb2kart is pretty good but i only played it for a few hours im hoping they add more official characters to it in the future but the track list is insanely large for a first release they could stand to cut some of the lowerquality tracks in my opinion though
  its easy to set up and really  interesting  the speed can be disorienting and the levels are huge  its definitely worth a look though
  had the same issue and switching to tails fixed it his speed is just right sonic goes so fast it makes the game unplayable
  no such thing as too fast
  ive played both games though im holding my judgement on srb2 since the next update is gonna overhaul a lot of shit srb2kart on the other hand is really good for what it is i hope it remains alive and active throughout the near future
  i played it on dreamcast ages ago if im thinking of the same thing i had no idea what it was when i downloaded it but i remember really liking it this kart video looks great ill have to check it out
  nice where do i get it
  the official srb2 site should be the first result of searching srb2 theres a blogpost about srb2kart in there that links to the download
new thief thread  the 20th anniversary contest drops in just 5 days
bump
  2nd for puffywav      also what thief ost is your favorite and what is your favorite song from each game
3rd for hammerites best faction
4th for op not knowing that you need 3 posts with images to make sure your new thread doesnt get removed
  genuinely did not know this
which game is considered the best of the franchise or the must play  the series are literally dirt cheap on steam and gog right now due to sales but id rather buy just a couple
  you cant go wrong with gold and 2
  the mage towers is far from my favorite mission but it may have my favorite music i really like the strings in the main tower and the air and earth tower music and also the creepy synths in the courtyards      1 and 2 are the best which one is down to preference get both play gold first expect zombies the gog versions are good
tfw taking friday off work so i can play dank fms and talk about them here
  isnt that only on boards with it as a specific rule like most of the porn boards
hi anon 
  im not sure if its my favourite but the first half of  sticks with me from thief 2  it evokes a deep space scene as much as it does the shadowcast undercroft of a dormant manor the consistent shift between keys sets a torpid rhythm as the volume increases with each sweep on the high key to a peak you can feel a churning of water under under your feet like great waves the pulsing electric hum and quavering chime of the theme of metalcraft and electrical machinery try to smother the ceaseless patient drone of pure thief in the background that you can more easily isolate later in the piece there is a distinct sense of unease i dont find this one calming the opposite in fact it perfectly captures the feeling of trespassing and running out of time but still being able to savour the falsecoziness of a claustrophobic basement where only sleeping servants and dozing guards dwell     from 1 i choose the first part of   i love being out on the prowl in the city ive written a few of short stories focusing on it my favourite fms involve creeping catlike along sprawling residential labyrinths and i think this piece captures the combination of having a spring in your step for a night on the town yet through the least conventional avenues and out of every streetlight
nextlevel texture work in song of the caverns
  this is beautifully written anon and i absolutely agree with everything you said i love the lonely creepy atmosphere of running interference    id also add that i adore the tile area soundscapes used in baffords in the upper floor before the throne room it sounds both dangerous and very lonely as well
  i am myself towards hammerites but this song is probably my favourite  
  i love being out on the prowl in the city ive written a few of short stories focusing on it     do you publish them somewhere i have an internet zine that focuses on avant garde stuff and im interested in your work  if youre interested mail me my email address is  here
  this is toptier but lets not try to turn this thread into some kind of circlejerk
  too late for that
    pretty sure thats board specific and normally for high traffic/pr0n boards to limit spamming
spiders
thief gold but its modded to be a dungeon crawler rpg
  a journey into the underdark
  actual mod is it
just bought thief 1 and 2 from steam   anything i should do before i get started  which do i play first
  the first what kind of question is that
  anything i should do before i get started  tfix and tafferpatcher and youre good to go  which do i play first  this should be fairly selfexplanatory unless you happen to post from a civilization that hasnt invented a numeral system of its own yet if the latter is the case give me a sec and ill call my local australopithecus linguist
  its a t2 fm where the three difficulties are three classes its a pretty decent mission      tfix and tafferpatcher and youre good to go  use tfix lite instead of the regular tfix though
use this unsupported version of tfix because this other one adds a random fence in 1 one mission that blocks the player from using a shortcut that saves all of 5 seconds
  t voodoo47
  what kind of support do you think a compatibility patch needs that it doesnt already have
  t autistic frog      i had to spend half an hour fucking around with the config files because tfix lite made the game run like shit on my computer normal tfix had no issues whatsoever and the game ran smoothly right off the bat
  what exactly
  not our fault youre too retarded to modify cam_extcfg/your rig is too shitty to handle newdark without someone else tampering with it
  the wall trap in the keeper compound in the haunted cathedral you can climb over the wall in the original game bypassing the locked door but tfix puts a fence there to prevent you from doing just that a very minor issue completely blown out of proportion by a few autists that id wager most people wont ever notice and id rather have to lockpick that door than waste my time doing what this retard says 
  a very minor issue    sure thing my retard also enjoy your shitty colored lighting in a game that didnt support it and those stupid meshes that install whether or not you choose to
tfw its finally over
  wwhat do you mean
    got em thanks anons im going to enjoy them for sure
  after spending an inordinate amount of time on it my contest mission is done
  vooodoo47  who
  congrats anon
  when you deliberately remove player options from the level design of immersive sims you are completely ignorant of the developers design philosophy and you should stop developing those fixes blocking paths that are part of the original level design is not the job of third party bug fixers lgs added ladders outside proper level structures just in case curious players managed to manipulate the environment enough to make it past those boundaries being able to do stupid shit is what these games are for and insisting that you know better than the level designers is impossibly arrogant youre not the genius surpassing the masters youre the retard so stupid that he thinks that hes the genius
  theres newdark but why no prdark zdark xpdark windark darkspasm nor darkrequiem sourceports
  you are using darkloader  i was stopped right after i started seeing that q everywhere instead of the regular ol hammers at first i thought that the authors of retreival meant to reference the death of garrett somehow their mission is the one that more openly than others references the ttlg forums and the dromed community after all but apparently that wasnt the case id always known about darkloaders fundamental flaw but since i never suffered from it i thought i could have worried about it another day now ive got some cleaning to do in the games directory but for now im enjoying the scene the hammerites being overtaken by this heretical new cult
  because the newdark team is the only one who made a port so far
  and finally another part of this fm i loved sneaking up on someone from below gives you an advantage on whos above you sure but as long as you dont know whats up there youre still vulnerable its a natural kind of challenge since you cant rely on all your senses like you usually do   not as hard as it may look at first especially after the two guards with the overlapping patrol route have been dealt with but it was a fun obstacle to deal with really felt like i was trying to take a castle by surprise only that there wasnt any castle to take among those walls    bloodstone prison is next the third mission by kung fu gecko not his last but the next will be on t2 soon that game will enter this chronology were following so well have to keep an eye on that  another hammerite prison this time haunted from top to bottom a fellow thief and exkeeper who doesnt want us killed for a change and a holy sword that could help us fight the undead sounds promising
  bloodstone prison is fantastic
    
  give me a quick rundown on murappr
  sauce on that
  that last one is some silent hill level shit
  quite obvious its that loud sound apparitions make its located in res/sndcrf/sfx/murapprwav    wasnt it in some ingame video  
  oh yes right its from the ending cutscene except its in higher quality and a bit different      has anyone played t2x is it good 
  its worth a play its a comfy adventure with some nice missions     dont let the shills get your hopes up too high though its also deeply flawed the sound and art directions are both questionable and the main character is an insufferable edgelord cunt literally an unironic coldsteel the hedgehog
  what thief ost is your favorite and what is your favorite song from each game  i think nothing beats opening credits for the first game it set up the whole tone for the setting with just handful of beats
  literally an unironic coldsteel the hedgehog   meaning  it rings me absolutely nothing aside guessing this must be somehow related with sonic  which i never played
  
  has anyone played t2x is it good  its very good but its on the easy side the game is noticeably easier than thief 1 and 2 with far less strict loot requirements and restrictions on killing
  the main character is an insufferable edgelord cunt  no she isnt shes a naive young girl convinced by a manipulative man to act as his instrument of revenge shes not edgy shes brainwashed by a liar to see nothing but vile hateful monsters around her because he wants her lust for vengeance to cloud her judgement it eventually does and she just obeys his commands unquestioningly that development isnt written or delivered fantastically its pretty hamfisted but shes not just nothing personnel
just played endless rain  it was kino    what other fanmissions have you travel across rooftops of medieval buildings that tower over the streets
    its from the very end of the final cutscene but more specifically i cropped it from pic related which judging by the image bleeding through is from the interior box art of some version of the game
  skacky owes a lot of his style to melan most of both of their missions fit that bill
i cant change my controls for thief 2  send help
    additionally you have    bones ep1 the old quarter t2  thieves highway t2  the power of suggestion t2  augustines revenge tg  nobles  craftsmen t2  a job well done t2  behind closed doors t2    keep in mind that a few naysayers here think city missions are for brainlets
    thanks my dudes
  i can beat this mission in about 20 seconds lol
  rent free
  rent free  what did he mean by this s
hmmmm    what do you guys think too much open space outside and not sure what to do for it should i go full the sword and just halve it and make the perimeter walls high as fuck
  id say bring the perimeter walls in a good distance make them taller like the sword as you said and add a few simple buildings on the outside taller than the wall so the area looks a bit more lively no need to go crazy with detail some rectangles with pyramids on top and windows would do the job
  add a waterfountain and a pool to liven up the outside or something 
  make a massive garden maze
  very cool what fm is this from
  i bet you its a contest mission    taffing tease
  thats only for pr0n boards dummy
  get rid of the walls and have nothing but sky on all sides
  get rid of the walls how dost thou dare to speak such heresy might the builder strike thou for such words
hey sneaksies could ya give me a tip i forgot how two first games are played and ive just finished t3  and it had a creep option which allowed to walk very slowly but completely silent is there such a thing in the first two games can i walk silently even on marble floor without using moss crystals
  tdp has a speed toggle button tma has a separate sneak button called creep check the customize controls under option menu you need to press them when moving  no you are not silent when sneaking on marble however there is a technique called turtling rapidly press the walk forward button while holding the toggle speed/creep button try not to trigger the walking sound
    the trick is to stop before your movement triggers a step animation and therefore never makes a footstep sound
  its a sketch of a mission i might make as an anon in the last thread pointed out thief 1s typical building textures are incredibly garish which is good but i thought it would be fun to do something primarily using the games relatively few grey textures including some rarely utilized ones from the lost city not sure if ill end up doing anything with it
alright fags which one of you wants to test my fucking mission
  why id love to you cunt just pm schlock on ttlg
  sent 
  me me me i do i do
  whats ur ttlg or discord m8    get ready for a shitshow im pretty sure  already died from how terrible it was also made a lot of retarded mistakes lol
  you should totally keep working on it that room looks pretty rad
  nah im writing up my notes and recommendations in a word doc with screenshots and annotations and shit
  thanks i have a pastebin from a friend here  so ill get on those  yours tonight     also feel free to comment on the button behind the bed one friend said it was super hard to find and no clue but the others thought it was easy
  would you be interested in going through the submissions of the contest
  sure why not it could be a fun intermission and it would make sense as a part of what were doing given the theme

download the newdark version of calendras cistern  it adds colored lighting
  someone else posted it in another thread that wasnt me i use it as my desktop now
waiting 3 more days for these god damn missions to be released    can i make it bros im about to sperg out waiting for this shit
  yes and its called rgb and it is a thing now
  aldarith on ttlg    shall test
i havent installed fan missions in a long time i think i still have darkloader installed but apparently thats supposed to be shit now how do i into fan missions in current year i kinda want to see these anniversary missions
  newdarkloader or the builtin launcher fmsel
played fms religiously until about 2014  return  see this contest  see that cold deaths embrace and black frog finally came out  skacky and drk still havent delivered  im pretty fucking excited bros
idiot here  is there some kind of easy way to view objects without placing them in dromed      like an external object browser or viewer similar to the half life model viewer for hammer    i want to save time by seeing what im placing beforehand instead of all this experimentation
i have never played a single game in this series and i want to start with the first game should i bother with dark project or just play gold
  tdp feels more contained every mission has high quality even though the last two are often critisised for being linear in gold the new missions are pretty controversial and of varying quality on the other hand the new missions are also pretty important for fleshing out the plot a bit     id say play both
  no member on ttlg with that name bud
im at a loss i was certain that  s sound effect at 1352 was from thief but i cant find it in the files      start with normal then switch to gold gold has more missions but suffers from that yoyo effects where you might love certain missions and hate others like normal thief but even more with gold
  theres a fair number of newcomers this contest i wonder how many will keep at it
soul
  soulless
  is the sound from deadly shadows ive heard of many people ripping off the tds soundtrack online some of the shalebridge cradle tracks have even been used without permission in shitty indie horror games
  its cool to see haplo come back for this contest the community has definitely slowed down over the years but i hope it never quite goes away i could see things pick up if le corbeau releases an updated version of dromed with new features like quake/unreal units conversion    personally id love to make an fm someday since its my favourite game but in order to do it justice i want to get better as a designer first already done some work on other games
  i honestly dont know its been used in hiimdaisys persona 5s video too might just be a stock sound floating around the internet but it sounds thiefish
  ascobol then
  nobody    there must be a model viewer
  sent 
  let me guess even though the dark engine source code was acquired dromed still remains the same and nobody can update the program to give it basic features
  picture  did someone try to remake the godawful notkeeper compound in thiaf how would you even implement all those points of no return with access to such advanced controls and game mechanics
apparently zontiks new campaign will be out soon im curious to see if hell finally contain his autism and produce something as enjoyable as it is impressive or if hes taken soul tears keeper of infinity as a challenge and doubled down on it
ill just leave this right here
  love it
in nomine robot et glass et spiritus metal
  more like this
i make one new thing and people start spamming the thread with my works i think dominus stuff would be more appropriate for the games anniversary
  i wouldnt mind playing thief 3 again but it sure needs to be updated at least with kurshoks fish people and gamalls statues actually being able to hit the crouching garret ghost girl was a cutie pie no wonder the hammerite in your picture was so dead set on finding the hag and proving her existence
  
what is the best comedy mission
  i like bloodmist tower
i feel the way i did waiting for christmas morning as a kid cant fucking wait
sent  it it is a small boring maze with little challenge   you can finish it within 3 minutes   terrible just like my first t shirt   but i finished it i will do better next time  
happy anniversary  thief the dark project is 20 years old  wooooooooooooo  hip hip
  how we discovered thief stories  got it for free with a magazine big brother installed it skipped the tutorial attacked the front door right away got rekt said its shit and uninstalled it  came after him reinstalled it and had a blast    that moment when i got in the mansion and understood i was never meant to attack the front door
  fucking cool
  there is one for thief 2 i think if you cant find it through google or searching ttlg you should ask over there      newdark dromed has a ton of new features that olddark didnt have
stinkykitty made it in
    dont listen to the other anons yes it verges on the easy side but when it comes to thief fancontent you either have cryptic 90s adventure game hard or somewhat beatable if you waste more time than it is worth    t2x gets everything right as a fanmade game that is set between t12 yeah zaya is on the edgy side but she shuts her face for 95 of the time during gameplay so its fine theres some awesome stuff that no fm or om did before like moving train level detachable zombie limbs brothel level among other things    if you bother slogging through fms its definitely worth to check t2x out
  i wanna use those prototype sounds for a guard
  be me  be 14 or less  be browsing eidos demo disk goodness  click link to eidos webside and browse catalogue  click to thief website  immediately intrigued and terrified reminded of mcfarlene toys  ask mom to buy it right away  go to ebgames  buy trapezoid box  show mom game at home  what did i buy for my son  well im keeping it  ok
  ahh i am looking for something for thief w/gold
  this might have been the first thief thing i saw
  at least your mom actually cared about what game you played mine never did whenever i tried to talk to her about games shed go oh its another game where you walk in the street and shoot people its dumb and retarded so i dont care stay a child if you want
skacky gib black parade update before the years over pls
  the only interesting thing about the brothel level is that its built into official lore as its based around the documents one can find at shoalsgate people often neglect to mention that t2x includes one of the best hammerite missions ever made a question of knowledge
24 submissions with 27 missions total
oh shit taffer    is your body ready  is your body ready  is your body ready
  lets start with gort
  alright guess we wont have to worry at all about the accuracy of the fms release date this time theres quite a lof of them more than half of what weve played so far so depending on how much we want to focus on this this could be more than a little detour well see for now lets get started  its time to celebrate tdp and theres no better time for a clean install of the game that will replace those blasphemous banners with hammers to remind everyone who truly built this city
off to a good start on the anniversary contest fms this one is called the sound of a burrick in a room and is your standard city mission but still plays rather well
hope you guys enjoy my mission
jej
seeing the architecture in these other maps makes me feel like a fucking brainlet
dont fuck with skacky
  what happened
so i need more spooky customs that are a little more than just theres zombies in a cave like down in the bonehoard  did the contest have anything like rowenas curse where its a a mansion with thieving and secrets but also spooks or a better tomorrow where its stealth around custom monsters in a big thieving city
  catacombs of knoss  maybe madness of wolfgang handspiegel    i dont know about the rest havent played them yet
  also sauce
  someone on ttlg called the contest a failure of epic proportions because the missions werent released exactly at midnight even though it had been explained that they would be released at around 7am est
  lrn2saucenao  
  mage towers    how i loved like 9/10ths of it but fuck i had to cheat to beat it because i literally couldnt find the last rune or door or something i spent 4 hours on it
  the mission is actually pretty straightforward you go to an elemental tower complete a few jumping puzzles grab the key to the next tower then rinse and repeat until you get the final key that opens the door to the talisman
i never understood how people disliked mages tower but enjoyed bonehoard
  yo thats beautiful reminds me of harry potter and the philosophers stone for pc and ps1
  
    update    darkness walk with us is what you probably would like as well
  which one this one looks fun
  the whistling of the gears
never noticed before that the flow of water affects rope arrows
  do you think well ever get another thief game that isnt shit  is the current state of video gaming prohibitive to that  i honestly think that modern aaa companies are unable to produce games like thief anymore  look at the nutomb raider games its absolutely nothing like the originals hell the legends reboot trilogy is more similar
  fanmade ones yes from the commercial games industry no
  is it summer put a sitting area outside with some people standing around chairs and a rug laid out on the grass with some snacks on it like theyre enjoying a midsummer night by candlelight it could just be set dressing or you could use it for level progression somehow
  a friend lent me tomb raider 3 it came with a demo that had the assassins mission definitively an awkward mission for someone with no experience but i fell in love with it nonetheless took me a few days to get to the manor
  ive always called this skimming as it feels like sliding quietly across a floor like an unnatural ghost
  honestly the only developers i think could pull it off are arkane and io interactive and even then it probably wont be as good    even if eidos montreal actually gave a shit while developing thief 2014 it would likely still have the same problems that i have with their deus ex entries
  bloody screen    so real
is it just me or does thief 2 feel slower to move
  blood fx
  that looks like abosolute shit  i hope thats satire
  how we discovered thief stories  actually it was from /v/  back when it wasnt all shitposting and shittaste  along with the likes of deus ex vtmb and stalker
  brap
  if you look at the early versions of tdp you notice the explosion of the fire arrow is a gif i think the gas cloud can look good but it has to be of a lower resolution
so is thief magicpunk  how would you describe its aesthetic
  clockpunk
  thief 2 is slower they removed things like straferunning and jumping speed was capped
    le punkpunk maymay  you people ruin everything it has nothing to do with any sort of punk aesthetics  and the entire goddamn point of the world design was to pick the surrealistic stuff from jeanpierre jeunets films and the expressionist movies 30s and 40s then throw them into blender with medieval fantasy and served cold thief 2 is pretty much screams the city of lost children which was huge back then
  thats why i was asking anon  no need to get uppity   i appreciate the through response
  you know two weeks ago i had a lecture with students and we were talking about how daoism brings all sort of fluidity to chinese movies and nothing is ever certain and precise this being far east studies everyone was familiar with all the concepts needed to easily grasp it  and then we were watching a documentry did by british for british about said fluidity or rather the 70 minutes of struggle of bunch of brits that were trying to force everything to a mold drawer and compartment all with proper labels and laughing our asses at their futile effort to cram something that exists as uncrammable into a precisely welldefined box  and here you are asking which of punk aesthetics thief is while in your mind the punk suffix exists as completely meaningless and not bringing anything to the table but also as a shortcut and excuse to try to cram something original into preexisting pattern  dont do that please  just dont  thinking in labels is what computers are good at and it would be wasteful to take a human being reduce it to the capacity of a machine that can be manufactured for about 150 bucks because that means you are not competitive and thus should extinct
well imo my experience with the missions in this contest is off to a great start    playing alphabetically by archive name  the sound of a burrick first    there are so many comfy places to hide and visit  think ill have a bath 
  i cant believe im saying this about a post on 4chan  inb4 4channel  but thats some good advice i will take your advice to heart   it does seems like sometimes we do take the easy way out and confine our thoughts to these predefined molds and do nothing but limit ourselves by it
  you have until march 1st to vote plenty of time methinks
  and we have only one month to try them all 25 diveded by 4 comes down to 625 missions each week overdrive  this is my first time playing a gort mission    i dislike the converging patrol routes of the citizens and the guards it becomes very difficult to predict your window of opportunity the place with the bowman in front of the keeper sign is a frustrating choke point people just keep coming when you knock someone out and a guard spots the body they get riled up start to move faster and have improved senses this fm is quite punishing when you make a mistake no way you are going to outrun those guards or fend them off good luck finding a spot where you can knock them all out and if you get spotted in the mages area a message pops up saying there are mages roaming the street as long as you manage to survive that place with a bowman that shoots 5 arrows at the same time wizards with magic swords great the mages area looks so nice the magic stuff is amazing apart from locking yourself in the room of statues if you dont have the bag of powder but the placement of guards and wizards makes sneaking so difficult    this fm is very rigid in steps you have to take in the beginning i got to the northside warehouse pushed a barrel towards the stone wall at that point i climbed various barrels to access the back alley and tried to mantle wasnt allowed to i had to use a gas mine to knock out the guards i tried to look for a house i could enter but didnt find one those three guards will not attack you until you pull out a weapon as opposed to the guards on the street who try to kill you on sight after you get the poker and walk outside the door at the northside warehouse opens    this fm remixes oms assassins the opera from song of the caverns and the warehouse part of shipping and receiving it is huge and you have to take breaks 4 hours and i am still going    i do not like this
  around lets say 12 weeks
dont miss out on the upward spiral it came out the same day as the contest but wasnt part of it its pretty short and cool and it has some peculiar read autistic stylistic elements especially in the readables
  not him but if it wasnt for your smt2 gif i wouldnt discovered his post thanks
  damn i kinda liked the mobility of gold
what do you think bros im not a fan of the upstairs bit but i genuinely dont know what to do
  buying games on steam that are available on gog  also tds is fun if you get the mod i forget the name that removes a lot of loading screens and changes the hud
  oh good someone else who doesnt like it either i just outright gave up on it when i got to the choke point you mentioned i agree with everything you mentioned about the patrol routes and the certain steps required to play this fm i will add that architecture is a little too simple for my taste and i dont like how much the opera house in this level matches the one from song of the caverns one thing i found annoying was the abundance of marble flooring and lack of moss arrows
  its easier for me to buy on steam since i can use some card of my country gog requires paypal or credit card and i have neither
thief 1 and 2 are probably close to perfect games its been a fun 20 years glad to see the fan mission making community is still active
  if you look at the opera from song of the caverns you can also find simplistic architecture the single texture hallways in the basement raouls secret room gort made use of the textures and there are some very nice rooms there is a reference to tdp here considering the anniversary i dont mind that it matches in textures or did you mean the architecture in general  the opera in song of the caverns was elaborate lot of hallways and some secret passageways the opera by gort is very small 3 levels two of them consist of a hallway with some seats for guests no secret passageways no readables about the place apart from the scroll carried by someone outdoors certain doors cant be opened giving me the impression the rest of the opera part of the world is closed off the marble floors and the riled up guards make traversing this place difficult    it looks similar but it does not play similar
  what is the number of the latest official version of newdark now
  126
  it would need a completely devoted developers who are ready to trow all modern game design to trashcan against the will of motherfucking squareenix so no i dont think so
  to be honest you should pirate the gog games the only ones who get money are square enix and they have as much to do with the original thief as they have with deus ex

  yeah i wont lie its been exhausting so far   the pieces that make up this mission dont go together well i enjoyed the mixing of some classic thief areas even when they look a lot like the originals its what the player is supposed to do in those old places and what happens there that brings something new to the formula but theres something off about both the objectives and the challenge    the player must follow a linear set path theres nothing else to do beside what youre supposed to do and only by doing that youll be able to proceed the only time this is done subtly is with the mages guild entrance it doesnt work as well with the rest of these transitions the one you missed is the worst offender a man appears and then attacks the three guards only if youve read a scroll about how hell do that  the emptiness of some areas make the mission look more like a maze than anything where a wrong turn will just lead you to a dead end is it the intended purpose you know what i think of this kind of stuff otherwise dont show me a door if you dont want me to open it pic related is quite symbolic in that regard    as for the difficulty this fm is meant to be challenging but sneaking past entire platoons of mutant guards isnt interesting enough to justify giving up on thiefs explorative side just like with pixelhunt fms exaggerating one side always makes the whole mission feel wrong even when a fm focuses on sneaking over exploration or viceversa the other element should still be there to support the main one in this case some of the stuff that makes this fm more challenging than others like the guards that cant be blackjacked instead of blending with the setting and mood takes over to put the player to the test im not against the introduction of new maybe weird elements like regular guards that can go berserk or the unpredictable patrol routes but instead of being one of this fms strenghts they feel out of place

should i get lunar 1 and 2 on sega cd or ps1 i do think the openings are far better on ps1 due to the anime
  youre gonna hear a lot of here we go again from the /vr/ community op just a heads up    general consensus is that you can go with either version of lunar 1 but you should stick to scd for lunar 2 because the ps1 version is really washed out on the anime cutscenes and a lot of the battles were made pisseasyborgan is the biggest offender i always remember
i dont know about you but the anime cutscenes in the psx games are compressed low res have an ugly style and are generally unpleasant compared to the sprite art cutscenes in the original
  play the sega cd versions with the working designs changes patched out rhdn has a thread for them
  ps1 version of lunar sega cd version of eternal blue      lunar was always piss easy working designs fuck with difficulty in a lot of their games
    the working designs versions are harder than the originals this doesnt amount to much given they are jrpgs but it means lunar 2 is a bit harder than is average for a game in the genre
can i use the wiimote to point with the sega cd emulator in this one
op here  i was thinking in the back of my head to do lunar 1 on ps1 and lunar 2 on scd seems like the majority of this thread agrees can you guys elaborate a bit more on why the scd version is better for 2     nigger i aint doing that im fine with playing the originals
  nigger i aint doing that im fine with playing the originals  well lets just hope you like vic irelands arbitrary gameplay changes like having lunar 2s equivalent of jp be spendable on saving
  the original has animated sprite art cutscenes they look really nice the remake has very compressed anime cutscenes with a decidedly budget appearance    the original has compressed redbook audio soundtrack it sounds muddy but you can make out everything fine the remake has a playstation soundchip port of the sega saturn music it is sounds very weak as playstation chip music usually does    the original has the sort of gritty color palette youd expect of the genesis while the remake is much more colorful this one is entirely preference but i like the grainy look of the sega better also the sprites are cuter in the original once again this is an opinion    those are just aesthetics though heres the big one all the dungeons are massively cut down and simplified in the remake the remake just has short hallways instead of real dungeons since you grow attached to the character by having them around seeing their animations and the like you simply wont get the same sort of attachment you are supposed to get to lucia plus the whole excitement of getting through a dungeon before your mana and health resources run out simply isnt there lunar 2 has above average dungeon design for the genre and the remake does not have that
  the unworking designs version is definitely better
  sega all the way ps1 if youre a retardo
  there are dated jokes in there but the antiireland crowd love to stir up shit every chance they get because its true shit the wd translation is not bad but if you like the games enough it is worth playing them with the patches in the future just to see the differences      as  points out theyre jrpgs so how/why does it matter
  theyre jrpgs so how/why does it matter  in the case of lunar 2 the changes pointlessly increase the grind factor and introduce retarded stuff like using skill points used to power up magic as currency for saving thats right  saving the added difficulty doesnt make the game more fun the only time i know that wds difficulty tweaks actually improved a game is alundra where the enemies were made to deal more damage but also take more from you so it sped up clearing crowds of mooks while also making the game more challenging in a good way
  there are random mobs that can onehit you  the difficulty is alright in the sega cd version because you can save scum instantly every step of the map but in the psx the difficulty becomes a problem because saving takes several seconds
  sega cd version is harder    sega cd version is alright    so which is it and omg you have to take a few seconds to saveshock and horror    i do agree with  that the save system in that was stupid but apparently someone realized it as well because when was it used again
  where the enemies were made to deal more damage but also take more from you  bullshit    
  americans will defend that with git gud
  alundras hardest aspects are not its combat
  its just tedious then not hard got it
  look man do you actually wanna play any of these games or are you just gonna sit around talking trash and acting sassy we already gave you some suggestions take them as you will and go play some damn games
  hes not wrong though some puzzles in alundra are total bullshit because of the precision they need
  get both
  how do you upload a patch to your sega cd  oh wait youre a digicuck emunigger
  cry more collectorcuck emulation is objectively superior to original hardware
those designs are very sadamotoish
are the ps1 versions good at least i have those and i dont mind if the scd versions are better i just want something thats good
  can you not recommend retarded advice there is no benefit to procuring redundant copies
  what youd just patch the iso then burn a copy of the patched iso and play that in your console
  t sped
  they arent bad sssc actually improves on the original in many ways but you definitely wont understand why many people love eternal blue so much if you only play the playstation remake
  illusion woods in the original a forest with trees that have illusory passages in them which you navigate through
    illusion woods in the remake a generic hedge maze where a guy moves some bushes so you can go through     something happened to gamearts inbetween the originals and their remakes everything is inexplicably lazier and shittier then they went on to make grandia and lunar dragon song which were awful i have no idea what went wrong but its sad      this is true but unless you save scummed constantly the cost of it is never a problem
  pic
  its never a problem only if youre a teenager in highschool with lots of free time to burn constantly getting killed and losing hours of progress every time
  this triggers the collectors
the patrician choice
  my point was that the cost to save vs how much magic xp you get per battle is negligible unless youre saving every five minutes for no good reason youll never even notice the cost of it    as for overall difficulty that shouldnt be happening unless youre terrible at games the original two lunars are some of the few jrpgs i consider to have almost perfectly tuned difficulty by exploring each new area and dungeon fully but not stopping to grind youll be just leveled up enough that the next boss is just barely beatable      this unironically has an even worse translation than the wd ones and i have a massive hate boner for vics stupid jokes
  as long as the playstation version isnt an unplayable pos ill give it a pass although your words make me want to try out eternal blue on the sega just to see the differences maybe i might do that if i like lunar 2 enough    the fanbase seems to at least agree that all versions of lunar 2 are better than dragon song
  its not an unplayable piece of shit its just nowhere near as good
  working designs  the originals  kek
are the saturn versions worth playing or are they basically just 11 ports of the scd version
  the saturn games are exactly the same as the playstation games except the music sounds slightly better because they were originally designed for the system
  your reading comprehension sucks hardcore eh
do you prefer older ones with simple controls and arcade feel that were simplified but easy to pick up or more technical games that tried to bring in as much complexity and realism as the hardware limitations allowed
i like mine slow plodding with as much control over detail as possible pic related
it is also worth noting that /vr/ football team is preparing for the participation in 2019 4chan winter cup weve been competing against other boards in simulated soccer matches since 2013 and we hope to put up some fight in upcoming season too as always wed love to gather opinions and suggestions coming from board denizens regarding players and music we should use in the next tourney if you have a few minutes to spare please place your vote in following poll        if you are not sure what is this event about please read the description on the top of the poll thanks in advance for your feedback

i like arcadestyle ones that have fun twoplayer modes and thats it baseball stars and tecmo bowl are my favorites arch rivals is fun even if its pretty simplistic ken griffey jr presents major league baseball was pretty good from what ive played i remember one of the wayne gretzkys 3d hockey games being fun too    i havent really tried sports games on the genesis yet but mutant league hockey looks promising    whats the consensus on nes soccer games
the easier to pick up and play and less realistic the better  windjammers  football frenzy  neo turf masters  2020 super baseball   rushing heroes  i havent actually played it but i watched dirty pigskin on a stream and that seamed like my type of game  and fuck ea sports they are the most boring but sell millions for some reason
mfw bicycle captcha      dos roms should be a player
  this is the only sports game i enjoy neo turf masters looks fun but i dont have it atm
  sorry wrong image i meant this
  whats the consensus on nes soccer games  soccer is simple and fun for two players but not good at all for single player  ai is horrible and you can win 300 by exploiting the same patterns  kunio kun soccer league is dynamic and entertaining but has a very bad case of flickering when too many players line up on the screen
i think most people here are going to prefer arcadey unrealistic sports games i like baseball simulator 1000 nba jam nhl open ice and tecmo bowl the nes ice hockey and golf are also both a lot of fun i dont think realistic sports game fans are necessarily fans of video games as much as they are fans of sports but i could be wrong
  we should get an oregon trail rep put the wagon in as the goaltender
  okay thanks
    play sensible soccer if you want the best retro 816 bit soccer imo
  hey i had that game never was good at it  sensible soccer is more fun than any soccer game that came after it game imo

  winning eleven
iss64 is pure footie goodness
ice hockey and blades of steel for nes
this series is awesome they also made arcade cabs for some of these
fun arcadey games tend to have be better to pick up nowadays  iss virtua tennis nba jam pro evo sensible soccer but this is just a rule of thumb and certainly not always the case many ea sports games around the turn of the millenial are superb and great to play to this day
mostly nes games ice hockeyall fat guys blades of steel baseballeven if it seems rigged after you lead for a couple innings super dodgeball punch out and a few others i cant think of other than that nfl 2k2 for dreamcast2k5 is better but not retro and nhl 9496 on genesis oh and ready 2 rumble
  also i guess to answer the question i didnt really start caring about realism til consoles started becoming powerful enough to pull it off well i didnt look for anything realistic in the 2d era
  a few of my favorites based off of real sports are ice hockey for nes nhl 9396 on genesis nba jam arch rivals super dodge ball nfl quarterback club nfl blitz nhl hitz i like fantasy sports better mutant league stuff windjammers i also enjoy some golf games too hot shots neo turf masters various mario golf
  also forgot the rbi baseball series arcade version is great fun for 2 players i dont care about baseball irl but there are roster update hacks for people who do
im still fond of tecmo super bowl i guess i prefer arcade styled games much more than simulation styled ones
has anyone ever played hybrid heaven before    just finished the game and i thought it was pretty fun for an wrestler rpg
i did i remember being slow and clunky i know if you use the expansion pak and enable highres mode its slower i do recall being intrigued by the combat system though you got through it start to finish any tips
loved that level when you run around an arena with the two huge beasts
what a bizarre little gem of a game   basically vagrant story mixed with a resident evil/parasite evesque biological horror atmosphere
  stick with one type of attack through the entire games    my first run through i focused on kick attacks i think ill godhand the second playthrough    always keep 2 pace distance away from enemies and youll breeze through the game try to use combos more often to get an extra special attack in fighting 5 bosses after the last save point is pretty brutal but since i never used any of my items
yeah i had it as a kid and was a bit confused by it it was boring but cool looking so i kept going with it im pretty sure i got through it but who knows i dont remember one bit of the story
i played and finished it a few years ago  its a pretty interesting dungeon crawler with the only downside being some platforming/action segments that still are very few most of the game is going through dungeons and fighting monsters mibs and other freaks and the battle system is actually pretty addictive and fun managing stamina while figuring out the best move set when you start doing suplex it gets super fun  i remember the final boss being fairly tough it was like fighting against terminator   i plan to replay it sometime i tried the multiplayer and it was also fun
got it many years ago when i bought a bunch of 64 games off a buddy played it for 2 mins and turned it off gave it another shot last year and couldnt stop playing it beat it an loved it will replay again one of these days
soplaying bg2 again havent played it in 10 years so i dont remember much besides it being fun    i dont think i had anomen in my party last time hes such a wellwritten character hes a total assfull of himselfjust easy and fun to dislike     im playing the game blind which is a blast so i had anomen tell his dad that he would let the law handle his sisters deathbut when i went to the gov building they said they wouldnt do shit so i caved and told anomen lets kill whoever we need to kill to get revenge and im a good cavalier     the scene when anomen kills the innocent daughterjust wow that was brutal i almost went back to a previous save because it was so awfuland i lost 2 reputationbut it was so intense i was like fuck itlets keep this as is and move on    then its time for his entry to being a knight and the motherfucker is denied i did reload here because i said something that made him attack me after reloading i calmed him down but now hes chaotic neutral    i was going to trade him out for another partysince hes a stain on my otherwise cliche white knight paladin gamebut im keeping him hes a bitter asshole and i hope i get to hear some odd dialogue or isolated ramblings from him while we roam around    anyone else fuck around with anomen yeahhes a fuckerbut he seems like the type that would fit in here cringeinducing at timesbut someone that cracks me up at how interesting he is
  likethis pic is how i picture anomen after being denied knighthood
beamdog is a guilty of a number of different crimes here are the major ones    1 the enhanced editions are essentially a collection of free mods that had existed for nearly twenty years beamdog gathered them all up slapped enhanced edition on it and resold it as a new product theres very very little in the enhanced editions that wasnt already out there and most of it is stuff you dont want like obnoxious character outlines    2 the games didnt sell so well and the originals were still far outselling them even twenty years after their release so beamdog had every digital distributor stop selling the originals and only sell the enhanced edition if you want to buy a digital copy of the originals now theyre bundled into the enhanced edition now these scumbags can claim sales from people just wanting to buy the originals as their own    3 the infamous 600 bugs on launch the game is still riddled with bugs as even a perfunctory glance over their forums show but the fact that it took nearly two years for them to get a game that had been working fine for 20 years to reach playability after launch is telling of their wild incompetence    4 this is where we get to the ones that really piss people off beamdog couldnt just remaster the game they had to fuck with the content too new dialogue for existing npcs like jaheira viconia safana kivan et cetera was written in to make the characters more progressive and leftist friendly beamdog shills will argue that adding content isnt changing content xddd but it is when the new content changes the core personalities of the existing characters this is in addition to adding a slew of their own lgbt hitherto there were none in baldurs gate npcs all flooded with op attributes and magic items to encourage people to play them despite their cancer    5 siege of motherfucking dragonspear
    you sound like a massive homosexual
  he actually has two different romance paths for female protagonists depending on whether he passes knighthood or doesnt when he goes chaotic neutral hes kinda all over the place because hes not above killing aerie and keldorn a good reason not to keep him around cliche white knight paladins but his failed knighthood romance makes him something like a more downtoearth character that loses his naivete some people like him that way    anyway if you want a true and proper knight in a party of stereotypical knights and you already have keldorn get mazzy
  based
  ive played his char both ways kept till the end its a good addition as an alternative to vic
clerics are for pussies just sleep it off you fag
out of nowhere aerie tried to console him for not becoming a knight and anomen started attacking her     fortunately he didnt rage where he was out of my control so i just clicked them away from eachother    little things like this are so awesome
  were it not for the order the gods would surely smite op for his sins
  i was surprised and delighted when chatting to the upper class hooker in government district with both valygar and viconia i think viconias constant insults toward him shes basically calling him gay are actually a crude form of flirtation stuff like this is why bg2 remains to this day the best crpg of all time
  ha nice ive never had them in a party together ill have to try that
man this game sucks
zoomers will defend this trainwreck unironically
its the x6 of the snes games  late janky and loads of fun
  other way around my dude hating on x3 is youtubebaby tier
  oh look its this thread again  
its an x game goes without saying that it sucks    or maybe theyre actually ok games i simply cant find the fun in them compared to classic mm theyre just too demanding    basically op you can dislike something without being a dick about it
  demanding  theyre easier than the classic series you fuck unless youre too retarded to learn how to wall dash jump
  i found the first two x games pretty fun 3 seems like complete shit in comparison to me aka not fun    as for your comparison to the classic mm i dont get that cause megaman x in general is much easier than the old games imo youre just way more powerful in x
  i dislike vertical stages in classic so what did x do add wall jumps thus ramping up the usage of vertical sections hammering away on the jump button to avoid rising and falling lava boss attacks or whatever sucks hammering the dash button also sucks but that was before i was aware i was being an idiot and should have instead learned where and when to dash      there are sections in even the early x games that come off as insanely difficult compared to anything in the classic games im remembering some slowly moving platform you have to cling to but not too rapidly else youre gonna be spiked and a long spike walled vertical shaft you have to ascend riding incredibly slow moving snails with shit shooting at you from all sides    also you start off with half health and take double damage until you find body armor classic youre full powered and on an even playing field from the start searching around for stuff to bring you up to where you should be sucks yeah powerups are optional you can win the game without them its purely psychological that you suck without them and should want to get them and that worked on me to the detriment of my enjoyment    classic games on the whole are far and away easier to me and i dont see that changing
  interesting perspective all i know is i die all the fucking time in classic megaman far less so in x
   dislike vertical stages in classic so what did x do add wall jumps thus ramping up the usage of vertical sections hammering away on the jump button to avoid rising and falling lava boss attacks or whatever sucks hammering the dash button also sucks but that was before i was aware i was being an idiot and should have instead learned where and when to dash  do do you just hate pressing buttons    classic youre full powered and on an even playing field from the start    in classic you had bosses that could kill you from contact damage in like 3 hits in addition to have basically no mobility options    the fact that you have a full health bar doesnt mean shit
  i dont see all the hate for it i only ever played x1 and x2 as a kid since my local video shops never had x3 around 2000 i played it on an emu and loved it    can anyone who genuinely hates it please tell me why with minimal memes
pick a notorious good game  say it sucks  trolled everyone xd
    the controls are stiff
what is the best magaman game to you faggots then
  2 or 3      same controls as 1 and 2
  then why do i have no problem playing 1 and 2 but in 3 it seems like its hard just to do basic maneuvers
  possibly because x3 wasnt developed by capcom whose internal mm team were hard at work on 32bit console development it was outsourced to the devs of mm gb 1/3/4/5
    based and redpilled
  i dont care how much a game sucks  i play to beat the game completely  i play to win
  no idea what youre talking about x3 was built using x2 as a base just like x2 was built using x1 as a base
mm7 is unironically the best snes mega man game
  imma show you best magaman nigga

how do you pronounce polygonal  like  paulegonul  or  puhliguhnul
  palegahnul  yall
  paulegonul anyways wasnt that picture proven to be deceptive it clearly has alot of bumpmapping just by the looks of it and in motion the differences may be apparent
poe  lidge   own  al
  anyways wasnt that picture proven to be deceptive it clearly has alot of bumpmapping just by the looks of it and in motion the differences may be apparent  op here its deceptive because theyre taking the third model and just adding or subtracting polygons to it the image doesnt account for artistry or the ability to use polygons well i just used it because its kind of related to the question and its guaranteed replies around here
its the 2nd one usually when theres a y in the middle of a word it wont have the e sound unless its a poly type word that can exist with the prefix like polyunsaturated
  without the prefix and i mean the e sound like in free    i need to go to bed now i think
  this is what i always assumed and how ive always pronounced it but everyone ive ever heard use the word says it the other way
  its a word that doesnt have much use outside the realm of graphic design so it could be one of those cases where even scholars wouldnt necessarily correct you either way
  thats such a retarded image it always makes me cringe a little
      hear it for yourself    everyone else is wrong wrong wrong
  based
  yeah if you just basically read enough and listen to enough discourse its hard to see those kinds of word any other way although i understand how it could seem the other way it just doesnt work that well with the long e sound once you start agglutinating adjectival/adverbial endings to it i know that sounds like a haughty statement but i dont mean it that way
  puhligunnul has a better sounding than paulygoneul    do you pronounce ocarina with an oh or an aw
  
  its ockareena like doc ock unfortunately nintendo chose to katakanize it with オ which probably added to the general pool of misinformation
  polygonaall
  i like how this image thinks it is disproving diminishing returns only for its own example at the bottom to show barely any improvement from 20000 compared to 200 and 2000 other than a slight impression of bump mapping

  video games today dont look much better than video games in 2006 so clearly no its not deceptive
  thats the normal way of spelling english words in katakana  if it were written アカリナ that would imply that the english word is pronounced ackareena with an a sound like in the word act  for example pocket monster is written ポケットモンスター as パケットモンスター would make it packet monster
  thats a weird way to pronounce it anon  what are you a dumb faggot
  its another episode of english language being retarded  any language where you arent sure how to read properly things upon looking on the text is shittier by default
  if you had said 2010 that would have been more appropriate even so ps3 and 360 held us back for quite some time
  its ockareena like doc ock   nintendo chose to katakanize it with オ which probably added to the general pool of misinformation  katakanize    thats the normal way of spelling english words in katakana    ocarina is an italian word you school rejects the japanese transliteration is not only fine it is on fucking point
  paul  nah  puh  nah  pol as in politics   polly gone al/el/ul
  excellent post  just what youd expect from a bastard language created by inbred retards

  to be honest the flat shading lighting model used i deceptive in its own right in the top row the 3 to the right would look identical on a smooth shaded lighting model without the need for the extra polygons    polygons are performance killers though and most games heavily limit them on screen but during the modeling phase they create ultra high detail models using sculpting tools like zbrush and then they render that extra detail out as textures bump/normal/parallax/displacement mapping then they reduce down the model polycount as much as they can without noticeably losing detail
  dingdong diddly based
  this is bait right you just cant be this fucking stupid for real
    its a weebs swing their dicks around about who understands japanese better episode    i can guarantee you nintendo wasnt going for an authentic transliteration of the italian pronunciation source japs are rubes and the vast majority of their loanwords are from english because their cultural boner for us is 10x harder than ours is for them the pocket monsters example just makes my argument better as it illustrates how they cant even effectively choose which syllable makes for the better phoneme in their own writing system    if you criticize the word katakanize without accepting its linguistic efficacy youre a closedminded retard
  thats either one of the most purposefully misleading or one of the absolute stupidest images ever the fourth slot should be 10 characters at 6000 not one returns only diminish when used poorly    also anyone confused by the pronunciation is fucking retarded
   pocket monsters example just makes my argument better as it illustrates how they cant even effectively choose which syllable makes for the better phoneme in their own writing system    not him but that happens all the time translating languages with significantly different alphabets or structures in general i think i agree with you though katakanizing something is a mouthful to say but makes sense
  i suppose if you were some sort of weird ass redneck you might pronounce it packet manster
  also anyone confused by the pronunciation is fucking retarded  t pronounces it paulegonul
  nintendo invented the word ocarina
you pronounce it kwads
polygonal
πολύγωνο    take this to /lit/
english german and french really are retarded languages most of the time pronunciation is up for interpretation    if you spoke spanish or japanese like me this wouldnt be a problem at all
  t native english speaker
   but german pronounciation is pretty much what its written its french and english that are trying to up each other whos gonna have more retarded pronounciation and reading rules apparently it never occured to either to make things sensible rather than retarded in such crucial tool as a fucking language they use
  diminishing returns are a thing but the op makes it seem like theres no point whatsoever in increasing the polygon count

polygon is phonetic or at least paulegon so why wouldnt the adjective form follow the same pronunciation

hi guys    i was curious if you could help me in the wake or nintendo filing suit against my favorite emulation sites loveroms and loveretro it seems that nintendo roms are difficult to come by i came here with the hope that you might be able to suggest some websites that are currently offering nintendo roms i appreciate your responses in advance    best  chuck
  i dont emulate i believe nintendo deserves to be paid in full for the consistent quality products that they put out     such as the nintendo labo best 80 on cardboard ive ever spent
nice try nintendo fbi
  if you deserved to know youd already know

  i tried to help you by giving you a link back to your age appropriate subreddit but it was rejected as spam curious though since you appreciate all the responses you got in advance why didnt you just use those its not like theres been a shortage of faggots shilling their favorite rom sites any time in recent history

not that obscure but very strange im talking about the gameboy original accessories    especially pic related just how reliable and legit was that questionable pocket sonar 
  not obscure but ive always wanted this
  there is something so satisfying about handling those huge n64 dev carts
gradius limited edition jacket which i almost purchased but was way too small
  man i actually had this but the killer was that without the analog stick and the c stick youre very limited in what games you can actually play
  its almost as if it was made with only those few games and accessories in mind or something    look for it on ebay etc  100 bucks and up  wew
i regret not sending away for the moogle watch from the little pamphlet included with snes ff3 was only like 10
    that controller wasnt made for gamecube games it was made to play gba/gbc/gb games
  vic viper though motherfucker
  sure
  pretty sure
  because this pad is made game boy player
  is it actually useful for anything else but gameboy like snes
  i mean you can also play games that dont require the gc analog sticks
  on early wii with emulator is good
  it was marketed that way in north america but in japan i think it was marketed as a gamecube controller
  but its really quite useless as a gc controller without any analogs    what were the nips thinking
  that a good gb player controller was a good idea what were you thinking you werent were you
this here is damn unique   not only one of the hardest games there is but also one of the best of all time
  you really have trouble following a conversation dont you    hint i originally posted  then  came along with the claim that marketing in japan was aimed at gamecube games which i happen to believe is false hence my clearly sarcastic reply     its a gb player controller end of
  you really have trouble distinguishing anonymous from anonymous  not the sharpest tool in the shed
    that seems unnecessary
  good for that megamancollection too
ok so its true there isnt a single good game for this overpriced amiga wannabe    but how many quirky rough gems are there stuff like d i mean what does the 3dos library have to offer thats truly original
metal gear 3
road rash gex star control ii the need for speed wolfenstein 3d policenauts and lemmings those are all pretty good whether or not theres better versions out there im not considering them
  ok so its true there isnt a single good game for this overpriced amiga wannabe  i dont even like the 3do that much but damn  lets not say things we cant take back
  wing commander 3  return fire
captain quasar  super street fighter 2 turbo great remade ost too
  dr hauzer  tripd  blade force  scramble cobra  guardian wars  luciennes quest  seal of the pharaoh  shockwave 2  iron angel of the apocalpyse  iron angel of the apocalpyse returns  cyberdillo
  street fighter    what does the 3dos library have to offer thats truly original
  powers kingdom is a genuinely curious little jap srpg and im not sure if that ever appeared on any other platform at least outside of japan     return fire got a ps port after the 3do died but was an original and fun 2 player title at the time     the 3do version of star control 2 is technically not an original game but enhanced over the basic pc version immensely and a fantastic title

thanks to anon who linked to russian site  its great

  play regular game
bleh
  succ posting
i finished the game but cant kill those 20 golden dragons on arena theyre just destroying my blasters and depleting health really fast
guys i cant figure out how to get good at homm3
  watch 11 hour games of mekick winning with only a ballista at 200
now that was a hard fight i checked stats of these dragons and apparently they have energy damage just like my blasters this explains why my armor and resistances were worthless to them
screenlets have to move the camera  lmao    
  yes energy damage is an actual type in mm6 even things like power liches get energy damage and there is no resistance to it in fights like the dragons i tend to run into a corner like you did and then it is a race of blasters and avoiding/healing damage
  meh wouldnt spank
  what thefuck kind of face is that  i need to play that game
  these portraits have simple animations and look goofy at times
  i do love how status conditions give you the most goofy faces
    i swear that guys face is the definition of exploitable
  cove is not even top tier or most beginner friendly rampart ivor castle valeska or dungeon shakti or even wystan fortress are king for easy starts and necro / conflux / dungeon / rampart are probably the top tier overall cove is strong not strong but still not all the way at the top  if you play in a setting where you bet some of your starting gold to choose a specific faction instead of relying on luck you should be paid to have to play tower cove will not be the most expensive to pick at all neither will it usually be the first ban
  cutest monster  not picking the superior nagas  son i am disappoint
  dungeon  nah too expensive
  too expensive  not particularly relevant on jebus cross and many other rich multiplayer templates nobody plays mp on 200 because its just rng rolls shakti puts you to a great start in hota lorelei and hags rush is a very good way to start as well overlords are great in general    in single player 200 starts i would hesitate to call cove op either hota at least removed the need to ban the factions that were op in sod even though they still remain strong
free my nigga galthran
what is the worst campaign mission and why is it this one
  the one i hated the most as a kid was surprise griffin ambush  haha another surprise griffin ambush  oh you thought we were out of griffin ambushes didnt you
  i think the christian campaign in ab is the worst since there is basically no tolerance for error and you pretty much have to know where the scripted events are
  any problems can be solved with bloodlust and prayer its not that bad its just bothersome to setup
  redpill me on bloodlust and prayer am i underrating these spells
  prayer is basically superior to haste if its lategame because its like a couple of spells in one and water is overall better than air in most single player maps    idk what this guy means about bloodlust i like frenzy if im planning on never getting hit
  no but fire spells is pretty terrible at killing things outside of armageddon and undeads turned out to be immune to all the debuffs which is what fire is really really good at in homm3
  i rate air above water but i do admit that that ranking is contingent on what level 5 spells i get i do agree that haste isnt really that useful though i would say moreso endgame than early game but ive also actually been rating water below fire as well so i might have to rethink my beliefs    berserk blind slayer and sacrifice are all very useful though i also think bloodlust is arguably better than prayer since ar  all i might be wrong though as i said i usually dont even take water magic
related to campaigns why are there so many missions where youre against opponents who not only have more towns than you but also have oneway teleporters to your towns my main may be completely unstoppable but having to town portal back so often turns those missions into a slog that i just cant be bothered to go through
  you dont need your main to defend your towns just get castle and buy a bunch of whatever creature has the highest health
  i rate water above air because water has bless prayer and teleport which are all superb air has haste and dimension door in combat water is far superior the only problem is that youre nearly guaranteed to get haste but bless is less common as t1 and prayer and teleport are somewhat uncommon yeah dimension door allows all kinds of fuckery but its rare
  chain lightning and destroy undead are also really nice for random stacks as well as disrupting ray    bless is kind of bad bloodlust is better on average i do agree teleport is nice but kind of redundant in the late game since you have generally fast/flying creatures even moreso with mass haste you didnt mention clone which is the only water spell i would really consider to be a major potential game changer though having it on expert level doesnt really convey much of an advantage imo
what is this cant teleport hydras behind castle walls shit
  you need advanced level i think
  well i guess its kind of situational bless would be better on lower tier creatures with larger damage ranges while bloodlust is on average better on higher tiers though again might just be my bias since i have played very little taking water magic
  bless and bloodlust give the same damage increase 30 in the best case scenario which is that the bloodlusted stack has higher attack than the defending one  in every other case bless gives you a better bonus bless also works with ranged units unlike bloodlust and lust is a fire spell  now this is assuming i remember my spell and damage multipliers correctly which i may not    try it prayer alone is absolutely fantastic nearly as good a speed increase as haste combined with defense and attack bonuses
reinstall mm6 after taking a few months break  install grayface patch  decide to cheat and grab the fly scroll from the side of the bank  fly hotkeys arent working  check patch readme no details about changing the hotkey  uninstall and reinstall game without patch  fly hotkeys work  wat this has never happened to me before anyone know what could be going on
  i think its bound to mouse wheel at least thats the case with my game i dont remember if i set that up myself or if it was like that by default
  theres a little tool with his patch mm6controlsexe you can set buttons as you like maybe patch changed default keys dunno
    after trying it a few more times i got it to work with the patch so i tried it a few more times to try and pinpoint exactly why it had worked turns out if you use the fly scroll on a knight it wont work im not sure if how the game works natively but i had no clue if i use the scroll on any other character it will work i made a team of four knights and none of them were able to fly despite the scroll activating and being visible in the sidebar so yeah thats apparently a thing
  oh lel fly/water walking drain mana for every second you spend in the air/on water but i didnt know scrolls need that too
  bless vs bloodlust depends on the damage range of the unit tbh therefore bless would most often be better on low tiers and weaker on higher tiers and no bloodlust is a higher potential damage increase since its flat 6 attack while bless on expert is max native damage 1 but yeah situational really    honestly might explore water magic more yeah i just dont see why i would in normal play bank on getting prayer when i see several more useful spells both in battle and on field in air and fire
new to the thread but i think that waters biggest draw is the potential to cast expert dispel and cure and block whatever horrible shit another person might throw at your army    but i actually prefer air because i do think that mass haste wins games its the most powerful and flexible level 1 spell for creeping and i stand by the assertion that you win or lose most games by creeping better than your opponents do
  yeah dispel and cure are good but imo its not necessarily worth getting on expert since there are few mass spells that are that bad or lack other counters like slow i mean im sure there are many players out there that are much better than me and that do very well using water magic but for me it pretty much always feels like a waste of a slot
  but i actually prefer air because i do think that mass haste wins games its the most powerful and flexible level 1 spell for creeping and i stand by the assertion that you win or lose most games by creeping better than your opponents do  of course it is my entire point about water is that its better in those longterm games and drawnout campaigns like unleashing the bloodthirsty because in such a setup planning to get expert prayer is going to be better in the longterm along with all of the other necessary spells    but obviously expert haste is fantastic in a quicker game
  just finished homm ii rolands campaign choosing the crown scenario instead of the gauntlet gather troops on the eight map to carry over to the final battle shit was intense and ive lost and took back the middle towns in the badlands and the desert twice dimension door allowed me to steadily grind the ai down and defeat them piecemeal before facing archibald up top had to restore twice when roland got in a castle with pants down do recommend
    yes it does drain mana even with a scroll if you have a 4x knight party and need to fly a wind master is required
  what is the worst campaign mission  for me its fall of sandro not because its hard but because it feels redundant i firmly believe that union shouldve been the culmination of the campaign also the map itself was uglylooking which annoyed me even further likewise the entire specter of power campaign felt cheap and lackluster so ill include them in that category as well
  tfw arena music gets intense and youre low on hp/sp and theres still a badass monster wanting to kill you
  i cant hear the music while shooting with blasters like a machine gun
  rland campaign  you disgust me
  he doesnt play both campaigns back to back  pleb
  ubisoftno  posts inferno   if ubisoft did anything right it has to be inferno they definitely made them more exciting to play in 5 and its not just gating and very decent units but special demon lord abilities like consume corpse or having the ability to add aoe damage to consume corpse from the sorcery tree and so on
  i mean inferno in homm3 lets you demon farm
  i am not sure if i like going from kreegans to imp faction sore demon hole edition  it just felt like a terrible admittance that the kreegans where in the end terribly outgunned without their primary hive and primary queen
  when i first saw my friends playing homm3 and noticing nagas i instantly knew which faction i want to play  the one that has something so great  took me two years to finally start playing other factions since tower is just meh but man the nagas
  but man the nagas  no love for medusas then also its kinda funny that these snek waifus come from two factions that canonically hate each other
  nagas  can tank everything  no retal  medusas  mediocre archers with 4 shots
  mediocre archers with 4 shots  rude also ammo cards are a thing      basilisk and medusa playing rockpaperscissors  surprisingly wholesome
  medusas  mediocre  when they have no melee penalty and stone gaze  and by the time you actually get to have fights that last more than 4 rounds you have medusa queens anyways and medusa queens have 8 shots how many battles arent decided in 8 rounds
  since when do statues talk
  not him but the medusas are pretty mediocre for reasons that have nothing to do with their small ammo capacity just compared to the mages another not so great tier 4 shooter they have 2 less attack 1 more defense 1 less average base damage same health and speed and cost marginally less they do not have the magical support ability nor the avoiding of obstacle penalties and thats ignoring the awesome nonshooters that are available with the t4 creatures can you really say theyre as good as vampires/vls sworsman/crusaders the superfast pegasai/silver pegasai hell even the 60 hp ogre magi are probably better with that pure tanking ability
ammo for the evil eyes
  yea but thats like almost it they dont have much going for them as much as i dont like 6 even there they had the most interesting mechanics for example summoning a giant demonic worm that could swallow a whole stack and damage it every turn and to free it the enemy had to attack it you could also summon a gateway in your zone of control of your town meaning you could open a portal for your army to appear anywhere in your territory and they wouldnt lose movement    imps are awesome
  silly pit lord thats not how wings work also disciples 2 has arguably the bestlooking demons from all the games ive ever played
when you arent paying proper attention and you accidentally take intelligence on a magic hero  its also your main  goddamnit i am an idiot
  intelligence is great though i mean its not top top tier the way schools wisdom offense and armorer are but i often try to get it for magic heroes if you want to spam high level spells like resurrect elemental summoning lots of fly/dimension door/town portal around the map several times in a turn youre going to need hundreds of spell points and intelligence really helps out
  its a waste of a slot i have like 400 spell points now and there is never a situation where i would need that much its not the worst pick ever but its still kind of a waste of a slot
  intelligence is great and helped me win that last scenario of the first campaign i resurrected plenty of times my troops in order to beat that horde of steadwick defenders
  some times maps turn into a slugfest where you need to cast thunderbolt every  single  turn
  its great on a might hero but it feels like kind of a waste on a magic hero to me oh well guess ill have better turn economy since ill basically never have to stop to refresh mana lmao
  there will be fairly long battles where you will need plenty of spell points its not useless as eagle eye
  so youve got a knowledge of at least 20 and you havent won the game yet with a hero that big what the fuck are you doing win the game already
  intelligence is really good on xl maps against multiple ais where you end up going on monthslong campaigns something like unleashing the bloodthirsty if the map creator is fond of puzzle fights where you simply have to outlast your opponent with having higher mana sustain intelligence is the way to go intelligence also really helps you spam dimension door / town portal / fly which are all really strong    of all the magicenhancing skills that arent related to elemental magic mastery intelligence is the best i mean id pick it any day over sorcery eagle eye mysticism and scholar    its not an ideal skill in your typical mp match but its absolutely excellent in sp especially given how much the ai is susceptible to cheese and tactics such as leave only one unit in the enemy camp blinded you now have an infinite amount of free turns where only you can act lasting as long as you have mana for reblinding you can use this to resurrect your entire fallen army or simply just setup a certain kill on the enemy hero to ensure his artifacts are yours    this doesnt happen against another human the most attrition of this sort you are allowed to do in most matches is engaging in resurrection / implosion wars but thats not that common
  was playing campaign so i had it from before also was actually like 300 and some but whatever
hey you three anons who are interested in those pointless concept maps im making  just a quick update   i completely reworked the central island it used to look like this  and i think the end result looks pretty good my idea was that only fortress would have access to water walk spell thats what the shrine at the topleft of the image is for and can use it to kite any enemies trying to take over their dwellings or to get to the obelisk in case the win condition of the map is to build the grail structure   so what do you anons think
  thats a definite improvement over the old one well done  the two mountains on the left side of it look out of place but thats probably because you arent done with the area  also would fortress build roads they negate the massive native terrain movement advantage
does anyone else have trouble finishing maps when youve clearly won but you just have to finish off the last few enemies
  not in mp or single scenarios but whenever i play a campaign i have to autistically maximize my heroes as much as possible
this game stops being comfy when you start playing jebus with timer
  game stops being comfy when you make it sooper serious  breaking news
  well done  thanks my man  the two mountains on the left side of it look out of place but thats probably because you arent done with the area  youre correct i first need to figure out how to create another major zone somewhat inspired by ysgith from thronebreaker before joining these areas together and filling out the rest of the map  also would fortress build roads they negate the massive native terrain movement advantage  i imagined that there would be one main road that connects the castle and the village as well as leading to the exit of the swamp this sort of makes sense from a worldbuilding standpoint since any nonnatives entering the swamp to trade would get lost and end up as food for hydras wyverns basilisks serpent flies trolls carnivorous plants and probably even frogs however everything not on the main path should be hard to get to unless youre a native which is further emphasized by those shallows that only fortress faction can use to outmaneuver the invaders as long as you have enough mana i suppose
  whenever i play a campaign i have to autistically maximize my heroes as much as possible  yep i have the same problem
  sometimes i even spend like a month just looking for and buying heroes with good spells if its a campaign where you are limited in terms of mage guilds
  sometimes i even spend like a month just looking for and buying heroes with good spells if its a campaign where you are limited in terms of mage guilds  okay you have me beat there  i just try to visit every single stat boosting object and almost universally take experience over gold
  i dont even know why i do it i know rationally that there is no campaign in the game that is hard enough to justify doing this
  its perfectionism/ocd
  thats funny because my life otherwise is a complete mess haha
  help yourself read  to get an idea of what youre facing    book in pic related is about cognitivebehavioral therapy a treatment for ocd mentioned in the wikipedia article the book has a chapter on perfectionism link to pdf     i drink tea from melissa for the calming effect mixed with st johns wort for mood elevation you can try those too see if they work for you im still trying them out
  kek wasnt expecting advice on treating perfectionism in the homm thread thanks though friendo i think it might have been causing me to avoid starting projects
its a large map full of backtrack for key tents    go jump a bridge if you make those you dirty ape
  s a large map full of backtrack for key tents  inferno tier
  ive seen a similar post at /v/ is it a virus or just 4channel advertising campaign
how would you fix inferno
  inferno isnt that bad
  all inferno units are now resistant to immune to fire damage including magog splash damage  high level inferno mage guilds will always have armageddon
  because the ai is so retarded it wouldnt be a fun challenge otherwise
  congratulations you just completely broke balance
  demon rez on partial casualty stacks
  balance is for fags asymmetry ftw
  horrible idea as well    having even more banned shit is surely exactly what this game needs
base gogs way too fucking slow for towns only shooter
funnily enough gomunguls just started playing an inferno game on panic  
  im watching swamp clash right now  
  homm isnt for serious tournament play its for casual fun with friends casual fun with friends only thrives on broken shit
  games arent fun unless you make them unbalanced  chess is more fun than connect four
  fuck off gay frog poster
  making any one faction that strong is a sure way to make the game boring part of why its such a good game is that it is fairly wellbalanced for its genre and therefore a skilled and creative player can win in spite of handicaps
yfw homm3 allows for imbalance in multiplayer with its unique free market balancing as in bidding for towns
  making one faction that strong means that even weak players can have a decent time
  how about just practicing and getting better at the game instead of just shitting all over it and making one faction retardedly strong necro in vanilla is bad enough already
what did inferno get in hota  magogs can target empty hexes with fireballs oh wait necropolis got that too  devils are slightly cheaper/more growth to indicate their shit tier  did i miss anything
  level 2 starting heroes got buffed across the board so calh became a really good inmeta starting hero  also devils arent shit tier they just dont win level 7 vs level 7 contests but the nonretal on a superfast unit is great  inferno is actually really good at taking utopias a handful of archdevils can be downright abusive they just have a rough early game and their heroes arent exactly winners but calh and ignatius can make do  some buffs to their build order to make it smoother were also given out but i cant remember what exactly  really tower got arguably bigger buffs than inferno a drastic build order fix and is still less favored in the competitive circles because their only good starter is solmyr who suffers on maps without wells and they dont benefit from the level 2 buffs simply because they rely horribly on their t1 and their t2 is shit lorelei wystan calh tyraxor are all meta in hota  piquedram never will be
  also its really disingenuous to compare lich buffs to magog buffs simply because magogs are available much earlier and successful necros generally base their strategy on vampire lord expansion due to lifesteal and not particularly on liches  buffed magogs set you up to win games liches dont assembling cloak of the undead king is a win more mechanic of sorts simply because lategame necro is mostly unstoppable anyway
  high level inferno mage guilds will always have armageddon    thats too much but i think that all units should have 50 fire defense
  arent vampire lords banned
  in hwrules for sod yes not in hota but hota did nerf necropolis in numerous ways to bring it in line a wellspun necromancy machine is still the best lategame you can get but its harder to get there
  looks like gomunguls has the grail in his starting zone
  bans vampire upgrade
  what are you a wight supremacist
this screen is awesome    games nowadays sucks cocks  because they wouldnt include such a coolness
  imps pit fiends and demons no longer have a upgraded unit and instead get more of the benefits straight from the get go  figure out who thought it was a good idea for demoniacs to be 90 scholar focused and having joke heroes like the fireball guy    give them a possible lategame strat other than demon farming because its not that great even if a demon death stack is amazing
  depends on your strategy i sometimes go for a hero with an intelligence trait as the main whenever that hero levels i will always try to that boost that trait i would keep the bulk of my army garrisoned in important towns while i take my main hero with a small stack fast units on a guerrila campaign against aicontrolled heroes towns and wandering monsters using dimension door and flying i can get across the map very quickly and attak poorly defended towns weak stacks and sometimes strong stacks using summon elementals and aoe spells ill either destroy the enemy armies completely or at least reduce their numbers through attrition in the case of the later i would run away
  good premise but why would you leave your army garrisoned when another hero could be using it to fight
  probably the player in question isnt good at reinforcing towns in a more active way and hates losing them to an enemy main randomly wandering in from beyond an uncharted land or portal and causing a massive oh shit moment as you trade away all your resources to muster a defense that you obviously neglected the whole game
  how would you fix inferno  add more demon waifus
  unironically this for a faction styled on devils from christian folklore the lack of breedable succs is fucking incomprehensible what were the devs thinking
  the lack of breedable succs is fucking incomprehensible  well mm had succubi but they werent present in any of the og homm games not even in text if im not mistaken ubi was the first to add them in homm v also xana best girl
  iirc xerons mom is referred to as a succubus when its mentioned that she was killed by the heroes
  xeron was like 7 years old
first scenario of foolhardy waywardness  why is this so hard
  because it is the last campaign as long as you got the shield before attacking the fortress city the rest of it isnt too obnoxious just slow
who thought it was a good idea to have enemies with instantkill abilities in mm7 in 6 you can at the least gain day of protection and get unholy amounts of protection against it  but in mm7 its fucking minotaurs and medusas walking between critical areas to traverse
  phwoosh  phwoosh  dong  dong  three dee oh
  yes i beat it now but you basically have to get lucky and hope the ai unlocks the quest guard which imo is stupid
  mm7 has this its even better  protection from magicbody magic costs 20 spell points grants entire party immunity to attackeffects that cause poisoning disease stoning paralysis and weakness the spell will negate one such attack per skill point  grandmaster the spell also grants immunity to deathcausing attack effects
  it is  but to even get it you need to pick a side do 2 promotion quests invest 54 skillpoints into body  minotaurs are not annoying lategame minotaurs are annoying because master water magic among other skills are in nighon and minotaurs are sorta easy to kill
you have to train to get level    is this the worst fucking idea in the history of video games  like fighting with monsters isnt enough of training for you level up
  it really isnt that bad  it mostly works because you clear a dungeon turn in a few quests sit on a literal dragons hoard of gold   and then you hit the gym  realize you want to pump it all into body building  and then realize only god  sleep is capable of healing that body
  gaining experience but not knowing how to apply it until trained  there is nothing wrong with this    you are probably just whining because it is early and you dont like spending gold other than getting spells you really wont need gold for much else anyway if you are really low on gold constantly you can hire a duper and merchant to both sell things for more and buy for less training and travel are also considered buying and merchant skill applies
  it works very well in valkyria chronicles
  or the vogel exile games
why is there so much shit in the foolhardy waywardness maps you cant get to theres no shipyard fly dimension or waterwalk so you cant get to any of the sea objects and even one of the marletto towers in the first map are they just trolling
  are they just trolling  yes
  consider these features to be decoration
not being an expert of eagle eye
  more like chocolate eye
is gauldoth halfdead the stupidest retard in might and magic or just an incharacter nutjob  eats bugs in a forest until getting btfo for trying eat a chicken  escapes a lynching and founds a kingdom  travels to some quasiplane to free his evil master who condemned him to his weird half dead bug eating existence and then hands him the kingship  allies with remnants of the unplayable the force that wants to destroy everything everywhere all the time  gets betrayed by the unplayable  surprise your evil master wants to do the same thing the unplayable do except it turns out hes like the michael jackson of necromancers  betray your master with the help of the unplayable  
they really know how to party    what did he mean by this
  his brain is half dead  imagine living with only one half side of a brain
  to be fair they did just shit tank the dominant power in antagrich at the outset of mm7 plus archadbald had usurped useless virgin king vilmar and let sandro out of lich jail so they probably did have some bitchin parties
  how did sandro fool everybody without having brain anymore then
icymi the elves converted to islam en masse after the reckoning and thats a good thing
  once you push 200 you should know how to party  otherwise you are a boring person
  nah winston boragus is way dumber and were not even going to talk about isabel
  i think either of the two retards who thought hey lets throw these doomsday weapons at each other and see what happens and blew up the whole fucking planet are by far the dumbest
  its looking great i love that troll bridge and how you hide its flag im not fond of the use of lucid pools but ive never been a fan of magical terrains in the first place
  winston boragus  what exactly did he do wrong
  dance macabre    the new world computing chaps were big fans of 2000ad
  not taking the festival of life fucking seriously when faced with a patricidal psychopath as chief contender  probably i didnt nominate winston
  he did take it seriously he just didnt win i really dont see what he could have done differently here
  its looking great  thanks anon  i love that troll bridge and how you hide its flag  yeah that was a flash of inspiration on my part before i was sort of stuck trying and continuously failing to make the central island look decent  im not fond of the use of lucid pools but ive never been a fan of magical terrains in the first place  i understand  the cyan of the lucid pools doesnt really blend well with the darker water terrain however this was done to simulate the depth of water as well as to offer a unique playing field for the defenders as ive said before the fortress would be the only faction to have access to water walk thus enabling them to bypass stronger heroes and gank the weaker heroes trying to steal dwellings or get to the obelisk check pic the enemy player could theoretically traverse through these shallows as well with the summon boat spell but that would be so inefficient that theyre essentially barred from using them
  he has fooled them before rotting his brain
boragus was always gonna lose its just the kind of character he is doesnt mean he isnt a retard though
    i was actually more talking about how he destroys the angelic alliance to prove the loyalty of yog and the latters appetite for destruction because why wouldnt you completely lose a ridonculously powerful artifact to get another second rate commander when you already have loads
ywn have solmyrs chiseled physique  tfw no 8pack
  i forgot about that    lol
  its risky to leave your town undefended or minimally defended a small garrison is just going to get slaughtered youll also lose income and unit production    with a small raiding party i can gauge the strength and abilities of the enemy without risking most of my troops    i generally only move my main army once i know about the enemys locations/strength and a large portion of the map or if i have to get through a heavily guarded location    some enemy heroes have devasting spells like chain lightning armaggedon or death ripple on top of have a very large army in this case even if you win against the enemy youll lose a lot of your troops better to just whittle them down with guerrila attacks before they reach your main army
  name one good inferno hero
  octavia  not main material obvs but one thats always worth hiring
  calh in hota makes for an effective starter due to an acrosstheboard buff to level 2 heroes and his archery  specialty fit in nicely because new magogs are actually really good  then theres ignatius tactics  a lot of expendable cannon fodder at level 1 is actually a big deal makes them good at expanding  pyre is born with logistics so shes good by default and a starting ballista is actually a great boon esp if you can bait the ai into wasting their turn on hitting it  demoniacs arent amazing but there are plenty of factions with overall mediocre heroes that youre better off exchanging for a superior tavern hero if/when the opportunity arises  castle or tower for example suffer from the same problem
  not the guy youre responding to but    its risky to leave your town undefended or minimally defended a small garrison is just going to get slaughtered youll also lose income and unit production  not really the income loss of a day or two is minimal and as long as youre doing a good job recruiting and you dont lose the town on day seven to have your opponent recruit you wont lose manpower and while hes running around taking your town you take his    with a small raiding party i can gauge the strength and abilities of the enemy without risking most of my troops  but you do risk something infinitely more valuable an expensive high level hero by having him sit around with a small force that might get completely defeated      some enemy heroes have devasting spells like chain lightning armaggedon or death ripple on top of have a very large army in this case even if you win against the enemy youll lose a lot of your troops better to just whittle them down with guerrila attacks before they reach your main army  i think youll find that in almost all cases youll lose more than you gain by having guerilla attacks with small forces against a large force with a high level hero
does anyone else save scum before looting an artifact/relicdropping enemy in mm7 in my case and reloading until you    a get an artifcat/relic   b get an artifact/relic that you like    i didnt do that when i first played through but in subsequent plays fuck it right also found it interesting that the game eventually stops giving you artifacts forget where i read that but i definitely seems to be the case
  also found it interesting that the game eventually stops giving you artifacts  yeah the games do that but i dont know what the logic is behind it because its not like the games are hard so having more artifacts wouldnt make you considerably more overpowered than you already are
  i didnt reload and kinda regret it because theres indeed a limit for artifacts to spawn and i had 7 out 13 that were useless to me
  if i am playing with full cheese and kill the emerald isle dragon then sure savescumming and multilooting for a good artifact and there arent many seems fine because the whole point is to break the game in a normal run just take what you can get
  loled
  the prerenders for mm6 n 7 are so great
  holy shit  this picture reminded me that i havent finished my map yet
  the magic resistance set with a yingyang logo on it placed on a yingyang island
  i forgot about that how far are you from finishing it
  need to put more resources and trees because its too empty
  and underground
biggest jerk in mm7     this guy makes you feel all cool for winning the tournament then later when you meet him in tatalia he treats you like a toddler and basically calls you a peasant bitch you live in a troll infested swamp      jerks in other games fine too
  objectively the biggest jerk is kastore he is also the best character
    kastore was still murked by kilgore and gaylus homoerotic sword play but i want to disqualify them for being too easy  gaylu still knew better  contenders  sandro genocide for unlimited power  gavin magnus immortal totalitarian reactionary asshole who failed adequately prepare bracada to counter any threat at any point over literal centuries gremlins are a mengelean mockery the natural order still considered good  lord haart consistent asshole since the succ wars  (((slicker silvertongue)))
  ywn be so chad you desing topless naga tanks as your top unit  kastore out chadded archibald thats pretty damn good for an elf actually now that i think about it his side was supposed to be the canon victors of mm7 so it literally took death threats from reeeeing fans to stop him thats not something many villains can boast
  oh man im an nwc dev i got btfo so hard that now im writing characters named lucifer kreegan because now im literally shaking i just cant even  mm7 doesnt have an ending as the heavenly forge clearly doesnt resume possibly the good ending happens but instead the gate network says lol nope and shits out escaton for mop up
  slicker silvertongue    and the worst part of it is that you cant kill him because he falls into a lava pit and still lives while you cant damage him
  what did he mean by this
  absolutely based
  underground should be a rooster looking to the left chad eagle vs virgin rooster make it happen
  you still can but you need to nuke him from range before he can walk out to the platform you can also savescum until he finds a pattern back inside
  if you include homm4 gavin magnus almost certainly wins this category
  bbut in hota
  only one hero on this list benefits specifically from a hotaonly change and thats calh everyone else on the list has always been considered a good inferno hero sod or not    i know you probably froth at the mouth whenever you see someone enjoying heroes of badwrongfun iii the ruination of resistance but at least attempt to read the posts youre reacting to
    ayden and ash 1 bloodlust is pretty good and so is int specialization  pyre ballistais always good  ignatius tactics  imps specialization    its just that they are not complete monsters like gunnar kyrre dessa or lord mulich
  ayden  oh yeah i forgot him him elleshar and andra are really good in huge sp maps as pictured here   ash  not a fan here on the other hand bloodlust is not a priority buff for me and the bonus attack is fairly miniscule and eagle eye is horrible  its just that they are not complete monsters like gunnar kyrre dessa or lord mulich  exactly right as inferno get a generic barbarian or overlord from the tavern if at all possible your first hero pick should focus on boosting your early game hence why ignatius is popular here    ive even seen fiona bonus dogs for a stronger army and scouting means you can plan out early movement a little better and rashka 1 speed for efreeti is good because theyre legitimately a good unit and if my philosophy is already to turn my starting main inferno hero into a secondary scholar can save you movement points
    what about marius/nymus
  sure why not both boost demon farming to an extent and have solid secondary skills they dont do much in the early game
  demons are not that great units but its certainly doable if you can rush pit fiends  i would argue nymus is worse than marius since one gets the demons to farm the other only get stats for a good level 5 unit
  him elleshar and andra are really good in huge sp maps  i tried testing how well the intelligence bonus scales in the map editor  at level 59 aka 99999999 exp points a hero with 99 knowledge has 990 spell points a hero with expert intelligence 1980 and a hero with expert intelligence and the intelligence speciality has a whooping 5400 spell points you could cast anywhere between 180 and 220 implosions before youd run out of mana however i cant remember ever having a hero that was over level 40 and had over 55 knowledge even with artifacts as well as ever being a situation where i needed to cast so many spells
  also disciples 2 has arguably the bestlooking demons from all the games ive ever played  amen
  amen  i mean disciples overal unit design is top notch despite the concept art for it being way too extra at times but legions really took the cake there also solid unit composition though id like if you included 2 incubi instead of modeuses
  and i just saw the gamespot logo ignore the retarded unit composition criticism ive just wrote here
    these magnificent bastards literally take up half the screen and those even arent bosses just ordinary units you can get pit lords from hommv look incredibly cheap and derivative in comparison
  these magnificent bastards literally take up half the screen and those even arent bosses just ordinary units you can get  and tiamats are arguably the biggest chads of them all look at this fucker  he is as wide as he is tall hell in combat when you put two of them on the sides fo the party you can barely see the unit in the back row  pit lords from hommv look incredibly cheap and derivative in comparison  well the reversed wings are a pretty nice touch at least otherwise theyre just bogstandard dinosaur looking demons with armor
jfc make a disciples thread
  as well as ever being a situation where i needed to cast so many spells  this is useful mostly for abusing the shit out of travel spells and winning fights in some toughasballs scenarios where your strategy might very well be to run the enemy ai out of mana before you can truly go on the offensive  also you dont necessarily need to strive for max level scaling  intelligence is already going to give a substantial mp bonus to a level 20 hero with an appropriate knowledge level  point is spellcasting is extremely abusive against ai and intelligence lets you get away with more of said abuse intelligence also synergizes well with stuff like mana vortex    it also works better on maps without wells
  they all basically the same boring horns  batwings shit though i would like demons to visually differ from one another  look at goetia demons or dnd fiends for example
  jfc make a disciples thread  im afraid that the game is too niche to warrant a separate thread we brought up disciples because we discussed homms arguably bland demon design so its not like this is offtopic anyways      point is spellcasting is extremely abusive against ai and intelligence lets you get away with more of said abuse intelligence also synergizes well with stuff like mana vortex  fair enough  intelligence logistics navigation offence defense and most other specializations that give you a 5 increase on a particular skill except first aid tent fuck you are all really good in their own way
  they all basically the same boring horns  batwings shit though  theres much more to that and visuals are heavily accompanied by fluff  for example you have silly almost comical mischievous imps   lascivious succubi and incubi whose facial expressions emanate delight and pleasure   immobile gargoyles who once they lived thoughtlessly followed merciless orders and after eternity of suffering turned into statues hardened as their hearts   molochs with giant tongues who gorge themselves upon the souls like their biblical counterpart to whom the human sacrifices were made  threeheaded abyssal devil with paralyzing ability is very reminiscent of satan frozen into the icy lake of cocytus in dantes divine comedy
if anything a gargantuan imposing beast with batwings and many a face is as close as you can get to the epitome of a demon image
    those are some wonderful illustrations theyre from divine comedy right
  dunno i always had a hard time remembering which demon upgrade is what and all legion units looked like samefacy redbrown mess to me
  yep
  come on they are pretty memorable imho
  maybe im not seeing a clear hierarchy because of unremarkable names of support unit tree too many demondevillord variations  same with undead dragons somethingdrakes whateverwyrms cant even remember them without looking it up have no problems with any other unit tree in the game
  demonologist turn into incubus  abyssal devil is over a demonlord  beast is an improvement over moloch  i dunno mang it feels like they picked name at random like moloch is a god and yet its just a tier 3 unit just like a hag or a demonologist or a anti paladin    disciples games have fun units tree but they feel really random at time i think disciples 3 has psychopompes but theyre placed randomly in the tech tree
   turn into incubus  what exactly is the problem here both of the upgrades are demonic beings  abyssal devil is over a demonlord  well 5th level upgrades were added only in the sequel previously the demon dord was the top dog canonically though abyssals overlords and tiamaths are greater demons aligning with the wonder kid against bethy  beast is an improvement over moloch  do you want to argue about biblical power levels after all the beast is a pretty transparent allusion to you well know who    what i could agree with you is that angels sucking ass compared to mortal defenders of the faith or holy avengers is pretty silly
  what exactly is the problem here both of the upgrades are demonic beings  what no demonologists are people versed in the science of demonology incubus are downright demons  canonically though abyssals overlords and tiamaths are greater demons  ha if its explained in game then its fine  the beast is a pretty transparent allusion to you well know who  yeah my landlords very scary  im pissed off that moloch whos a god in his own religion is placed below the beast through i read it as beast rather than the beast
you fucking faggots just turned this into a disciples thread  muh too niche  posts a dozen and a half posts of filler and fan art  start a fucking disciples thread faggots
  demonologists are people versed in the science of demonology incubus are downright demons  i meant pandemoneus and incubus which demonologist upgrades to
  you fucking faggots just turned this into a disciples thread  no we didnt  we were using disciples ii to show how uninspired homms demon design is
  please do not use such words this is advertiser friendly website  also kys
  ha right my bad      it usually bothers me how demonic towns are usually just normal town with black buildings and red windows but in that case it looks pretty fine organic and all
  better to discuss a similar to homm game than getting on the page 10
  similar to homm game  aside from being turnbased fantasy strategies they have nothing in common
  you have fun with them in the similar way
  toжe c вeгaчa
  technically yes but im spending more time here for a while
  it usually bothers me how demonic towns are usually just normal town with black buildings and red windows but in that case it looks pretty fine organic and all  but that makes them look zergish personally i loved what homm v did with the town screen  it sort of reminded me of dis from dantes inferno

  wanna meet that pok
  that game had beautiful cities but it was so hard that i ended up hating everything related to it
  that game had beautiful cities  arguably the best in the entire franchise shame that the developers of v were the only one that made an effort and were willing to invest resources into creating 3d town screens      but it was so hard that i ended up hating everything related to it  what about v was hard for you
  beautiful haven  what about v was hard for you  everything simply put i felt like the ai always knew where i was and the moment was army was weakened enough it would come at me in a straight line and instantly murder me i absolutely hated v and it ruined my interest in the franchise after iii and iv who were fun
  in iv ai can feel your grandmaster stealth heroes even without any scouting skill
  but it never went at me immediately  actually i think i always managed to have fun in iv maybe the game is easier but v fuuuuck i just got fucking owned again and again no matter how hard i try
just a small update for those of you interested in those concept maps of mine    i only need to figure out how to make the part at the bottomleft corner of the screen and the map is as good as done then all of you can dl it and expand on it as you wish any of you willing to give feedback on the current look of the concept
have a rich well developed designed and beloved world  destroy it    who the fuck thought its a good idea
trying to get a 2nd of darkness weapon of any kind in mm7
  it had reached peak murderhobo anon  only way to get more murderhobo is to nuke it and plunder the ruins while the low level adventures fuck off
  but cant you as a player simply find out if the enemy is weakened or not from the thieves guild that ones not exactly cheating even if fell the ai simply knows i think 5 had one of the better ai in the series and the user made ai mod makes it better i think
  doubt so i played several skirmishes and it always feel like the ai just waits for me to be weakened and then turns into an icbm directed toward me knowing exactly where i am
  i feel this way about g maps in hota where you better find them before they find you and weasel your way into their castles  does anyone know if necropolis shroud of darkness still royally fuck ai in hota
how do i gitgud at this game homm 3 the fucking ai kicks my ass in most of the games/campaign and i tried out some games online and got my ass handed to me by some eastern euros nice guys
  protips    focus on unit dwellings and unit hiring at first  start fighting with creatures as soon as possible to get exp and resources  never took exp from chests  start with might heroes and invest in mage guild later its too expensive better focus on unit recruitment  if you can afford it at day 1 start with two heroes to get resources faster  always have few heroes to make unit supply and getting from windmills chain
  watch gomungulstv russian or theknownworld speaks english on twitchtv
  wait shroud of darkness actually works against ai the map object too
    cheers
  never took exp from chests  except when you have all creature dwellings and a solid economy
  something  forgot to mention is always use the fastest unit possible for extra movement points also make sure you take the best skills possible
  i think it depends on a map in regular singleplayer maps your economy is never good enough but for these pvp jebus templates gold is not really a problem
  if you have all the dwellings you want and are making thousands per day there is no reason to really take the gold every time there is a limit to how many units you can purchase per week anyway
  not him but by the time you have all the dwellings and a capitol you also probably have a main hero who is at least level 89 and the amount of xp you can get from a chest is trifling
  so at that point any potential stat increase is more valuable than a bit of gold
  oh yes i also forgot to write    always leave slow units in town as a defensedwarves dendroids golems walking deads   at first dont upgrade all unit dwellings upgrade only those one who gives abilities to creatures  dont upgrade to magogs but if you have use magogs only as a defense  its better to divide ranged units into two squads that will not stand next to each other
  could probably mention that some unit dwellings really arent worth it but i guess he will figure that out quickly on his own
  all inferno units are now monster girls
  all inferno units are now monster girls  this man understands
ogre mage was supposed to be in necrotown    wtf
  are there new rules for pvp theyre using necromancy and diplomacy
  i wonder how far they where into their rooster before they finalized their towns  i guess they also realized their rooster was too dude focused and ditched a lot of player races from might and magic for grabbing a few sprites fresh of the 3d model photo copy magic software    i mean mm7 have the necromancer faction with goblins liches and wraiths and rocks plaguing the overworld  i would image they reworked tower at the least twice to make it more monster focused  i would also like to add one of the bad things about homm5 is that its a very dude focused game in terms of units heroes 3 and 4 did a lot of work to weed that out since monster dudes in armor do not mesh well once you need 78 slots and 57 towns
  i havent seen a game where necro wasnt allowed diplo on the other hand  thats new
monthly succ wars check
      and i forgot about one important thing    always try to movie horizontal/vertical diagonal movements cost more move points
    nice 404
requires the newest hota    
  diagonal move still costs less than two straight moves you probably meant to say always pick items horizontally
  oh no no no no no no
how good is age of wonders 3  is it a decent homm replacement  what are the best homm clones
  replaces one of the original factions  its shit
what are the best homm5 maps with the expansion  that game is actually pretty comfy but i feel like it doesnt have tons of content    also what about homm7   ive given up playing it each time after like 1 hour into the campaign does it ever get better should i push through
  how good is age of wonders 3 is it a decent homm replacement  i havent played through the previous games dont judge me pls but i can say i had fun playing through it for some time  however my ocd prevented me from completely enjoying the game and sort of soured the latter campaign missions if you dont have issues with your hero not being completely upgraded and not wanting to conquer everything on the map before completing the objectives despite the fact you couldve finished the game long time ago id definitely say the game is worth a shot   it also has a randommap generator so you can play it indefinitely go watch totalbiscuits goodnight sweet prince review of it to get a general feel of the game       what are the best homm clones  since you already brought up age of wonders i presume that you already played the older games older kings bounty games are sort of heroeslike as far as i understand and were made by the same person who was in charge for the first three homm games although you command only one hero disciples are somewhat similar as they focus on heroes and building up your army but in a different way you arent interested in having more units but having a few hightier units that can wreck shit
  ubihomms are shit  do not play them
sure valla
  but are there redeeming factors  i played the shit of homm2 to 5
  no redeeming factors
  best ui  mm8 ui was shit
which one is better mm7 or mm6 
  mm6 is generally better  better graphics  better story  better designed
  and fack
  mm6 has quests  and a sorta terrible melee/magic balance because there is a lot of deceptive mechanics like running being bad for your attack speed so you need to hold shift or what recovery reduction on skills do since they are really really strong  the jank is simply something you get used to and the game is so long you adapt to several layers of jank and clear a lot of dungeons and do a lot of quests    mm7 have promotion quests instead of quests and some terrible decisions regarding the new class setup i mean you have thief and rangercould be same class and ranger vs archer which end up being weird and one set of gm skills per class where some are technically mandatorybody gm and others are just to stop bumping your skills to 40x to get 100 repair/identify or things like gm merchant being sorta useless because you should be filthy rich to even get into a second faction  for all its gameplay improvements they still added a lot of jank because the dev cycle got cut short so the game is shorter and you end up in this situation where you need stuff like master water/air to even do anything for a causal playtrough and it just feels sour
  not really most towns 1 week recruitment is around the same 28000 cost as a town with a capital generates unless youre in the odd position of having 1 and only 1 town with few external dwellings youll be in a position to turn extra gold into troops
hota map barren lands  month 14 week 1  only met 4 out of 7 enemies  barely explored half of map    ive seen some shit  xh maps are fucking evil
  mm7 really suffered from 3dos time pressure  if devs could have 1 more year the game would excellent
      theres two specific exceptions to the gold over xp rule that id ever bother following   1 if the xp from the chest will tip me over to level up an important magic school faster especially if i picked someone like grindan  a very fine starter hero expert slow a turn or two faster might get me more dividends than a bonus dwelling or a citadel in those cases  2 if im levelling up a new primary hero or if im levelling up a very specific mook hero  for example getting jeddite or alamar to become a potent secondary with decent spell power to mop up stacks that arent worth my time but more importantly to get them expert scholar so that they can teach resurrection to my main hero     so yeah xp from chests is imho only really good if your next level up can be something groundbreaking otherwise you dont really gain much tempo from it and unless the game is already won 10 towns each providing a shitload of income you likely need gold all the time

  probably not like the euro one  why not its only whites who care about this kind of nonsense

korean console gaming
  arcade vs nintendo the sega ports of the mk games are way uglier
  also adding chinese gaming in general
  lol of all games had no idea one of my favorite ps1 games had a ww2 cartoon stereotype in it
  also anybody notice how jerseys eyes are different too theyre a little bigger no idea why they changed that
  i feel like going fully selfaware is the only way to comply with censors if you must censor developers should do it in a way that essentially flips the bird at the people demanding censorship and informs the audience that they are being nannied by the publisher/government/etc this is a perfect example
  especially since you could remove it with a simple console command
  new jersey devil was released in europe i remember reading about it in the import section of german vidya magazine back in the day but i always thought it was usa only  again weird censorship as that particular caricature is more of an american style/stereotype

no  and get the fuck back to vp u trashbag retard
nope
  lol so edgy
  i recall something on youtube  youre not fooling anyone
if the mew glitch is trainer flight/death warp into that slowpoke trainer the short answer is no    the long answer is yes if you fuck it up  bit 0 of cd60 and d730 are easy to set again they disable use of start and partially a  b and set if a trainer is walking to you so you cant get stuck after fleeing    it might make some object or npc disappear  other anons dont know shit you can remove both overworld snorlax with this glitch    but since you can start a fight with any index mod 256 you can trigger freezes with jacred no 200 or royally fuck up your save with zzazzs at 251255
good ps1 games you can find for cheap
  a modchip can unlock the entire ps1 library for like 5 these days
chrono cross is very cheap even new same with most final fantasy games
  fuck that i got mine followed instructions perfectly but the hot glue ruined the fucking ps1
  how does hot glue ruin a ps1 its non conductive are you stupid the actual reason it stopped working is because youre a retard who most likely soldered poorly
  you can find no one can stop mr domino for under 10 and its a gem really whacky weird japanese puzzle game its a great time
    twisted metal 14  jet moto 13  gex enter the gecko  gex deep cover gecko  mortal komat trilogy  tomb raider 1 2 3 and last revelation  pong the next level  pac man world  star wars jedi power battles  rogue trip 2012
  hot glue  yikes
  i thought about it but when doing swap disc trick my ps1 is really loud when reading cdrs and id probably fuck up the soldering i think im better off sticking to official discs
  hot glue  since when do you need hot glue to install a mod chip
  retard
  what you never soldered anything before hurrrr what a retard
  hot glue  please be bait if you lack the skill set for soldering you can buy prechipped ps1s for like 35 bucks online
  takes like five minutes to master you genuinely are a retrd if you mess it up somehow seriously consider going back to /v/ or something at least there theyll welcome a fellow dumbass in open arms bet you post pepe and wojak on here too dont even deny it bub i know oh i know

  fucking hell this game brings back memories    also thrasher skate and destroy kind of shitty gameplay but great music
what would you had wanted in a johto sequel
aerial zeroone kinda like starfox  maybe some onfoot levels too maybe to add some stealth to the mix  being able to use aid pokemon to interact with other monsters or the enviroment anywhere
  playing pokemon games    snap
more of the same thing a lot more more items more special interactions more secrets maybe light rpg elements like visiting towns and interacting with npcs but idk what youd get out it because npc quests and having to buy items would be shitty
  tons of special interactions and secrets to really enhance replay value only a few required to actually beat the game and most of them for fans who like to discover new things branching paths you can choose from mid level with some requiring getting pokemon to do things for you to actually open the paths
  pokemon spinoffs are unironically better than the mainline games    same with kirby and final fantasy
uhh collecting samples from your environment not like semen samples just like dirt or something a tuft of a pokemons hair not feces either
how about boss battles  i guess something like mew but more elaborated say you have to face hooh or something and you need to use different items to fight him in order to be able to take pictures
put it on the gamecube  make the levels more detailed  have gba connectivity  make it a budget title
  how did you miss the joke anon
  branching paths on levels
itt things only you saw
were they the best company of the 32/64 bit era
probably not but it was the king of the arcades along with sega and capcom
  rage racer is my favorite arcade racer and soul blade my favorite 3d fighter so i say yes
  none of those are williams
  i prefer namcot
  ps1 had the best namco museum collection so i agree
  unironically it was crapcom
  no
  crapcom used to be the best
  thats because the namco museums used to actually have museums in them
theyve always been the king of the arcade along with taito
has anyone attempted to port the nds re models into re pc
    theyve been ported to remaster and im pretty sure i saw a mod a while back but re13 mods are generally a mixed bag of functionality since 80 of the links are dead
    a survival horror game with anime characters    i never knew how much i wanted this
  most survival horror games from the 90s have anime characters
    
    they go for realism like re or theyre action games deep fear and hard edge are prerendered backgrounds kind of anime and re style controls but action games     chaos break is kinda anime but its more like an action game with some awkward horror thrown in     
    depends on what you mean by anime  chaos break and parasite eve are really the only overly anime stylized survival horror games i can think of
    yeah pe has big kawaii eyesa nd is the closest its an rpghorror fusion too theres no anime horror game    fear effect is another game that plays like re and has a few zombies but is really more actionadventure
  theres chaos break and parasite eve which have anime artstyle fear effect have a more comic book/western cartoon style blue stinger is sorta anime    unless you count games set in japan or with a majority japanese characters interactive/fmv games or overwhelmingly guro hgames thats really about it in terms of anime horror games
    and none of them really count as re style horror or survival horror
  blue stinger kind of does i guess  chaos break does have some arcade features but its also a pretty restyle game
  i know what you want op we all want it  
  i touched jills butt a lot when she wore this    rebeccas cheerleader outfit was also great
can we talk about /vr/ dragon ball i fucking loved super gokuden when i was a kid it was one of my first ever imports its too bad the premise is fucking stupid it wasnt until i played a translation recently that i realized its a glorified trivia game more than an rpg that battle system was a fucking blast though then theres super saiya densetsu its decent enough but im not a big fan of card battling if they were to make something like saiya with a gokuuden battle system i would eat that shit up whats your favorite /vr/ dragon ball game and why the fuck hasnt there been a good turn based rpg
dbz stopped being objectively good after the cell saga    dbz stopped actually being good after the sayjin saga
going to go semiofftopic are there any good doctor slump games been wanting to play one after watching its anime
  do you realize how stupid you sound    i didnt think dbz was good after the saiyan saga  but its a fact that it was good through the end of the cell saga    ill just throw this out herecounting android and cell as one saga    nameksaiyanbuucell
  ive seen people praise the ps1 game you cant dent the graphics are stellar for its platform never played it myself tho
    fug forgot pic
  i literally only covered my ass even mentioning the cell saga    i actually do think dbz stopped being good after the saiyan saga frezia was fucking gay and so was cell it was the same shit but with more explosions and none of the lore or culture that db was even about in the first place if we are going that far dbz stopped being good after goku beat piccolo    dbz past the saiyan saga is for retards
  i actually agree with you somewhat but you shouldnt feel the need to cover yourself from incels for insulting their favorite dbz saga    i feel like the saiyan saga was very much dragon ball natural continuation the characters all had a role and mattered the namek saga was a good segue though it was essentially the same saga i fucking hate the cell saga and never understood the love for it much of the animation was pretty bad to boot it lost its identity the buu saga though felt to me like a return to form more gags a tourney etc anyone who doesnt understand why people dont like every saga past the saiyan saga doesnt have a very good understanding of what makes dragon ball also super can suck my donkey nuts
  it wasnt until i played a translation recently that i realized its a glorified trivia game    i think thats amazing imo and the trivia parts only come up during dialogue scenes the fight is much closer to what you find on ultimate tenkaichi in that its rps like i also love that and how it can get tense along with all the minigames plus the games story is very flexible and it has a cutscene for every possible bad ending which is fucking amazing and as usual you get yamamoto in its prime with a lot of good tracks that returned in final bout i think you are being too harsh on the gokuuden series      how about the entirety of 80s/90s dragon ball basically everything regarding the manga never stopped being good you dumb faggot even gt was okay in the first bunch of episodes before turning into the z ova series
  that really reminds me of mega man legends
im actually shocked they never made a dragon quest clone for og db after it being a top down zelda like game with dragon power it just became this strange card system like game you would think a basic dragon quest rpg with goku and the crew would have worked perfectly
  i havent played the fc or sfc rpgs nor the pce game but all the prehyper dimension fighting games are tosh    shin budokai is also tosh barely better than ultimate battle 22 final bout is unplayable actually worse than ub22
  shin budokai  i meant shin butouden    shin budokai psp game is decent
  ub27 is not a terrible game and pretty fun when you get around to it at least you dont have to suffer the intros from the japanese version suffer as in theyre cool but afaik you cant disable them and they increase the loading times final bout is flawed beyond belief but still fun if you know what to do the problem with people playing it is assuming they can grasp its limited mechanics without a manual or faq    im one of those faggots that dont sing fighterz to high praise simply because it doesnt feel like a db game anymore but an arcsys game with a db paint on it which i guess is the whole point
  but all the prehyper dimension fighting games are tosh  super butoden 2 is one of the best dbz games period  butoden 3 is also pretty good except it doesnt have a story mode  shin butoden is indeed a disappointment though they fucked up
theres a ds game that covered the saiyan saga pretty good wrecking vegeta with kaiokengenki dama was a blast
  yamamoto in its prime with a lot of good tracks that returned in final bout    wait what what tracks     i think you are being too harsh on the gokuuden series    maybe to some extent i mean i did enjoy the shit out of them when i didnt even know what was going on i actually played through the first gokuuden recently as an alternative to reading the manga fuckin red ribbon arc is just soooo boring to me
  and as usual you get yamamoto in its prime  fuck yes the gokuden soundtrack is amazing  this is also probably the comfiest menu music  ttps//wwwyoutubecom/watchvnpxgnjrbkqk  i also like to play the gokuden games as an alternative to the manga its weird because it doesnt really have that many action graphics most of them are profile pictures many many of them making characters very expressive ala vn  but somehow it nails the feel of the manga pretty well battles are alright you can make the game fun if you want to fuck around with the custom moveset otherwise you can spam the strongest attack and youll rarely fail  and yes all the alternate scenarios are fun to see i still havent unlocked them all   i also like the detail of being able to see the manga covers on the menu screen
  wait what what tracks    i think theyre kakuseihen tracks only the one from the tournament fights and when goku goes ssj
  that illustration of freeza is one of my favorites
  we got something better
  kino
    is this the legend idainaru db densetsu and  insert title here by replying the holy trinity of 90s db games
  butoden 2 obviously
  was actually breddy gud too bad theres no fantran
    youre a fucking autist retard who cant understand basic narrative    its pretty clear that goku turning super sayan and killing frieza whos responsible for killing off gokus species is the closure dragon ball needed since the first episode weird kid with a tail grows up discovers his roots and avenges his species end of story youre gay
namek/frieza were good but it had some dumb shit in it that spelled the doom of the series namely the namek dbs being so powerful it made fine sense that they would be since they were made on namek and not by some rogue but it made death cheap the earth dbs could bring you back once and that was it krillin dying a second time could have been tragic but it just didnt feel that much like it mattered because now there were all these loopholes    it was the most gruesomely violent saga which was cool but you also had some dumb drawnout fights and cheesy moments like vegeta being tortured and killed by frieza goku turning super saiyan is also ruined by this five minutes that turns into 10 episodes he should have just killed him outright having this whole routine where they power up and goku tries to show him mercy lessened the impact
  namek dragon balls were fine as long as they never came back after the elder died dendes dragon balls should have had the same parameters as kamisamas
  holy shit that could almost be a dreamcast game when was this released
  negro its in the the fucking image
  fuck me i was so drawn into the visuals
dont know if this counts as retro but it is for the gbc dbz legendary super warriors my favorite dbz game ever and one of my favorite video games ever its crazy how many characters and abilities they could fit onto such a tiny cartridge
  ive tried so many times to get into this game but the start is soooooooo gaddang slow can you recommend a save file i just want to pick up and play beyond the tutorial section i understand how to play
  work perfectly but not retro
  if you want to fuck around with the custom moveset  i wish i wasnt a brainlet so i could figure that shit out
  toriyama didnt have that planned from dragonball though he really made up stuff on the go and retconned some things originally planet vegeta had only been destroyed a couple years before raditz arrives on earth and king kai corroborates this when goku is training with him it wasnt until the bardock tv special aired in 1990 it originally aired in japan during the fight against guldo that freiza destroying planet vegeta became canon
saiyan  22nd budokai  23rd budokai  freeza  21st budokai  demon king piccolo  majin boo  red ribbon army  cell  pilaf
  toriyama didnt really have anything planned past the pilaf saga it was a long 10 year journey of just making up shit and it was glorious
  based
  come on dude its not that hard you learn attacks as you progress through the game you assign attacks to certain buttons/button combos eg a for rock paper scissors up a for nyoibo attack
  butoden 3 is also pretty good except it doesnt have a story mode  why do you pretend to give a shit 95 of you cant read moon and both the french and english translations are pretty much gibberish
  95 of you cant read moon  well as a kid i sure didnt but i still enjoyed all these interactive cutscenes on super butoden 2  at the time only original dragon ball was airing on tv so i had no idea who all these characters were it was very confusing but at the same time it was so mysterious to me   then i learned how to get all the alternate scenarios by trial and error by playing the game over and over definitely didnt need to understand it to enjoy it  now i can read japanese and its cool but the best thing about the story mode are the actual cutscenes graphics the music and the atmosphere
  how did you learn to read moon ive been dabbling for years but i get so hung up on some things that i give up after a while like how the fuck does o genki desu ka mean how are you litteral translation reads like gibberish
  not the othre guy but are you serious and willing to put in time and effort    in general  practice reading and use anki to help learn vocab via the sentences method    if you want to learn to speak do a lot of listening practice as well    mattvsjapan has a good channel to help you get started even if it gets memed a bit too much
db threads on /a/ are such shitshows
  i have studied a bit in the past but in reality its that im in constant contact with the language im not fluid in it probably id be a lot better if i actually studied hard but i can read simple stuff and get a general idea plus since i know dragon ball and the context its a lot easier to follow the text in the games
  thanks for the suggestions      good thing were on /vr/ then
make way for the real dragonball game
  i in ironically loved this game when i was a kid it along with final bout member disc swapping i bought a special add on for my ps1 that allowed you to play imports via disc swap not realizing that it was just a knock off game shark which i had already owned
  great roster but the gameplay is abysmal  shin butoden is better but thats not even saying much  butoden 2 and 3 bu yu retsuden and hyper dimension are the best retro dbz fighters
how come no one ever talks about butouden 1 i find it to be a unique entry sure it was rough around the edges but i found it was neat to be able to fight as imperfect cell 16 and 20
  its because gameplaywise butoden 2 blew it out of the water of course but yeah it has an interesting roster of characters and comfy ass graphics and as always good music too
  like how the fuck does o genki desu ka mean how are you litteral translation reads like gibberish  it literally translates to are you in good spirits and if you cant wrap your head around how that works as a friendly greeting the same way how are youdoes in english there might be something wrong with your ability to interpret meaning
  they used to be fine they went to shit when super started and all the /v/ kids flocked in
  whatch out the nip police are here
  tpic related    wouldnt are you in good spirits be anata wa genki either fucking way its a language so very different from english that it just doesnt make sense to put down a random anon on the internet for not understanding on the same level as you
  understanding the barest basics of how the concept of language works is too much for murricans  holy shit
  
    get cucked i know its you hidinginmyroom
  it might help if you dont think of genki so much as something with a direct translation it suggests different things in different contexts although the general theme persists        japanese has a lot of these but its not unique to japanese whether your native language is english or something else you have probably been using words that arent really translatable in these cases foreign languages tend to just adopt the word as it is    now thats not me advising you to start using the word genki in regular english discourse but in a certain light you could
dragonball thread  gets ruined when the americans show up  every time
  hoyoyo
  thank you for the insight true the concept of a word taking on context specific meaning exists in english too it can just be frustrating when trying to grasp a greater understanding of a language as a whole      im the american who started this thread was it doomed from the start
  was it doomed from the start  yes
what the hell is this last present
a free google search
  when this game came out people still believed in love
  that filters really fucking bad though like have you ever even seen a crt
  is this the preferred shader of zoomers who havent played on a crt before also you know theres a native pc port of nights that includes the christmas special right
  not him but the steam port is really fucking bad the porting team was shit on for not including true analog control at launch so they hastily patched it in and it feels absolutely nothing like the original saturn version
glasses
  im not looking for an authentic crt look if i wanted that id spend money on an actual crt and related equipment i just like the way it looks though it does tend to make the picture a bit darker do you know how i can adjust the gamma in mednafen    also i wasnt aware there was a native pc port but id rather play the saturn version anyway since its what was originally released
why is this game so hard
git gud nigger
it is actually really easy maybe the first maps are more challenging
its probably one of the easiest srpgs ive ever played
  a better question is why is this game so boring
  because it came out in the twilight years of the snes when square started focus on graphics over everything else and better srpgs were available elsewhere already fire emblem ogre battle etc if bahamut lagoon came out maybe 3 or 4 years earlier it wouldve been pretty innovative but by the time it released it was already much weaker than existing titles on offer
the only hard part is finding the will to keep slogging through braindead maps with zero challenge and to put up with the annoying as fuck characters
  this game is pathetically easy esp for an srpg easiest one ive played  whats wrong with you
  why dont you dragon breed
  hard  i went in blind to this game well over ten years ago  by sheer random chance i ended up with a bunch of dragons that couldnt take dmg immune to all types   game was a steamroll easy fuckin peasy
  im surprised this didnt get much attention but apparently floppies that contained the source code popped up on an ebay auction earlier this month someone won the auction and has very recently dumped the source code pretty interesting stuff to look at
isnt this technically the doom or wolf3d source code or did they actually bother coding their own 3d engine for the snes
  its based off of the wolf3d engine but it has been modified
  surprised this didnt get much attention   most of this stuff doesnt get much attention at all unless clickbait gaming journalism latches onto it and tells people that they should care about it sad
  huh  i thought it we got source code of noah 3d when pc version of it got rereleased on steam or was it only the code of source port
  i believe it was only the source code for the port the source code that was recently released is for the original snes version
  if its the source of snes version then its fucking great because it was based on snes wolf 3d and it never got a source code release
  i gone through the code a little bit and it looksa lot of the code for the engine has been modified judging by the some of the dates the files in source have been modified
half the code is asm the other half is c  saw this had to smile
  excellent might as well since the commercial steam release contains a redone engine along with a super famicom rom
  and found the code that locks the game to a strict 15 fps i wonder if the snes starts getting unstable without the lock or if they just programmed the game to rely on a specific 15 fps
  and i dont see these cheats listed anywhere online for this game but then again i dont know why anyone would want to play this
  they almost certainly set it to 15 fps to maintain a constant frame rate because of how cpu intensive the game is if they let the game run as fast as it wanted to it would probably stutter badly dropping frames here and there so as to gain more time to compute any given frame    i hack snes games so if anyone has a question about the code they cant figure out i could help
  one of the other funny things is that they retained most of the filenames from the wolfenstein engine  htlr_atklbm and htlr_wlklbm are still in there
was the spiritual warfare source code ever made available
  i dont think so
      i doubt theres much anything different from most wolf3d sourcecode but super 3d noahs ark did have some advantages over basic wolf3d  sprite resolution textures on ceilings and floors more weapons / enemy options etc
  they did make a few modifications to the engine but i dont really have much time right now to list out of the changes
  all of the changes
  maybe they were used by the developers while they were working on the game
what differences are there between playing super 3d noahs ark pc port and super 3d noahs ark snes rom on emulator on pc
  the pc version is built using a new engine the graphics are in higher quality so thats one thing going for it nowadays playing the snes version on an emulator is pretty much identical to playing it on an actual snes
thanks man ill take a look
  only npcs care about what game journalists have to say anyway
  the steam version runs on the ecwolf source port    terrible game btw dunno why i bought it
  how did they convert c into snes assembly
  they used a set of utilities that could compile c code into snes assembly i believe it was called zardoz
you guys remember that mk3 source code release remember how theres no silicon graphics workstation emulators out there and how one anon said mame/mess was probably going to be the first poor bastard was right mame 0204 release notes state  theres also been some progress on the road to silicon graphics workstation emulation and allows irix installer to run until it fails with a scsi error looks like mame/mess might actually make the first silicon graphics workstation emulator
  perhaps we might have a chance at compiling nintendo 64 stuff once the emulator gets somewhere
itt music that literally send shivers down your spine or makes you wanna dance    ill start 
underrated af i never hear anyone talk about this game or its soundtrack    
mandatory special thanks to the sm2000 thread for this                          
    wruuuuuuu trriiiiii puirprpririri tiiririri diiin din dinnn din din dyn din par ram ram ram pararaam druuu dudududruudyy
heroes iii should count right  
    i never felt so hyped to pump quarters into an arcade machine than when i heard this    now that i think about it that might have been the first time i was ever in an arcade what a way to start
  
    
                  
        
  at dooms gate  remake  
                                    
  its an orchestral cover of what i consider some top shelf vidya music
  
  
  is this the same composer as the unreal tournament music
  a team composed each soundtrack but iirc there was a bunch of overlap between the two groups
  
                                    saaaaaaaaaaarge      if you dont feel emotions listening to the last one then you are as plastic as the soldiers in the game    will post more later i love these sorts of threads
    and the non/vr/ version  
  alexander brandon composed most of the music for deus ex and he also composed a fair bit of music for unreal both games share the same music format and i reckon the same samples so they definitely sound similar
    slightly outside of /vr/ but this version of grabbag is my favorite    
    jazz jackrabbits music carries the fucking game
what do i get for winning the thread    
sorcerian  holy fucking shit this has no right being this good  
    recently discovered this and its amazing
    is this the audio equivalent of cracking open a cold monster
                    
is this the best /vr/ theme    
  thats a damn good one for me its here come the heroes  
  good choice op  arcade music is rad  
  old school konami was so kickass  
  this rips m8 even better because the chorus sounds like walk the dinosaur  
good but this from some shitty euro gb shovelware actually is the best one  
such a fantastic game ive played it about 30 times though still some secrets to be discovered probably just easter eggs or nothing  eg blue ribbon     none of the following are sequels  timestalkers  ladystalker   dark savior  alundra pretty close but too much talking        this intro medley is so good especially from 520
when you finally get to verla and start exploring the overworld track changes to this and it gets me pumped every ttime     
    the only thing stopping landstalker from being 10/10 in my books is that it would have been fairly simple to add a shadow underneath blocks even just a dithered square since i think transparency on genesis wasnt done until ranger x
  plenty of games use shadow/highlight for transparency effects
  its actually intentionally left out as part of the puzzle its intentionally done in that sort of perspective with that optical illusion to mess with your brain and make you have to guess what youre seeing instead of reacting with your eyes alone
  on genesis a lot of the reviews of this game at the time were negative because players couldnt figure out where nige/lyle was located relative to the platforms they were wrong its easy and fairly intuitive and fun to figure out  but it would make it easier
  ill find the megazone review from australia at the time they gave it a 2/10 lol
    i was wrong they gave it a 9/10 there was another magazine they also had a tv show the main guy had long curly hair and ranted about how he hated it
  yes thats probably what sega put that feature in for i am looking at it in hindsight though so maybe it was rare when this game was being made
  every single isometric platformer has disappointed me since landstalker i have hope for tunic which looks fun but i doubt anything could ever be as good as this its almost metroid like in its world design
  pussy journalist probably couldnt pass the tree or the sorcery part lol
  from his descriptions he didnt even get past the water shrine
help me out i am a long time sega fan and owned the genesis actually mega drive since i am uk since the sonic 1 days i have played and loved many genesis games both on the original console releases and later via emulation but i just cannot get into landstalker shining force phantasy star legend of zelda etc have all been immensely enjoyable to me but landstalker i remember when it came out in the 1990s game magazines called it one of segas best ever games but the music is offensive and the graphics seem really coarse and horrible somehow so tell me is it really worth playing in 2018
  op here    i love the music well the melody anyway it could have been composed to sound better the sound effects are minimal youll hear woah a lot          as for the gameplay personally i think it is unparalleled the isometric perspective lends the game something that legend of zelda was missing     the plot is also enjoyable it is rare to find a game that has an innocence to it like this there is no big evil bad guy youre a treasure hunter you want to find treasure people get in your way you arent out to save the world you help people out as you go even the big bad isnt actually that bad just a dude driven by greed     you need to play it with an original genesis/md controller or something that doesnt have a 4 way direction pad one that actually has the diagonals included in it not something like the ps4 controller
  yar its intentionall all right funny thing is those jumping puzzles are actually all straight lines they look like you have to do some crazy twists and turns and the game gives you the ability to twist and turn midair but only a straight jump is ever needed and yet it fucks with players to this day so many of whom claim the jumps as being impossible bullshit      they also had a tv show the main guy had long curly hair   sounds like the zone
  the zone  thats the one when they reviewed landstalker i think i shouted at the tv     straight lines  yep i think half the people who hated this based their entire review on the intro which has him doing all these crazy jumps with no indication of where to jump to
  meh i found it on youtube i guess i didnt remember it very well as one guy said it was great and the other said he didnt usually like rpgs and found the controls for this frustrating but rpg lovers would be all over it memory is a funny thing
  besides the awful stiff combat of course
  yep i think half the people who hated this based their entire review on the intro which has him doing all these crazy jumps with no indication of where to jump to  that intro is fucking awesome man
  stiff is really the opposite of what it is its slip and slidey like airhockey or something
  i was about 10 when i first saw it and it reminded me of indiana jones so i was sold on it from the start
what are some /vr/ games with inverse difficulty curve game starts out hard and gets easier as the game goes on    pic related is a pretty good example of this you have very little heath early on second level in the game is one of longest levels in the game and if you dont get enough points for the extra block of health after it the third level is pretty long/challenging as well the second you get the second block of health at end of level the game get much easier and when you get the third the game becomes a fucking joke difficultywise
  river city ransom its not a difficult game by any means but if youre willing to grind for it you can make your character so ridiculously powerful that it can shrug off attacks from nearly anything in the game
metroidvanias usually are like that
  almost every action progressfest even traditonal mega man games kinda have this with the possible exception of x6 and its partially hated for that by the resident babies at the very least in the portion where you can select between several different levels youll always have more stuff to tackle the levels as you go on even though any of them could be your first and their progression is hard capped
megaman by far 1  zelda is big on this  rpgs like saga frontier
  are you sure for zelda zelda 1 2 and lttp get harder as the game goes on the last dungeons in zelda 1 and second quest are particularly hellish
  once i get like 10 hearts and a couple bottles i literally never run out of life    the only brutal late game zelda was zelda 2
super c  contra  contra iv the alien wars    prove me wrong
  looking good
contra iv is better than all of them desu but that small error aside youre right
  wheres hard corps
  i was expecting it to be at the bottom of the list since its hipster to shit on hard cops now for some reason
  t nintendoodoo
  t mental 12 year old who can only think in company war terms  hard corps uprising is the best and it didnt grace the abortion nintendo called a console with its presence
  wonder why hard corps is proper contra hard mode
  maybe if the only contras youve played were the nes ones its not a hard game even with ray nvm brownie or fang with his stupid punch abuse even alien wars hard mode was tougher
  hard corps was more about trial and error than contra 3
  i actually agree with this and decline to submit any contrary evidence    good job for having the right opinion      i cant do shit on alien wars hard mode desu hc and c4 dont have anything on that
  sure but thats all they are once you learn the boss patterns and which weapons to use where you just stand still waiting for them to die while occasionally dodging contra 3s more frantic than that with more rng that matters
  underrated
  that filter is fucking disgusting    lol    this but desu i think hard corps is really fun right up there with contra iv and super c
whats the best classic controller for pc   ie a controller without analogue sticks
  if you are looking for snes look up 8bitdo they are very good quality and similar in feel to oryginal snes controler  however they are expensive
  i bought this today       is it good i need it for yabauseqt and kega fusion
  they are expensive fuck me
hopefully getting one for christmas  also look at ibuffilo snes controller  last week i look at 8bitdo it was 28 i look at it tye next day 57 fucking quid
yus
  xbox one fuck off with the no analog the dpad on the x1 makes up for having some extra weight your baby arms cant handle
  it may be a decent d pad but its position sucks any cobtroller that has the d pad in a secondary position will never be as good for retro games as one with d pad only
  ie a controller without analogue sticks  what the fuck just get the ds4 and dont use the analog sticks thats what i do its better than any other controller i ever used
i have the innext controllers with the light and dark purple colored buttons 2pack for 15 bucks on amazon and work perfectly
i love my ibuffalo snes controller
  best  best for what in almost all cases the answer will be an arcade stick except when you want to put it in your pocket
  stop perpetuating this meme the xbox one dpad is awful
  the ds4 is good but its not perfect for every use amond other things it lacks analogue face buttons ps2 and ps3 emulation it lacks 6 face buttons on the right side n64 saturn mame fight games   theres really no one controller capable of doing all systems justice the ds4 is good for modern pc games and wii u emulation due to the built in gyro    i personally own an 8bitdo snes controller which i use for nes/snes games  a real n64 controller with adapter for n64 and sometimes nes games great dpad  xbox one controller for pc and gamecube games not perfect for gc but ok i also use it for wiiu but gyro sections in games require use of my wii controller    and last but not least i have a wiimotion plus with nunchuk and sensor bar for wii games    looking to buy a ds3 for ps2 and ps3 games though
  ive never held a saturn pad before how does it feel compared to the mega drive controller i want to get one or the other in the future
  i bought one and half the buttons did not respond with the correct amount of force ended up trashing it
  gravis gamepad    this looks fucking good    cringe      these might have been the ones i bought i literally dont remember not home right now and cant check but i have some cute usb knockoff snes controllers that work fucking fine feel fucking good and theyre good enough for every game i play on pc that would need them slain bloodstained curse of the moon etc
  dont think about it like that whats your favorite contrller of that kind in general get an adapter for that
  shittiest dpad ever buttons had a travel distance of 00001mm for that isthisthingbroken feel and it was uncomfortable to hold the mid 90s were a different time
    hi guys any recommendations for a good dpad controller with analogue too    is xbox one controller a meme should i just have two controllers one for analogue and one for dpad    thanks this 360 dpad is absolutely horriblee
  looks like the saturn controller i just bought but this one looks like shit anything similar with 6 front buttons  lr triggers to propose
  xbox one dpad is shit its clicky and in the wrong position  never trust a microshit fanboy theyve been goofed in buying the shittest console of the last 3 generation and are trying to rationalize with at least the controller is good  no it isnt
ibuffalo snes controller is like 13 and works real good
  13  not in yuroland sadly
    well its much better than 360 dpad bullshit it is a bit too clicky but ive played all nes snes and neo geo games on it without problems then i moved fully to ds4 because while analog sticks and triggers are worse the rest of the controller is much better
  dunno where youre looking you can get one for 15 eurodollars  
  never looked back since i purchased it
  im not in naziland sadly pic related is the price i get clicking on your link
  its the link right under the green line of text where it says 15 neu i think amazonde delivers to most european countries western ones at least
the knockoff mega drive controller that comes with the korean version of guilty gear x is one of the better win 9x gameport controllers out there  the drivers are absolute ass and only in korean though could probably be fixed by a competent software engineer in an afternoon
  15  12 shipping  it sucks being a mario  20 bucks for a snes controller seems a little too much ill wait for a discount and just use my dualshocks for now
  does it work under ubuntu my pdp xbox one controller is not working at all thats why i bought the saturn usb one      genuine controllers are now over 20 in pawn shops
  20 in pawn shops  and probably even more on ebay
  get a wii u pro controller they are cheap now
    this
  ibuffalo snes controllers are what youre looking for similar to the originals in almost every way except for the fact that its about 1g lighter you can fix this by taping a quarter to the inside dont buy the famicom variant the shoulder buttons are too tiny since they werent designed to be on famicom controllers     can anyone suggest a decent knockoff 6 face genesis controller to me ive tried a few but most suck ass
  i am this fag  and snooty about dpads i can at least say that the xbone dpad is a hell of a step up from the absolute garbage xbox 360 dpad re axis with a dpadlike face its not the best but if you want to settle for an okay dpad with a controller with more versatility then the xbone controller is serviceable to say the least
dual shock 4 the dpad is centrally placed it doesnt matter than it also has analogs    the dpad is also extremely comfortable and a huge step up over previous dual shocks which have a rough dpad for some insane reason
    you should have just gotten an adapter that thing looks jank as fuck
  if you arent using the real controller with this bad boy you already fucked up
  about half as good as the xbox one controller why bother with it
  i just said why it has a central comfortable dpad    the xbox one has an offcenter tiny dpad for ants
been looking for a nonshit usb nes controller but they dont seem to exist
    decided to look up bliss box ended up on some porn site    yeah probably should have found a better name for this device
  buy an original one  an adapter duh i have one for my snes controller and it works perfectly
  thanks i didnt think of that im a retard
  is this real how does it even work
  blissbox  do i stick my dick in it
  happened to me too i dont know why i bought a shitty usb controller before i got the adapter
  its good enough to play cuphead with so its good enough for anything else
what the fuck is with all these snes controllers with the buttons being 4 different colors my controllers all had 4 shades of purple for the buttons
  the eu/japan snes/sufami has colored buttons and a different design
  same here though i have the playstation looking one    has served me well
  american snes had pink and purple buttons on a gray controller you probably didnt know that super mario rpg has battle menu buttons were color coded outside of the usa release so its technically less optimal but the pink/purple is very nostalgic for me     speaking of snes controllers dont buy this i got it as a gift just tested it and its broken not a qa problem either its just designed this poorly the contacts are not fitted to the dpad so pressing a direction on the dpad doesnt cause input instead you have to press down the center and rock the dpad in the direction you want     it came with a wii to usb adapter but the wii classic controllers have really short cables if anyone has advice on fixing the dpad let me know
    since when is 30 dollars expensive    where the fuck do you work that they arent paying you minimum wage the rice fields
  if you didnt pay 50 for an arduino  top kek kid the device works well enough must do because its running the same code on the same cpu as other devices and i guess if you want to spend 50 to save yourself a little wiring thats your call but no people who made the same thing or better for a few bucks didnt already fucked up
get yourself one of these  its essentially a better snes gamepad
  can you use that as a usb controller or is that just to charge it
  pink    the fuck
  way better
  usb works fine
  thats all i needed to know was considering this because im tired of relying on halfassed solutions and it just seems like a good fullfeature controller the fc30 pro also looks good though      the x/y buttons what do you call this desaturated purple then looks pink to me anyway im out
  light purple idiot
  lavender
  this ive had mine for a few years now and it works perfectly fine
  saturn pads have the best d pads ever made make sure you are getting the model 2 saturn pads the model 1us pads are garbage
  nice projection
  i dont pay 30 for a controller too many people say has sync problems latency and poor ergonomics just to mimick an old controller im referring to the analog version not the standard without sticks  for the same price i can get an used ds3 thats superior in every way or a logitech thats good enough

  yeah na seems like a chink clone poor burgers
what was sega thinking this was the beginning of the end for them
  dont know what youre on about that thing is aesthetic as fuck in 1991 this would have blown me away
  it did until you played it
      its dragon lair with fmv and a hologram gimmick
  
  wouldnt have been that bad if i hadnt been a poor kid and the game hadnt been like a dollar a play    this should have been the real future everyone should have a fmv cowboy game hologram player in their livingroom instead of a onions gaystation with a bunch of open world qte games
did some youtube eceleb make a video or something about this shit    its 1991 and you see this  1994 is when i saw it and it stole a dollar worth of my quarters learned an important lesson about novelty arcades based around stupid gimmicks
i thought this was a washing machine at first glance lol
  the fighting game they made for this thing was worse
  this thingn lived at golf n stuff for like 7 years i spent half of my whole arcade allowance on it for 30 seconds of getting shot on the first screen i couldnt even tell if the controls worked i think i might have cried about it    if it was 25c i might have played it everytime i went there
  onions    infowarswatching yankee hamburger
  i get that and the trailer is lame as hell but as a kid you walk up to that machine and it feels like magic
  young turkroach detected
my local arcade has this its actually pretty neat to try out in person  i think they made a second one of these too
  never got to play it but im pretty sure shit was too expensive im not wasting all my quarters on one game
  holosseum
  the beginning of the end for sega  in 1991 the same year they release sonic the hedgehog and revitalize their ailing brand    yeah fuck off and get a clue you moron
  for that time it was absolutely remarkable i remember seeing it in arcades when it was released but it was expensive to play and they disappeared not too long after they arrived
  for me i saw it about 1992 at penrith panthers leagues club in western sydney they had this sf2 rainbow edition and a bunch of neo geo games my parents used to park me in the play area outside with my sisters while they went and played the pokies occasionally they would give me a dollar to play a game i was smart enough not to waste it on this i think i used to play tmnt a lot they had a broken machine that if you put in a 20c piece it gave you 4 credits and if you put in a dollar it only gave you one credit and the simpsons arcade game good times
  my parents would do the same damn thing   were off to play pokie machines for a bit you stay here in some shitty kids area of some god forsaken club  i thought the simpsons and tmnt back then were amazing mame just doesnt do them justice the cabinets were great but that damn simpsons game so many of them i saw had bad monitors after awhile theyd start going green in sections of it heh
  they were thinking they could make a lot of money off dumb kids easily fascinated by silly gimmicks their thinking was spot on
  there was always a galaga machine with screenburn on it and the place smelt like ciggy smoke     did you grow up in australia too or is this a worldwide phenomenon these days parents would probably be given the boot for doing it
  grew up in adelaide parents would drag us around the country every so often
  this sounds like a /pol/ meme
gifs  webms    last thread here 
  lol i wanna try this
it burns it burns haaahaahaaa
  i was gonna start the thread with that one but it was in the op of another thread already
    blood will forever be the most entertaining game to watch
  did you record that
  yes
  its even more enjoyable to play
  cool
  why post a webm of you being terrible at the game
  semiplains indians style dress fighting on rocky cliffs    this is problematic
  where in the thread does it state the webm/gif has to show top level gameplay
  i would pay 1000 for a rom of the sm64 beta
  shield  wut
  is someone hoarding it or something
    son of a bitch is that how you get in there
      so what happens when you do this any awesome game breaking bugs
  as far as i know there are no existing copies
  where is stoke
  theres a hidden entrance on the right of it the other way was a glitch
  nothing personal kid
  wait what in the fuck is happening here
that miniature castle in the background
        what games are these
  the hospital was great rest of the game was meh
  first too are different version of xak first one pc engine second one snes the third webm is brave prove
    bloodrayne
  nah nightmare creatures
  thanks
  
  how in the fuck do you do this

    what the fuck is this
  implying its not a regular castle in the distance
      are 1 or more of these ys
  xak the art of visual stage
  all 3 of them
  yep  pc engine  snes  msx
  what i am looking at  looks really sweet wanna play too
  warlock on the genesis there was a snes version toothe webm above that one but had lower framerate and worse controls because of that
  are you fucking kidding me
  thanks for the reply
    what beat em up is this
  ninja warriors snes  a remake is coming up soon looks pretty good to be honest
  a remake is coming up soon looks pretty good to be honest  yep
  what platform is the remake for
  keep in mind that the snes version is a sequel to the arcade/tg16 game and not a port the original is kind of average but the snes game is one of the best singleplane beat em ups ever
  did this ever get a translation released
werent you supposed to be in the test chamber half an hour ago
  i wish nintendo would do some sort of annotated development edition of sm64 and oot where you can play the game at various stages in development with commentary on what changed im sure a lot of people would pay quite a bit for that    its been long enough that they wouldnt be giving away any internal secrets by doing that i guess it gamedev in the 90s they wouldnt have source control or anything but they should at least have the monthly builds in the archive somewhere i guess with very early versions of sm64 youd have issues with the n64 hardware thats targeted not yet being fully stable yet but thats it
  i dont think anything like that has ever been done for any game that would be an interesting idea
  damn man ive never seen the ai popping off so hard that guy is completely styling on you after killing you this is like the new teabagging

what does this mean i dont recall enemies ever dropping food in castlevania iv
  shitty translation it seems
  enemies dropping health never happens except for simons quest which is the odd man out as usual
  i know food was often hidden in walls the only enemy i remember producing food was one of draculas attacks dropping small chicken legs
ive come across some yellow rca video cables     nothing unusual except theyre a bit thicker than than others    notice the writing on the pvc says rg59/u coaxial cable   its clearly labeled video on the yellow rca plug   begin to wonder if this can carry sound like ftype coaxial   upon research i find it impossible to get answer to where is negative connection   have to use multimeter to verify that outer cap is ground   notice that pvc writing on ftype cable also says rg59/u coaxial cable despite it being very different from rca cable with the same labeling   also notice rca written on the plug this ftype coaxial cable    why do they give the exact same name to two very different cables with two different purposes
  because only fucking nerds give a shit just play your snes with suboptimal visuals and shut up
im not sure i understand your issue    rg59 can carry modulated rf with sound just as happily as it can composite video or single channel audio for that matter    ftype is a connector as is rca whilst rg59 is a coaxial cable standard presenting 75 ohm impedance and equally suitable for termination with either
  then explain the need for this
  that exists to multiplex two signals rf from a tv aerial and rf from a computer/console into a single rf input on your television set    it could just as easily be accomplished by a single rg59 cable terminated with an fconnector at one end and an rca at the other but you would have to unplug the console to watch tv
  this is insanity
  fck  sht    we 4channel now
  this for the longest time i thought my old atari was broken turns out it was just an issue with the rf modulator all i needed to do was get an rcacoax adapter and boom
  my atari vcs wouldnt work with my sega system auto rf switch i would just get weird colored bands or such the sega system worked with the atari manual switch if i recall
  i repressed these memories oh god
  my 2600 rf box shocked me once fucking unplugged that thing so fast and never used it again thank hiroshimoot that coaxial adapters exist
  shocked me once  for me the ac adapter was always hot
  why couldnt they just have used hdmi
  fuck
  now youve it
  what
  why couldnt they just have used hdmi  because it didnt exist back then
  hooklineandsinkerjpg
  based coaxial rf poster
  the signal the atari sends actually isnt strong enough to trigger automatic switchboxes it doesnt work with the nintendo rf switch either you have to use a manual switch with the vcs
  yup the 2600 magically outputs a signal with values of less than one quantum so its impossible for it to be detected except by a tv which is also magical or maybe you only ever used shitty switchboxes
this thread has been thoroughly cringy thank you guys i enjoyed it
  of less than one quantum  like that show quantum leap
this must be the most autistic thread on 4chan right now
  still 4chan you shitposting faggot no matter what mooks domain name faggotry says
  its a typical /vr/ thread clueless retards have no idea how things work one single anon slaps the fucking sense into them
  one single anon  based  thats you
  no actually it was me but i didnt think it was rare or cherished knowledge    christ i feel old right now
  like that science thing youll learn about if you stay in school long enough
  rare or cherished knowledge  what knowledge
  im not one single anon  my knowledge isnt rare or cherished  its shared between all your psycho personalities    christ i feel old right now  delusions of knowledge  delusions of age  all around bat shit crazy  you forgot your trip gramps
  happy now dylan
  i am thanks
  those dark days where you had 4 of these daisy chained behind your 17 inch tv
      those auto rf switches need to be powered to work and iirc most consoles designed to use them send 5v dc down the wire for this purpose the 2600 doesnt so it doesnt  also the switch filters out the dc from reaching the tv so depending on the set it may not be wise to use pic related with consoles designed for automatic rf switches
  kek i remember using this to plug my mega drive or vhs on my tv that only had rf input i had to tune the tv to channel 3 or 2 to get the image
  electronics need electrons to work  who woulda figgered
  the dc  what is this
  direct current not a good idea to put too much into a circuit designed to accept only ac alternating current
  wires wire
anyone here own a switcher
  i think i kept my atari vcs switch with the prongs at the end instead of ftype male
because fucking shit
  this thread reminds me that i have 200 in 1999 dollars of coaxial cable running through my entire house and that every wall has 13 access points 1 next to every electrical outlet which also has 2 phone line outlets    ive used them one time and literally got wifi lan working the very next month
  using coaxial for a network when wifi already existed  wew lad
  is that even possible
  coaxial to cat5  hmmmm
  it is old network cards and cables still work itd be dumb as fuck in nearly every situation but possible      you only make yourself look even more foolish trying to act clever
i never thought id be giddy to see an hour long video about third party controllers show up in my youtube feed but here we are are there other channels with the same level of quality as my life in gaming ive tried game sack but just didnt dig it as much
whos the jannetty
baldie is alright but i always want to slap fatty around
  he gets almost uncomfortably defensive about the n64 sometimes
    op here there is a certain annoying quality to the way he enunciates things i dont know if its a speech impediment or some unknown midwestern accent but i do think their content makes up for it their getting your best picture out of x series is just so so comfy for me i watch it for systems i dont even own
  he does fit the nintendo diehard fan look that i have in my mind
  fuck these assholes theyre directly responsible for skyrocketing crt prices
  they needed to show off more controllers
  they didnt even have a hori n64 controller even i have 1 and im a neet
  while i agree with you this shit happens all the time a previously unwanted tech gets rediscovered and things that people gave away for free at one point becomes 100 bucks at best ps3 era stuff is in their lowest in terms of pricing better buy them now before people develop a nostalgia for it and jack up the prices
  i know what you mean i have a friend from minnesota that talks that way too so i guess its just a weird accent  it cracks me up watching the game boy video and realizing that for all of his crowing about visual fidelity his audio plays out of a single giant woodgrainpaneled mono speaker which he likes because its the biggest  also its really weird that crts are what skyrocketed and not framemeisters or osscs    as for op its not the same production value but i dig hard4games
  also its really weird that crts are what skyrocketed and not framemeisters or osscs  not really since you cant really get new crts anymore i imagine once the framemeister officially goes out of production the prices of those will skyrocket too
    i got my crt pictured for free about a year ago just by looking on craigslist just had to go pick it up i know its not a pvm but you cant say its hard or expensive to pick up a decent crt in this day and age you just have to find the right boomer who doesnt know what theyre giving away and pounce on it
  are you high crts are dirt cheap guaranteed everyone in this thread knows someone who is willing to give theirs away
  ive tried game sack but just didnt dig it as much  different content mlig is more about hardware whereas gamesack is about the games but not really indepth look at games or even reviews you get essentially some kind of demo sampler  i like game sack because they go through so many games and i keep a little txt file whenever they mention something i havent heard of but find interesting based on the footage and the two hosts are pretty decent just two dudes that have played a shitload of games and can edit a decent video compilation
provide polished high production value videos  large amounts of useful well organized and objective information pertaining to the greatest hobby on earth  comprehensive analysis of every relevant option pertaining to each topic  avoid worthless hyperbole and only lightly include personal suggestions based on experience at the end of each segment  they dont act like your usual clickbaity lol retro games r hard amiraite ecelebs    anyone who hates these guys are on crack they are pretty much the /vr/ heroes we need but dont deserve
  you are ya pinhead
  fuck no i know the value of what i got  got a sony it was at the end of the crts lifespawn its got picture perfect and at least another 2030 years on it    no way im giving it away or throwing it out  ima sell that baby or make my future spawn play with it while he undergoes eyesight problems
  your fd trinitron is worthless and the costcutting build means it will be lucky to last another 23 years never mind 2030    just thought you should know that
  if youre ok with a little better level of quality i could live stream my morning dumps  and then i get out of bed
  you might like lgr his stuff if usually more pc oriented but its really well done
i like modern vintage gamer his drowsy australian accent and clinical delivery is comforting somehow
  guaranteed everyone in this thread knows someone who is willing to give theirs away  i havent known a single person who still owned a crt within the last 10 years
  cool shill thread dude
may as well post my favs before the inevitable deletion  my life in gaming  game sack  strafefox  retrorgb  lgr  generation 16 still takes forever to make episodes even when he retired his old format  jeremy parish  gaming historian  retropolis zone  geek critique would like him a lot more if he didnt keep his vids delayed behind his goddamned paytreon for several months  gaming historian  classic gaming quarterly specifically his console launch vids  retro pals mostly his playstation year one series and maybe the occasional twitch stream  swan song chronological retrospective for the wonderswan except unlike parish danny and doctor sparkle he actually knows japanese  framerater  snes drunk  stop skeletons from fighting formerly hvgn  mega drive profile hasnt posted a new vid in nearly a year tho  wrestling with gaming  davetona    on a personal note i really wish there were more console retrospectives but with folks who can actually read moon there are only so many translation patches and fans willing to bail them out they should consider learning the language or just stick to the north american libraries i dont know how playstation year one will be expected to continue unless they change their format to focus exclusively on us releases beyond the launch period
  i just want these guys to cover dreamcast/vga/31khz monitors theres a large lack of decent info on these topics
  classic gaming quarterly specifically his console launch vids  the magazine readthroughs are comfy too
  i know its not a pvm  common tvs are actually better than the pvm meme
lukemorse1 has minimal production value since he shoots in a blog style but his breadth of coverage is pretty large arcade pcb and other repairs real hardware gameplay random japan videogame shopping etc hes been around on youtube for quite some time and never delves into the please like subscribe patreon early access culture
same level of quality only digital foundry retro videos dfr is the best retro game focused content out there i enjoy when mlig reviews or covers games in retrospectives but they dont really do that often enough hardware is its own niche however
i havent watched much but console wars was interesting sad that the nintendo half of the channel apparently had some sort of issue so now its just one of the duo running the channel or at least it was that way last i checked
  too bad his wife left him and took their daughter because he couldnt stop buying video games  
   playstation year one is pretty much abandoned at this point and seem like they moved to n64 japanese issue will never be fixed since nobody will have the skills for it
not completely retro but i like mandalore gaming he covers pc games and sometimes the old title like vangers or blood omen  same with ssethtzeentach but he is a lot more memey and loves to break the ever living shit of any game he plays still i think its great to expose the unwashed masses to cool shit like arcanum and homm3    yesteryears mac dude specializes in mac games as you might expect but also some multiplat titles  wish more people covered old pc shit
  apparently that has since been resolved i think he even did a video with his wife a few years ago playing some sort of interactive television show or something
      i like him his video on the psx answered a couple questions i had before getting one but he legitimately has a problem no amount of retro videogames can fill the void in his soul
friendly reminder to report ecelebs as they have nothing to do with retro gaming
  why the fuck is there so much underscan on that
  i had 2 theyre shit
  fuck off shill
  ossc is great but can be a huge pain in the ass and if you really get into the ossc then you start modding systems for scart which is not always easy or you hook up a ps2 and cry because every other game ran interlaced and looks like shit or having to set display settings in the ossc per console etc etc once everything is working then you can possibly get a clear picture but some systems like snes or genesis need additional modding for cleaner signal and the price of the device cables and scart switchers    crt is so much easier emulator feels worse but is probably the ideal way to go especially once you get into some additional options like that ps1 emulator fork that fixes the jittery vertices or ds emulator that can quadruple the resolution or the gamecube emulator that lets you play metroid prime in vr     ive gone too far but ossc will always be for the niche or those who just want to play sega saturn
i enjoy the presentation but the hosts and the sound effects when they plug in peripherals just irk me these two werent bullied enough in school
  these two werent bullied enough in school  id imagine they were bullied a lot would explain that duddleson faggots stilted delivery and deer in headlights look plus his last name is duddleson imagine being that goofy of a fuck with that name and not being bullied
  theyre probably waiting until the dc hdmi mod and hd retrovisions cables are available to do a comparison
  there is a certain annoying quality to the way he enunciates things  yeah i think it has to do with the fact that hes not a naturally good speaker but has tried to improve himself and ends up falling into using some of the same speech patterns/cadences way too much i find him way less obnoxious than the average hey whats up there youtube disc jockey wannabe though
  i find him way less obnoxious than the average hey whats up there youtube disc jockey wannabe though  yeah at least hes not doing the hey guys whats up you guys game nigga here you guys shit
  nothing wrong with a little back again look here
  there is when its so painfully forced because some nobody on youtube is desperate for subscribers and attempting to become the next big eceleb by making up for their total lack of personality by trying to sound like a goddamn 90s radio dj and failing hard    at least the my life in gaming guys are chill and script their stuff ahead of time because theyre just trying to be informative
bought a hori pad a few years ago for 100  thought it was expensive but said fuck it  check ebay completed listings for it now  regularly sells for over 200  mfw
  ya seethe
literally naming yourself try4ce
  snesdrunk is my favorite for quick reviews nothing too informative and no actual hardware but the guy is chill knows his stuff and is really concise without feeling rushed     i really loved game sack but its clear that doing the show is a chore for them now specially for the baldie halfassed reviews and humor that mostly falls flat and i know that dad jokes and silly humor are kind of their shtick but the baldie sounds like somebody chris hansen would have a conversation with
goddamn balding man children are pathetic
the content they produce have really high quality one of my favourite channels on youtube they look and act a little bit weird but still love their show
  try ace  i dont get it
i like mlig i remember when /vr/ was created i thought it was awesome that people still old vidya like i did     i wish this board was more calm and less full of pricks who think think that their epeens are big because they have some obscure game or unpopular opinion or because they have screenshot of their tidy rom folder to post on every thread about real hardware
  tryfource
eceleb cancer
  i know its not a pvm  and youre better off for it    that looks like the gba version somehow running on a crt if it is the gba version that would explain why its not full screen the more important question is why is it running via shitty composite
off topic post ecelebs are cancer
can i just start by saying i wouldnt watch my life in gaming if they werent white niggers just dont have the brains to make such a cutting edge and informational show can i get a show of hands here who else hates the nigger monkeys of the world
  i dont think the blcks can fully comprehend video input/output technology
i had to stare at the picture for about 10 seconds because i couldnt tell if the fat guy had down syndrome or not
  worked
  i see tons of free/10 crts on cl often times good ones like sony trinitons too
  oh thank god i thought i was the only person who feels this way cant explain it either because everything ive ever seen of theirs is legit informative i feel bad about it
  i cant watch their videos they attempt to explain average complexity things in layman terms but dont understand the topic well enough to do so they end up rambling about topics because they dont understand the wikipedia article well enough to change it and make it digestible    it works if you dont know what they are talking about it doesnt if you even know a tiny bit about their chosen topic
  gib example  t understands at least some of what theyre talking about
  the guy on the left is the autistic dude that goes to local game stores and makes hadouken sounds and motions using the local game stores as his social outlet while his mother sits in the car waiting then he goes home and consumes wiki articles and youtube videos of information in hopes to share with his social circles the game stores all while never buying anything and driving his family insane
  go to local game store last night  guys are unironically discussing which papa roach album was the best
  do you not ever watch the channel that is their entire thing reading wikipedia while barely understanding it    watch the modern and retro gaming on 4k tvs one in 5 minutes you can tell they dont understand anything about what they are talking about everything they say about hdr is just something they read somewhere all while taking several minutes to go over it because they just dot get it
    he literally says 5 minutes in that hdmi cables of the past are the same does he not know plenty of 1114 cables had grounded pinouts to avoid voltage issues yes you can get by most of the time with older cables since most people are just doing audio/video and cheap cables are as good as expensive but that was a blatant lie and no one in the comments is correcting them what idiots are these guys and what idiots are their fans/viewers
    autism
  oh i get it you take issue with extremely specific examples that dont at all matter to anyone but you and have no real practical application
  this i hope any fucking beta male that thought he could make a life for himself and his family off of (((youtube))) bucks by talking about vidya fucking kills themselves you are lower than scum
  my life in gaming is really fucking good the ps2 rgb class of them was one of the best  the part that john linneman did for it was great with genuinely informative and cool stuff about the console
  put a fucking bullet in your brain

  its the other way around for me not to be a dick but the bald one sounds like a stereotypical fruity millennial
  try    the nintendo fan usually is the jannetty t nintendo fan
  everyone disagreeing with you has never played melee
  kys  eceleb bullshit is not /vr/    this but unironically  is a great example theyre also the type of people to suggest that you use rgb or some modded svideo out of your genesis instead of composite not realizing that it completely fucks tons of dithering effects in genesis games designed for composite video signal waterfalls in sonic 1 for a very obvious and wellknown example    this but unironically
  not realizing   theyve mentioned how composite blends dithering to achieve transparencies on genesis  hardly anyone thinks its worth the vaseline faggot
    this is the dumbest webm and video ive ever fucking heard of  if these fucking morons looked at wikipedia they could literally just say buy a component cable or use vga for games that support it  my friend literally had component cables and 1080i on gran turismo 4 like fucking 15 years ago how does this youtube channel even fucking exist
  hardly anyone thinks its worth the vaseline faggot  svideo and component are much sharper but lol if you really think this tube looks better in anything other than composite
  because its been 15 years since the whole ps2 gt4 and 1080i was relatively obscure now its like woah so the ps2 was hd all along thank u based life in gaymen12 all the while forgetting to recognize you can use pcsx2
  i know what youre going for but if youre willing to be reasonable then you can also accept that composite dithering effects are less than 10 of all graphics in sonic 2 granted you can personally like the way composite looks but the dithering is the sole positive side effect of color bleed and other signal artifacts that actually worsen the image quality
  i love mine
  emulation
  only because the baldie is such a blind hater
  i prefer snesdrunk over game sack he makes really good videos
this is so much fun you must try this dos rom gold rings of medusa download from 1994  
  eh seems ok whats the point of gameplay form an army and kill medusa
  its in german
  theres nothing wrong mit dast
  looks like shit and its only in kraut
    what the fuck are you on
  thats not the gold version
  dos rom  isnt that amiga
  i for one im enjoying this meme more effort put into subtlety than average
  subtlety  lol subtlety
 dos rom gold    you are using words you dont understand theres no such thing as dos rom
  it was released on both dos and amiga      merelypretendingutx
  disk operating system readonly memory a dos rom is a readonly executable ran on a dos seems pretty straightforward if you have any sense
  files not limited to executables only
  theres no such thing as dos rom  the game package literally says its a cdrom  besides theres an entire field of study devoted to dosroms  
stop wasting my time and tell me how the bazooka sue demo is
  its a blast
  thats kind of a misnomer though technically cdroms arent treated as rom in any system ive ever seen theyre not memory mapped to the cpu address space theyre treated as data coming from an i/o device no different from a floppy or hdd nobody ever called data read from a hdd a rom even if you set it to readonly
  yet they do call a cdrom a cdrom hence the term dosrom  also check that pdf on embedded dosroms for memory mapped to the cpu address space and such
  story checks out
  then why call them roms      bazooka sue  lol boy named sue
  youre making up a situation that never or barely ever happens how many hdds do you see being used in readonly mode what a dumbass ive been collecting dos roms for decades now i think i would know
  who or what is bazooka sue
  how many hdds do you see being used in readonly mode    lots of files are readonly anon and the point is a cdrom isnt memory any way you look at it not even functionally    i cant really find any information on why they named cdroms that my best guess would be because the cd contains an image of a rom which gets loaded into system ram to be executed
  are you literally retarded
whats the difference between gold and the original version
i had this game as a kid did not speak any english and was completely puzzled what the fuck to do
  a sorta larryesque adventure with art by the guy who did the designs for the first lula game
  there is a reason why we should not use the designation dos rom especially if you are mean the stored data that makes up a game  roms as in chip rom images from cartridges or onboard chips are not the same as floppys cdroms or harddisks they dont have files or a file system they are closer to a compiled executable just like you cannot simply open up an exe and look for graphics or sound files you cant open up a rom and find separate files or sprites it all programmed data sitting at different memory addresses  dos roms is a misnomer read only memory is not the one and only thing defining what is a rom and what isnt flash memory on sd cards allows random access reading and writing but you dont call it ram
  but its in german
  vga graphics
  because cd roms were read only memory writable cds were separate things
  too bad we are using the designation dos rom
  thats wrong though and whoever uses the term rom with dos games looks like a child imbecile would you like some glue to dip your crayons in before you eat them
  its not wrong no thanks that sounds gross
  perhaps water colours are more to your liking dos games arent roms son
  stop saying dos
  dos games are readonly memory files so yes they are roms
  you drag the dos roms onto the dosbox emulator and play them how hard can it be dad
  it can get pretty hard if you find the right way to rub it son glad we had the talk
  good grief
  have you lost your mind
  yes
  bazooka sue  i love that series
  better that lsl
  so much fun  yay
  what is you point
with a regulated 9v voltage it can reduces the heat emitted by the components and thus increase the lifetime of the console    should i stop using oem adapters for my old consoles and look for modern third party stuff instead
if you can find a well regulated modern power supply then yes the old ones were fine back in the day but they are worn out now and give far dirtier output than they used to  however im guessing neither you nor i have access to equipment that can objectively measure a psus performance so for us oem is still probably a safer bet
  if i had the oem adpater on hand then i wouldnt even be wondering i had always been sceptical of third party replacements but then i saw this        and now im worried about oldass oem stuff something like above would be a safer bet do you think
  you might be okay with that if you trust the site to have done their due diligence see while switching power supplies are infinitely better than the old ones loads of these cheap chinese ones are designed for phone chargers which are used on phones that safely soak up all the peaks and troughs through their battery management  a bench power supply might be the answer p
  it honestly doesnt make a significant difference and you shouldnt worry about it just make sure the cable is in good condition not too bent and not frayed or cut at all
  you might consider learning a bit about psus and then making an informed decision its possible to create some really good solutions using modern parts but you need to know what youre doing theres a lot of misinformation an a lot of shit equipment out there
  should i stop using oem adapters for my old consoles and look for modern third party stuff instead    consult this handy chart  nintendo no  sega maybe  coleco yes  commodore immediately  pc pic related
remember a poorly constructed ac adapter can damage or destroy equipment   or it can even kill you
gee i wonder if you should take the blurb on a product page trying to feed you lines to get you to purchase said product at face value let me think about that    its fairly easy to test the power output from any given power supply with a fairly cheap multimeter
  poor kitty hes gonna cut himself
what is the worst jrpg youve ever played
  thats like shooting fish in a barrel all gayrpgs are the worst ive ever played
  this all of them are shit
final fantasy mystic quest    not a single doubt in my mind about that pick as my worst battles were mindnumbingly simple dungeons start short  sweet until length creep becomes very real and outta control there was a story and characters in the loosest sense of the terms and your hero always feels a step behind even the shittiest of his companions
  at least mystic quest had you using tools and weapons outside battles to solve puzzles besides only using 2 characters i dont see how the boss combat was any different from mainline final fantasy
  unironically not xenogears  i dont understand why this game gets so much hate on this board
fuck jarpigs and fuck progressfaggots
  this
  you
  that picture depicts a jarpig player as he receives ugly dated cinematics as a substitute for gameplay
your favorite one is the worst one op
   fuckign this ftw    gay ass bich nerd genre lmao for boomers and autists
  this year i played a fuckton of jrpgs and i gotta say the hardest to slog through were breath of fire i and ii they werent necessarily bad or terrible or whatever but they were very poorly paced and there were a couple parts in each where i definitely felt like i had to force myself to push through    also i really like chrono trigger a lot but i dont necessarily see where a lot of its praise comes from when i was younger i thought it was 10/10 now id give it just an okay    i had a much better time playing a bunch of psp jrpgs
theres too many bad ones id rather mention a good one vagrant story
  trigger encourages you to spam techs by placing a save point before every boss and making the tent item extremely cheap to get its a casual as fuck game and thats a good thing
  fyi this thread appears to be a jrpghate circlejerk probably from /vg/ so dont get bummed out if you dont get many serious replies
  kiseki or what
  muh /shmupg/ boogeyman  why are jrpgfags so paranoid
  you started this divisiveness shit now own it
    2 minutes apart
having ids in this board would be amazing /vg/ and cringy shmup niggers would fuck off real quick
  shoot em up is worse than jrpg    fps/platform fag reporting in
the shitlist  mystic ark  bof 13  lufia 1  2
  you arent allowed to hate on my favourite genre because itll hurt my feewings  lol grow a pair my dude      why would you dislike shmups but then enjoy fpss anyways fps platformer and shump are all superior to jarpig junk
            samefagging this hard
my favorite genres are jrpgs shmups and fighting games xenogears is one of my favorite games too
  maybe because fpses are not memorization fests thats designed to rob children from their quarters
  i never said you werent allowed to have opinions i just dont understand why you go into jarpig threads specifically to say how much you dislike jarpigs attention whoring much at least try to contribute to the discussion explaining why you hate things instead of just throwing a blank statement that could apply to anything like jarpigs suck hurr durr
never played through the suikoden series  decided to do it  get through the first three games get to the fourth    it rivals xenosaga 2 in terms of shittiness
  so youre triggered by arcade gaming in general then you know you can enable free play on the machines right    also complaining about memorization makes you sound like a brainlet no offence
  hes got a point though gitting gud at shmups is notoriously repetitive
  dawn of mana
dragon quest vi and dragon quest vii     these games are total fucking borefests theyre both nothing happens the game especially if you play them after you play v what happened
  what do you think of as gameplay    give examples
  mashing the x button for hours on end while reading grade school level writing and occasionally using healing items and buff spells
  i have truly never seen a worse battle system than xenosaga 2s
  i dont think you understood the question what do you think is a good game what do you think good design is
ephemeral fantasia  saga 3  bof i
  lufia 1 of bof1 i guess havent played that many of them
  contrarians that didnt like cant stand that others do
i cant think of a bad one if anything i never liked the mario rpg series theyre too kiddy to me in terms of how the game looks and dialogue
  probably arcana the battles arent interesting the dungeons are pretty boring mazes and its entirely too grindy without satisfying enemies or equipment
  clearly you have never played alien resurrection on the playstation its an interesting and atmospheric game but totally a trial and error affair
  fps are lowest common denominator garbage
    this doom niggers get buttblasted with comments like these because they know its true
  lets git gud at shmups  memorizes enemy spawn/attack patterns by playing the same shit over and over again with nothing changing  whoa such fun now lets play against human opponents in a fps/fighting game/vs puzzle game/basically anything with a proper competitive mode besides get higher number  loses repeatedly  whaaaaaat my 1337 gamer skillz dont work when the opponents can change their tactics and adapt to my repetitious lowthought muscle memory style but shmups are true gameplay games for gameplay gamers like me   face it shmups can be fun but when you start memorizing stages for high scores you basically turn the games into worse grindfests than jrpgs even speed running a single game evolves more than persuiting a highscore in any shmup ever has
  youve never 1ccd any of them have you
haha yeah they suck madden thread bros
  i 1ccd your are mother lmao
  im guessing you dont win when you play fps or fighters either
  ive never completed xenogears because the psn version freezes during a cutscene and its like ive already put 20hrs to into the game at that point and i dont care what happens because its purposefully obtuse and vague   like its not pulling me into a mystery when cryptic masked characters appear and talk about it or him it does the opposite and if ive learned anything from jrpgs its that when they do this the answer wont be revealed for another 20hrs and im suppose to remember these mysterious scene where nothing happened
probably legend of dragoon
  i used to like jrpgs when i was in middle school and high school because they took so much time to get through it was the best dollar to hour of play ratio available since ive become more busy i cant play them anymore without getting pissed off when i only have 2 hours to play games and the entire time is spent in plot scenes and dialogue or fighting random encounters while backtracking through a mazepuzzletimesink i stop having fun
    no better post opno better post
    imagine star wars ending with luke meeting yodathats it
  beyond the beyond
  its almost like square designed ffmq like this on purpose retard its a good game with a great soundtrack
im going to have to go with final fantasy 13 as being the worst i went a whopping 1 hour into the game before i put it down and quit
  final fantasy ii nes and 7th saga american for me never again
  i completely agree on breath of fire 1 and 2 breath of fire 1 was just bland and 2 was a waste of fucking time and complete filler for a good chunk of the game
    its true every fps to me looks like robotron for babies like they just make it piss easy cause cunts couldnt play robotron
  its very easy to work around that freeze ive actually never had it happen to me i presume youre talking about the deus but it doesnt trigger unless you allow deus to use a certain attack
  final fantasy 13  is that the one with lightning mcqueen that game was so fucking bad it looked like a bmovie with interactive segments
  i disagree it looked like a top tier animated movie with interactive segments the story was blah and the voice acting was terrible though
  yeah the graphics were great but the acting and story were b movie thats where im coming from i dont bother to classify it as animation
  probably a pokemon game  strategy boils down to nothing but choosing the right type in each battle leveling is meaningless to a certain extent due to type effectiveness leading to most battles ending in one or two turns buff moves are useless except against gym leaders the elite four or the rare trainer who has more than two pokemon nerf moves are always useless  all of my nostalgia is invested in this shit which is too bad because the games are pretty bad as jrpgs
  they designed it to be so boring you couldnt squeeze a drop of fun from it great good job square
  graphics looked pretty bad to me though ive only seen screenshots typical 360 era washed out muddy looking generic environments
  bmovie with interactive segments    thats pretty much mgs but that game is fun as fuck
  say what you want about the graphics today but i was awestruck at the time
  thats shit art but the models were smooth as fuck
of the ones ive played probably guardians crusade the graphics and soundtrack are atrocious
  it has an insane amount of flaws which outweigh the only reason to play which is the story and in the end you realise that even the story isnt very good    its overreaching idea is good though just terribly executed
golden sun
  this scene while not great isnt that bad and so minuscule that its not worth hating the entire game over
  body conquest is worse then secret of the stars i think i try not to remember the worst of the worst
  actually this scene made me appreciate the game more and not to take it so seriously    its obviously tongue in cheek
  and if ive learned anything from jrpgs its that when they do this the answer wont be revealed for another 20hrs and im suppose to remember these mysterious scene where nothing happened  actually they usually explain whats happening as its happening because the main character will be all like  what who could have thought there was such a conspiracy all along    xenogears in particular ends up just unloading info onto your brain a lot then you replay the game at some point and when stuff happens you notice how cool all the backstory that was happening without being explicitly spelled out for you actually was and you start to wonder what it would have been like if the game had been finished properly or the series expanded the way it was planned out
according to the nips the worst kusogays for the snes are maka maka and idea no hi they look awful
    yeah ive been wanting to get into the bof series for a while but i just cannot find the willpower to play through 1 the first few hours alone were already such a slog fuck
  play some famicon jrpgs to prep you youll appreciate what bof has to offer
  i get a lot of shit for this but tales of the abyss ive never hated a main cast so fucking much in my goddamn life    i also dont think secret of mana is even remotely worth the praise it gets
  tongue in cheek  yep
hey /vr/ im practicing some cvs2 stuff and i have some questions  1 does the dreamcast version has roll cancel i heard console ports got that removed  2 how are you supposed to do it like i read that you have to do a special input then press lplk just after you do the move like you do a dp input and just after the punch/kick button you press lplk and how can i confirm it was succesful do i make the training dummy attack me while i used the special move  3 is there an english patch of the game  hope i can get some answers thanks
1 yes  2 best way to train this is to record ryu doing a fireball replay use blanka to roll cancel through the fireballs      the timing is super strict as far as i remember you only have one or two frames to it so you will be stuck in training mode for a while before the motion becomes muscle memory  the trick is to keep going    3 no idea    4 this is true love we makin
    also do this on a stick like smash the buttons almost simultaneously which is why roll canceling is almost impossible on a pad
  good luck enjoy your entirely fruitless endeavor  at least i can get girls to play strip soulcalibur on dc but cant get them to play mvc2 or cvs2
  welp guess im gonna have a bad time
only the gamecube and xbox ports removed roll cancel youre good    and why would you need an english patch for a game that was released worldwide
  and why would you need an english patch for a game that was released worldwide  i wasnt sure if i was misremembering but i did some digging if there was a us dc release of cvs2 in stores i didnt know about it and cant find any evidence of it now we played burned jp copies theres little japanese text iirc
  theres no english version of cvs2 on dc game is jp only but it was mostly curiosity if someone made it
  honestly roll cancel is cool but its hardcountered by command counters parries and just defense not to mention you can still get thrown
  what a badass
      just play the english gc and xbox ports with a stick or get an adapter for those systems that allows the use of something like a sega saturn pad
evening lads 1cc any cool arcade games lately
  not lately i was working on shinobi a month or two ago might give it another shot
lads  i love it when they dont even try to hide it
whats a 1cc
  nice i should get into the shinobi series myself i played them growing up but itd be good to do them proper      hide what lad      1 credit clear meaning beating the game without continuing pick one of your favorites and give it a shot mate youll learn it at a much deeper level and appreciate it far more
  shinobi is one of the very few games i have 1cced i try shadow dancer from time to time but its way too much for me the second or third stage is already harder then anything in shinobi and the games not really as good besides
no but i fucking beat willy elektrix  robotron is easily the best arcade game ive ever played except for any variation of tetris  how do i get better at it  i always die at either the level with the brain guys the level with the bouncy ball guys or 1 or 2 levels after the level with the bouncy ball guys  my playstyle is i always try to kill the flying guy portals before they spawn then go for as many humans as possible  i think the main thing that always kills me is tunnel vision you have to pay such close attention to everything while playing
  very tiny piston engine
did dd  tower of doom and ghouls n ghosts recently both great games gng was much more fun though and much easier unsure of what to focus on next want to play a run n gun but it feels like ive already 1ccd all of the good ones im interested in maybe mystic warriors
  haahhahahahahahahaha
    ok so here is the difference between clearing one of my arcade games with one credit and clearing it with more than one credit z e r o
  so can you clear all the games you play on one credit right now then if theres no difference
   itt people claiming 1cc on games   itt things that never happened
  plays retro games and browses a retro game board  so clueless about arcade games and how to play them he thinks 1ccs are impossible  a 1cc doesnt even mean you put effort into a game necessarily the difficulty is a spectrum from trivial that can be cleared first try to insane challenges that will take months or even years
      can you    who the fuck cares rodrigo
   1ccs are impossible  they are for you compulsive lying autists all these threads over the years of 1cc never any proof why is that why so little proof when so many people are so good at arcade gaming on this board my fucking sides youre all absolutely shittier at gaming and lying is the only thing you tards know how to do but you fail hard at that too
  well i can give my inp files for both the arcade gng games if you want in fact i already posted one a while back when someone was questioning my clear there arent many people that 1cc games here though
  all my replays are on youtube  inps on pc  screen shots for every clear/score ive done    keep believing the mediocre achievement of 1ccing is impossible to feel better about how inadequate you are
    to be fair mame doesnt count i think the whole billy mitchell scandal shouldve made that clear
i hate the jrpg faggots on this board and i hate these guys too
  to be fairer neither does hardware unless its played at a nip game center and inps arent something that can be faked like a video
  mame is emulation real hardware isnt
ive never 1ccd anything but i want to try to ive really been enjoying radiant silvergun on my saturn recently and i think id like to be able to 1cc it eventually im still very bad at it but i love how its always clearly my fault when i die
  i recently 1cced twinkle star sprites i know its not big deal but i am still happy 1ccing arcade shmup  beside that in this month i 1cced vampire savior numerous times with aulbath gallon dimitri  3rd strike with urieni 1cc 3rd strike a lot it was my unconcious past time but now i have a friend with whome i play almost every week so i stopped doing that  1cced garou mark of the wolves with kain hokuto and one time with butt too but that was largely lucky game also with gato too  thats pretty much it in past few months  i am currently playing crimzon clover and also want to find some good arcade shmup that is not all hard but all the shmups that look really good are super hard and games on easier side are very shit looking
  i never managed to 1cc radiant silvergun on the default settings i can get to the final boss at least but hes tougher than the rest of the game i feel i guess if i come back to it ill need to figure out how to score better so i can level up my weapons that might help
  1ccing fighting games is super easy whenever someone talk about 1cc i pull this trump card desu i also get overwhelmed by people having so much 1ccs in games but if one like the game without ulterior motive like playing specifically for collecting 1cc you wont fail extremely hard   keep playing anon these things probably help people keep their sanity
  im truly terrible at it i cant even beat the second stage with the default amount of continues that it gives you but its so much fun that i actually see myself continuing to play it until i can do it    also i just want to confirm something while i have you on the saturn version of your game theres an option after you lose to save your progress and then when you start again you get to keep all of the weapon levels you had earned thats totally cheating right it sure feels like it to me im somewhat confused as to why its an option
  ive 1ccd it on arcade mode story mode is a lot worse because its over an hour long and takes longer to level up your ship
  the saturn version of your game  of the game
  keeping your weapon levels is fun to mess around with but for a 1cc it does cheapen the accomplishment like playing on very easy mode i was trying to 1cc arcade mode though the story mode is longer and even harder like  said
  1cc  whew lad real arcade games have no ending the only ending is when your frail meat cage collapses through exhaustion if youre good enough you can take quick naps before your extra lives run out
  darius leo not too difficult the awesome music helped currently working on cosmocop so i guess i am on a bit of an irem kick      you can do it dont credit feed just play through from the top as long as you are enjoying playing having fun you will clear it eventually and it feels nice    dont go for it if you do not enjoy playing the game though why waste your life with that enjoy it be proud when you beat your old high score and be proud when you 1cc it you can do it      1ccing fighting games is super easy whenever someone talk about 1cc i pull this trump card  do you play snk games or are you one of those konami only dorks      truth
  dat chart
  drugs wow im canadian and ripped out of my gourd that is my disability     fucking rtype leo and capcom holy crap
  why arent you asking for evidence of people finishing super mario or final fantasy over at those threads
  why is that dude wearing so much makeup
these arent arcade games but when i get bummed out i try to do another 1cc of wild guns reloaded on hard its a pretty short game and i can do it with some consistency though i dont play it with the gimmick characters theres no use playing for score because the game is so random with enemy attacks weapon drops and bonuses but i like the sensation of clearing through a game im familiar with i think the last time i did a 1cc was nex machina a while ago which isnt retro    every once in a while i feel like id want to get into shmups because of how much i like trying to 1cc arcade games but shmups seem like a really particular kind of experience and something about them just seems really boring looking from the outside so i never actually tried delving deep into one admittedly ive only ever lightly touched gradius rtype and mars matrix without really thinking much about them maybe ill really commit to one someday
  the only game i got close to 1ccing was splatterhouse reached final boss otherwise im too much of a shitter
  thats one of the games ive 1ccd i can do or at one point have been able to do a few but not many i get some sense of accomplishment from doing it but not enough that i obsess over it
  dont go for it if you do not enjoy playing the game though why waste your life with that  for sure man i took the funpill many years ago life is too short  and the amount of free time im able to take is far too little  for me to not make the absolute most of the time i have   you can do it  thanks
im chipping away at metal slug x  i was working on and almost had a 1cc clear of metal slug 2 until i learned that the real game has insane fps drop and the emulator i used didnt  im also fucking around with gunbird 2 and tengai
  no ive only ever done easier games like    fatal fury 1  contra  renegade
  whats so good about 1cc why not enjoy the game
  whats so good about sex why not just masturbate
  as if 1cc wasnt masturbation in this analogy     for 8 hours straight until your genitals bleed is the only way to really appreciate a videogame
  t virgin creditfeeder
  going for a 1cc is one way people enjoy playing games its fun to improve and setting the goal of 1ccing a game can make you appreciate it on a deeper level not to mention if you enjoy the game enough you might end up 1ccing it just as a natural consequence of playing it all the time of course if trying to 1cc games isnt interesting to you theres no problem with that either just play games the way you enjoy them
  it isnt about enjoyment its clearly about feeling elevated and superior to other people normalfags
  id like to know how many people got laid 1ccing a videogame do you think it would take one hand or two to count that high
  how someone can feel like theyre somehow superior to another living person by virtue of being good at an electronic entertainment toy is fucking baffling to me its like do you literally have nothing else in your entire life to be proud of this is it a video game i guess theres a point just past rock bottom where you can start to rationalize just about anything
  only if youre a faggot who comes on here and claims it doesnt count unless youve beaten the game without continuing otherwise its just a selfimposed challenge
  no its legit fun there are always fags that play games for selfworth but that applies to pretty much anything
  how can you enjoy a game when credit feeding and not working towards improvement its like playing with cheats on mindless
mindless  vr    sounds about right
    recently 1cced area 51 again with a friend    love that damn game its not actually that hard to beat on one credit once you get the hang of it but its still a fun ride
    1ccing vampire savior a harder challenge than most people realize i always play morrigan though
  two of the hardest psikyo first loops godspeed not sure about tengai but gunbird 2 is an awesome clear so intense and fun
    not about 1ccing but i have a friend you got laid because he beat some guys in a thps tournament no joke this girl was willing to fuck him because he was good at a video game they ended up dating for a while but she turned out to be fucking nuts no surprises there
  nahhhhhhhh its probably the easiest fighting game to 1cc because of super simple jedah ai i 1cced with wolf when i didnt even know push blocking but yes i admit i cheezed but still the the thing is his sweet spot was too obvious he just doesnot block in air for some reason or is always dashing so with dimitry he always eats my fireballs or with gallon my laser tackles and except first fight all people are quite close in difficulty wise jedah and second last fight just apply too much pressure dont get overwhelmed by them run them over and also be care full of morrigan turn around kicks they are hella annoying but you having problem is understandable morrigan is really weak to the point of unfairly weak even tho shes mascot of the series her counter part dimitry is quite okay strength wise  its a very fun game i wanted to get into it but its a little too dead and my friend stopped playing it with me too  with jedah always abuse his jumps and his air jedah bot is quite vulnerable there  in terms of final boss i fucking hate kof games kof bots are a breeze but boss compensate for all those weak peasants they are just too powerful fuck them i did manage to 1cc kof 2002 um on hardest i dont know how but krizalid was pretty okay probably becase hes pickable but softbanned so they didnt make exclusive boss version in that game  keep fighting
lots of them and not on emulator but on actual arcade centers back in the 90s  unlike the save stateabusing kids at /vg/ lmao  bbut practice isnt cheating  yeah no youre a zoomer fag who cant get good the way that was intended  also yeah im a dad now you can call me a dadshit if you want guess how offended i am by you calling me that lol
  by 1ccing vampire savior were talking about fighting oboro bishamon
  i have only fought oboro once but i have completed that game a lot of time hes just secret fight like q in 3rd strike  i also found out that in super turbo if you break current hiscore you will fight gouki in place of dictator so its almost impossible 1ccing that game on emulator because you will almost always break the default hiscore because they get restarted unless you are using hiscore extension on mame gouki is a fucking nigger  i managed to get to gouki in one coin with old ken and probably got one round too but thats pretty much it hes awful   another score for bragging coming through
  yeah i was asking because o bishamon is the hardest fight in the game if you get to him which requires not losing any fight  and while you can select him by simply pressing a button on the select screen on arcade version in saturn version its mandatory to beat him in order to select him
  youre a zoomer fag who cant get good the way that was intended  by spending money gotcha     i forgot some people actually think microtransactions is integral to gaming
  which ones
  i havent tried oboro but according to mizuumi wiki hes not all that good but i just checked the wiki and found out that hes banned from tournament play because hes not selectable in arcade so for consistency hes banned
  i love that your brain is so zoomered that you actually think coinops are microtransactions  theres another thing you didnt have into account observation  also youre still spending money when you emulate your parents pay the bills for electricity right microtransactions    my goto games when i went to the arcades were cadillacs and dinosaurs punisher and time crisis
  sunk costs fallacy
  watching others play and copying their strategies is perfectly ok  learning on your own with savestates isnt  lmao this double standard  when it comes to punisher did the owners let you mess around with the settings hardest dip switches make the game much more fun and challenging while defaults are too easy np doing this on an emulator
  he thinks actually knowing good players irl and learning from them is the same as cheating with save states  absolute fucking state of zoomers i love it  also my point about electricity bill still stands i dont regret spending nickels on playing real arcades back in the day i lived through it you didnt
  it isnt the same learning with savestates actually requires you to think and come up with your own strategies copying someones play does not
  learning  youre not learning youre just cheating  also observation back then was rare youd have to know which player was good and you had to really pay attention you couldnt go back as in a youtube video to watch the strategy in slowmo as many times as you wanted 
  well youre cheating in order to learn and nice excuses its ok when you do it right
  youre the one who was saying i was wrong because i had to spend money  and yes spend nickels i did most of what i learned was on my own but sometimes a few select good players would teach you really cool advanced tricks its how originally secret/special moves in fighting games were spread around word to mouth and people watching good players its part of arcade culture save states are part of a different culture
  and superplay dvds were what exactly how about strategy guides and magazines in general home ports with level select and builtin cheats typical boomer double standards
  dvds  i really love zoomers theyre cute  you lost zoomer theres little you can do here to redeem yourself  just accept that youre a savestate abusing kid who couldnt have survived in an arcade center back in the day
  oh shit a nitpick that completely invalidates a 100 legitimate argument that exposes you for being a hypocritical fag
  argument  thing is there is no argument  you stand on the zoomers fence defending save states and emulation and i stand on the og fence defending actual arcade culture the real deal  this is just friendly banter lil bro we arent supposed to agree
  and superplay vhs/dvds guides magazines and home ports with level select/cheat codes are part of arcade culture many of those trivialize games far more than savestates ever could face it boomer your entire argument boils down to it being more convenient to do the same shit people have been doing back when the arcades werent dead
  vhs  cute the zoomer learns  many of those trivialize games far more than savestates ever could  cute cute cute
  most magazines back in the day didnt really include indepth strategies for arcade games i only remember lists of special moves for fighting games at most  you clearly werent alive back in the 90s or at least not conscious  the only publications that had indepth strategies were fanzines and mostly in japan
  not an argument  also protip arcades werent universally popular in europe particularly eastern europe very few people had access to them im probably just a few years younger than you 27 yet even if i was in my late 30s that wouldnt make a difference since arcade centers just dont exist here i did grow up watching shit on vhs though
  its one of the easiest arcade 1cc i know of lmao morrigan is not that great of a character so that may be why its harder for you this guy is right 
      
  waah why did you actually live through the arcade era and i didnt i know ill post a picture of a funny ape hehe thatll show him
  zoomers doing the same with youtube get the same treatment btw
  i already 1cc the following  fantasy zone  metal slug and metal slug x  shinobi  contra  theyre all kind of easy except ms x but eh im actually surprised how shitty amd short contra is compared to the nes game
  back then  your gramps was pulling your leg when he told you that
  konami games were often better in their home ports jackal and tmnt were better on console too the original contra is somehow easier than the nes version on defaults but on hardest dips its much tougher and more fun in my opinion it even adds a lot of new enemies in levels super contra is pretty much a different game also not as good as super c but worth playing for the sheer intensity of it
i know its not retro but ive been pretty into zeroranger and im this close to a 1cc i can get to the penultimate boss on the second loop on a single credit soon    but if you havent played it if youre into shmups i highly recommend it im not usually into vertical shmups but this has a lot of mechanics i really like and the stage design is more in tune with what youd see in a classic horizontal shooter
  t cagar
  cagar means to shit in spanish
  indeed but  
  i lived through it i just didnt get my brain shrunk due to sunk cost fallacy paying a quarter for each attempt does not make it more genuine or valuable youre just the candy crush player of the 90s
    thats why i usually play as morrigan it makes it more of a challenge
  ssf2t
  youre just the candy crush player of the 90s  so this is what zoomers think of the original arcade culture funny you arent able to comprehend a different time without having to relate it to shit from your own childhood  just deal with the fact youre a cheatabusing faggot instead of projecting your insecurities on people who actually lived the days  i lived through it i swear  yeah you didnt  states your save
  that guy isnt a shmup player i see youre dumb enough to think that to feed into your derangement though lmao
  who talked about shmups save stating faggotry can be used in other genres too
  whatever arcade player
at the end of the day nobody should care how you learned how to play a game if you know how to play it at the end if a guy gets a world record after practicing with save states who would care i dont think anybody reasonable would think less of him or that his accomplishment is less valid
this is why i dont like arcade shit people have to make arbitrary rules about the games in order for them to be challenging with 1cc being only possible for savant spergs or cheaters who use save states to memorize the harder parts more easily the only arcade games that are reasonably 1ccable are fighting games everything else is bullshit
  go play omega fighter
  1ccs are completely doable without savestates savestates just make it more fun youre just a dumb cunt besides hand a tougher fighter to someone who has never played fighting or arcade games in their lives and sure enough theyll find it hard or even impossible if theyre a whiny retard like a lot of people here its all about building up the core skillset and the right mindset soon enough 1ccs become no big deal
   zone  did you use autofire and if not how are your fingers
  savestates just make it more fun
    i usually just set out with a certain amount of continues in mind10 or so and then try to beat the game like that
    sad thing is that these are likely to be the same person
  10 continues  absolute state of /jarpig/
this board has never had an arcade thread that doesnt revolve around dickswinging not a single one ever op never learns and keeps trying to initiate earnest discussion
  t only considers not dickswinging credit feeding 25 times to then move on to your main dish a jrpg and discussing the story and aesthetics
  does it still count if i used an emulator
  obviously unless you used tools during the actual run its all good
  i didnt game requires a lot of button smashing but otherwise its not that bad easiest way i found is to use the 7 way shot at all times after stage 4
  for your own sense of satisfaction sure but for any meaningful comparison to other gamers in terms of score it needs to be done on real hardware
  nope im  i understand that 1cc is the way to go  no save state scumming though
  no unless you play standing up leaning heavilly on a worn out joystick covered in someone elses cheeto dust while breathing in second hand smoke and having your eardrums shattered by machine speakers programmed to be louder than the competition youre not playing it as the devs intended     zoomer
save state practice is perfectly legit when youre learning a game at the end of the day youve still got to execute all of the stuff youve practiced on a single credit therein lies the challenge
  well jrpg fans are far superior in intelligence to arcade gamers you can tell because their thread is mostly on topic probably all that reading stimulates more mental activity than mashing buttons and relying on reflexes just to speculate if you just observe the level of writing in muh 1cc threads you can tell that playing any arcade game other than maybe ikaruga for extended periods basically causes brain damage
  save states to memorize the harder parts more easily    yeah its total bullshit when a musician practices harder parts of a piece before putting it together fucking cheats
my biggest accomplishment is probably dodonpachi daioujou but the second loop is way too difficult for me havent passed the second stage yet    working on ketsui right now
  it doesnt people compare scores between hardware and emulation to judge skill all the time as long as theres no confusion that it was done on emu very few people who actively play give a fuck its mostly /vr/ shitters that want to cling to some dumb hardware only elitism
  nice anon doj and ketsui are pretty tough especially to do consistently for the second loop reqs
  at the end of the day youve still got to execute all of the stuff youve practiced on a single credit  yeah but you still cheated to play a specific part over and over in a way original devs didnt intend it  i dont condemn save states though but just dont pretend to be skilled if you need it
  dont pretend to be skilled  hes skilled if hes skilled how he practiced has no bearing on the end result to understand how dumb this opinion is apply it to any other hobby
  doj is tough as hell and ketsui too i really want to clear a cave game but except deathsmiles all are pretty tough maybe mushi is okay but havent played it all that much also deathsmiles suck its aesthetics are really repelling   i am playing dodonpachi and thinking is second stage boss blue circles bomb random sometime he throw the second one really fast and sometime 3rd one is super fast are they just random or that depend on some other factors
  mushi original is newbie friendly so is ddp daifukkatsu 1all so is donpachi if you can clear the first ddp then espgaluda esprade and progear shouldnt be a big problem also which blue circle bombs probably random cave bosses are quite heavily randomized
  you couldnt practice that way on original hardware niggas who wanted to 1cc something back then had to waste hundreds of dollars
  nobody cares besides home ports were a thing many even had level select see ghouls n ghosts
  even the first midboss has randomized bullets      donpachi  it has horror elements though      listening to music to help you learn bro back in my day you only had sheets
  i should take a look at daidukkatsu and mushi they look good i was always really scared of cave games and arcade shmups the only cave game i can play or have fun with is dodonpachi all of the others look super scary and overwhelming but now is probably a good time getting them
  they give off that impression but when you get into them you realize theyre quite forgiving and are all heavily based on transferable bullet reading and movement skills for survival so spending some time getting good at one will make others much easier dont forget to bomb especially in ddp which gives so many bombs that you can use to trivialize tougher parts its stuff like psikyo and tatsujin that you gotta watch out for despite their appearance
whats your favorite

not /vr/ but pic related is a 2d metroidvania which couldve run on a snes so close enough
  after playing earth defense force none of the /vr/ approved games do it for me
wish there were more games with photorealistic bugs than that one cockroach adventure game
  developed by wayforward  neat ill give this a look
  not bugs

the only thing that bothers me on shinkiros art is the faceapp smile every character have
    you picked a quality image i like his art despite his crutch of photo reference and still want kof to look like a moving shinkiro painting      agree with this too
  yup
george clooney looks like a massive faggot
    good times
a wild vandamme appears
overall i was fairly disappointed in the selection / my hunting didnt bring a ton home but a few fun finds    main sources       book off    hard off    mandarake    what i was really looking for were hardware console colors that didnt come to the usa white sega saturn spice gamecube controller colors etc    wasnt a ton of selection was hoping to find big bins full of common controllers wasnt much of that
  i bought this club nintendo exclusive wii controller from japan and it fucking sucks mushy dpad and shoulder buttons ghost input signals on the dpad low quality looking and feeling parts on the inside  just objectively shit im glad i have a couple of the snes classic controllers because those are much better and this might be the worst thing ive ever spent money on
the lttp was 800 which i thought was pretty cheap skipped mario collection allstars for like 1800
  loose alttp cart is worth 500 yen max if both stickers are in near perfect condition clu clu land is 100 yen yellow saturn pad maybe 500 yen dc mouse in good condition is about 1000 yen boxed wii sfc controller 2000 yen overall mediocre haul tbqh      you were looking in the wrong places
    yeah i know it was a mediocre haul but i needed to bring something home with me    bought the only two cheap jdm controller colors i saw lttp was fine at 800 yen for a good game souvenir chu chu land was cheap and i mostly liked the orange cart    tips for other places    hardoff junk section was fun / ok but other stores like that would be especially good to know about for next time
    chu chu  clu clu
not super recent but i got all of this
i have a feeling there are some filthy resellers in this thread
  you wont find much because theres guys who scour every retro shop every day taking the best stock to sell to stupid gaijin on ebay
i found it weird that there were hundreds of perfectly boxed famicom / super famicom games there for not unreasonable prices much less than the equivalent would be in the states and better condition    and there were certainly some consoles/controllers more than the average usa goodwill    but there could have been more untested boxes theres seemingly demand for it      i saw hundreds of extremely niche guitar shops vintage american menswear shops computer parts shops where are the smallish vintage gaming shops
  where are the smallish vintage gaming shops  as if wed tell you where our gold was buried
i dont want the gold i just want the supply of ebayish prices but without intercontinental shipping    hard off prices were ok / fine but they just didnt have enough stock of common stuff
    ps post your finds / collection
got akumajo dracula x for 18 bucks recently thought it was a steal decided to get it found out its worth quite a bit more than i thought glad i grabbed it while i did    ended up buying paying 40 for a whole stack of fighting games too darkstalkers doa virtua fighter 12 fighting vipers etc
  ill give you a small hint as a favor to a fellow anon when i said earlier that you were looking in the wrong places i didnt just mean you werent looking in the right stores
does that mean neighborhood or outside of tokyo or what
where do i start
  from japan  mega supa cringe haul
    more a hit up a couple retro junk shops during a short trip and thats what they had haul
  buying toys in the land of the rising sun while you could just order them at home in this day and age  its like you guys just want something to brag about
  are you retarded or just a 
  more a spent all my leftover backpacker money on bargain bin shit at super potato haul  ftfy      its like millennials are narcissistic  mind blown11 すみません me profusely aporogize and bow many time because buy can coke in rocal convenience store instead of order from onrine book store me just thursday
  pity you  
i wanted to bring home like 5 spice gamecubes
i lived in japan for five years up until a few months ago the best place to get something i knew that i wanted was amazon japan if you dont have an address you can still use convenience store delivery or failing that general delivery at the nearest post office    book off has some gems but its really hit or miss i only buy stuff for saturn dreamcast and 360 so i dont have too much in the way of selection for ps1/2 obviously youre going to find much more and its going to be much easier for the real boomers out there looking for sfc and older youre on your own at this point the market for those consoles is essentially scorched earth at this point
  love the sg1000 collection makes me want to play some exerion right now
  awaiting 4 famicarts including bonks adventure and wacky races    oh and a spare copy of time zone    also had a dogbone controller from japan in standby
  its always amusing to hear stories about people who live in japan but can never find anything cheaper than youtube tourists i dont know whether theyre larping or just retarded i recently picked up a cib sfc and fc for 1k each and that wasnt some fluke i have about a dozen others i paid roughly the same for and a dozen loose i paid half that or less for
  congratulations now how about the games for it
  wow you found a console that sold millions for cheap fucking david dickinson over here
  theyd mostly be useless to you unless theyre imports      i found a lot of consoles and other stuff for cheap the point is that cheap stuff is pretty easy to find despite all the claims that it isnt im sorry that fact upsets you so much
  hes right though namefag
  im pretty sure the discussion at hand was about games not consoles any moron can find a famicom for cheap if you want any games for it though and particularly the ones that arent a dime a dozen youre dealing with a very different market indeed
went last year and this last week heres my haul from 2017
  and my haul from november 2018
    nice where did you cop
  nagoya osaka and tokyo the bookoffs and hardoffs in the osaka and nagoya suburbs are way more plentiful than tokyo for obvious reasons finding vintage soundtracks was a goldmine outside of tokyo proper
  fuck you i would suck your dick to get those twinsticks you son of a bitch
  also cost 1000 less than 10
  whats it like to be rich
  youd suck his dick without getting the twin sticks too hard to tell what the distinction youre trying to make is
    i like the first haul best but good to see that you mix cib and loose games    and whats the smw double cd the soundtrack a cd drama
  that i want those twinsticks i didnt think it was that tough to differentiate
  the first disc contains fusion jazz arrangements by soichi noriki and the second contains the original snes tracks
  nice what are the two msx games behind space manbow    want to go to japan so badly but unfortunately im a kid with not enough money and no excuse to go  if i were to ever go within the next 5 years it would be with my parents and it would be to my family in osaka  keeping track of all the arcades in the area just in case  but just because ive never been there doesnt mean i dont import a shitload of stuff
  nice what are the two msx games behind space manbow  iga ninpoucho 1 and 2 two simple arcadey ninja action games by casio
  i wanna play fray  i think im going to get the pc engine version
  i always hear people say to buy the jp version of games if the na versions are too expensive i dont really understand buying the jp versions of games if you dont understand japanese   i havent been there but im planning to go sometime after i graduate i only really plan to buy consoles as per my personal theory you can and always will be able to pirate software but you will never be able to pirate hardware
    how did you fit all that in your bag
  airline allows two checked luggage bags up to 50 pounds each you just bring one big luggage case and one smaller one you stack inside the bigger one then spread your clothes between bags on the return trip to cushion thw stuff you get
  mandarake was disappointing and a little hard to browse imo they have a lot of really niche stuff but you really have to know exactly what youre looking for     bookoff was cool although not really for retro stuff i did get shorthanded on a ds copy of pokémon white which later turned out not to work oh well
  i always hear people say to buy the jp version of games if the na versions are too expensive i dont really understand buying the jp versions of games if you dont understand japanese  naturally that only goes for games which are not very text heavy  a prime example is super metroid i believe the japanese version even has an option to change the language to english
  the implication is that you should just learn japanese lol
  pretty clear you want all three sticks faggot
  ill ship airmail i give no fucks
  thats what i was thinking would be better i mean have you seen what baggage handlers do to your luggage
i always get sick when i see eop scavengers like you here in japan
  this would have been cool but now its worthless because that is effectively the same as the snes mini controller now  same connector etc
  t fat gaijin who stares daggers at any foreigners who dare pollute his jap paradise
  those snes boxes    very nice
    im on the same page was really looking for hardware but an 800y lttp was hard to turn down as a pure souvenir / shelf piece
  i see eop scavengers  here in japan  if you hang out in the same places they do then youre no better than them douchechan
  thanks last one i really want is super metroid but i aint paying over 5000 for a supercommon game even if it is in high demand with filthy gaijin everything else there was around 980 under 10 and donkey kong 1 and 2 were closer to 500less than 5
  yeah the akihabara mandarake sucks for browsing anything especially games almost everything is behind glass or in a big fat protective plastic case like the games sometimes you can find something cool on the discount shelves that isnt in the cases but has already been priced i got a gi joestyle 1/6th devilman for about 22 but thats not very common the various mandarake stores in nakano broadway are usually less crowded and allow you to actually pick up merchandise and inspect it
  smw ape guide  scanbro never forget
my other parcel came this week wouldnt have bought so much but got a good price from a one seller very low auctions with little to no action
got 50 famicom games on yahoo auctions 15  a nontested famicom 4
  also got these for 20  waiting for a 10kg package full of saturn game shipped by sea so ill have to wait 2 months cant wait to play ssf2t on it
  princess maker 2 is such a great game
  yeah i picked up a mint copy of einhander for 15 the japanese version is even in english
 time crisis 4  terminator salvation cabinets got removed in my city    lets talk about one of the best and yet dying vidya genres ever during his golden age    hotd2 is still the best rail shooter game ever btw
  rail shooter
  why not tho 
    luckily i have a sega saturn with some light guns on the way its really sad that these old arcades are disappearing may have to buy some of these up
  indeed you are a lucky man what are your favorites 
    hotd of course virtua cop is fantastic but my favorite hands down is area 51 nostalgia probably plays a big part in it but its a really fun game
i love this game beat it with a dualshock idk if it would be as fun for me with a lightgun you have to be really precise
  lightgun would totally change your experience imo itd be funnier
off topic  what kind of gun is the time crisis gun  i dont know of any semiauto pistols that natively holds 6 rounds
    im not even sure theres an irl equivalent for it xd        arent lightguns only crtcompatible  i doubt someone struggled to port the drivers on pc or some shit you can still get an aimtrak or use a wiimote with a bt sensor bar tho
has anyone played lucky  wild happened to play it at an arcade once and it game was so good very fun coop game
  heh ive just seen some gameplay the game sure looks fun as hell
whats the easiest way to find gun games what are the best consoles for them  i have a dreamcast and ps2 gun but thats it i like the genre from what ive played but id like to explore it more
a guy nearby is selling pic related for 20  is it worth the price  also what are some good games to get for it  i plan on using it with my psone
  light gun games are the best genre the biggest tragedy of gaming is their decline and at this point disappearance modern tvs have only accelerated that which is a shame
  i forgot the pic
  i plan on using it with my psone  if you have researched how to hook one up to your psx time crisis is the only light gun game i own i know that hooking it up for users of svideo can be tricky it looks generic as fuck but the reload pedal is a pretty damn cool feature i prefer oem models over 3rd party but if you have access to games this may be a worthwhile purchase     
  not sure about europe but ive never paid more than 10 for an official namco guncon theyre not that popular     it gets tricky with nonguncon games there were tons of other 3rd party guns for the ps1 nykon i think made the most gunconlike ones
  i bought some guys huge ps3 move  gun accessory collection off of ebay for nothing the move was a pretty good gun platform even though it bombed obligatory not retro but with ps3 soft modding really moving theres the possibility of some cool emulator support along with ps3 shooters    ps3 and wii are your best bet for playing these types of games on a noncrt    its crazy the lack off pc options the best ones are 100 mame types of guns that were made 15 years ago
  cmon    stay low
  i think there are some mods involving a mouse
  wii clowns everything else at least as far as games that will still work on a modern tv
  my ps1 is chipped so i think i could just burn any games that interest me i never played light gun games except duck hunt so i really wanna try it  ill ask the guy for a price drop
  i bought an aimtrak it takes ages to dial in settings that work well but it does work with mame at least the downside is that youd think that any game that has mouse based lightgun aiming could be replaced with a gun that emulates a mouse but the reality is that things like m2 just dont behave  still its better than nothing if you dont have a crt
how come wii delivered absolutely nothing in regards of rail shooting games even a ps3 has the time crisis games or hotd 4    i know its not retro but otherwise good luck talking about rail shootan on /v/s current absolute state
  speaking of wii  i have a modded one  what are some good retro or non retro gun games for it
  i dont know if you could call them dying while not /vr/ persay the rechronicals games where epic fun i enjoyed resurvivor when it came out too hotd games are immense though a genre the wii was keeping rather alive and well
  resident evil chronicals my man check em out
  hotd 23  hotd overkill  ghost squad  umbrella chronicles  darkside chronicles  call of duty 4 and 5  medal of honor whatever
  a modded wii has access to a ton of homebrew shooters i cant recall the specific homebrew browser i used its been a while but you can find a lot there
  hotd overkill ghost squad hotd 1  2 remakes dead space extraction those resident evil games that were rail shooters and of course the excellent sin and punishment 2    it could have been better but to say there was absolutely nothing is not doing the wii justice
  wii does have hotd
  never heard of ghost squad desu but i played the rest and in my mind its where the wii excelled even re4 with the hybrid wii controls was great
    sweet sounds like i have some research to make  thanks dudes
  excuse me false information in this post hotd12 did not get remakes for wii and hotd1 is not on wii only 2 and 3 are
we really need hd ports of these games on the ps4/xbone especially the time crisis games they are too good to be faded away due to being crt games
  emulators with lightgun game are compatible so you have access to the entire zapper super scope and sega enforcer catalogue
  are joycons a viable way to play lightguns game wiistyle at least you can touch the screen
  yeahbut playing with those just doesnt feel the same as holding an actual light gun
  but light guns dont feel the same as holding a real gun either
  better than a stick
hey anons does anyone here have a dedicated light gun setup with one of those recoil light guns if so how do they feel i was just reminiscing about arcade cabinets like time crisis 3 that had them and they felt so satisfying to shoot
  i bet you could epoxy some pieces of sheet steel and get the gun feeling heavier at least
light gun games made fps games look slow
  fucking exactly this theyre one of the most fast paced genres ever and its a shame that gaming in general has allowed its fast paced arcade roots to decline even modern retro indie games are slow as fuck compared to the older games that theyre superficially copying
is there any way to use an old guncon on a newer television    i have the original time crisis point blank and point blank 3 but i cant play any of them because all of my old crt tvs have been discarded for one reason or another throughout the years
  super retro arcade neon has lightgun emulation in vr
if only i still had my crt i could easily hook up my gcon 2 in there and play me some point blank and vampire knight
      wii isnt comparable to lightgn games  lightgun games are fast and wiimote is like dragging a mouse in the screen  the experience isnt the same
we can emulate enhance and modify pretty much everything  for proper lightgungaymen you still need a cancer ray tube  whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
  cancer ray tube  please shut up
/vr/ would you play a cabinet shooter that had a metal gun with an attached co2 line to operate the slide each shot
  yes though it would have no commercial purpose as i doubt not even most of /vr/ knows how to hold a pistol
  have you ever held a heavy object at arms length for the duration of a rail shooter
  fucking lol  have you ever been to a shooting range
  light guns arent heavy at all
  i doubt not even most of /vr/ knows how to hold a pistol  aww why yes you are a big boy for not pointing the shooty end at yourself  heres a you as a way im saying im proud of you since golden stars arent a thing on here yet     keep up the good work champ 
i have time crisis 3 for ps2 with a pair of guns got it probably around 2004 shit is cash
  welcome to 4chans /vr/section enjoy your stay
favorite light gun
do any of you know of any services that repair defunct lightguns    anywhere
i loved playing the house of the dead 3 but then they removed it and replaced it with some shitty twd game with crossbows
  
  you can get lightguns working on and pc and use them for vr you can use them for any fps you want
  wii was the best light gun shooter system ever and nothing else even comes close
  you can get lightguns working on and pc  how
you guys need to get time crisis raizing storm on ps3 it supports the move and it has time crisis 4 arcade raizing storm and deadstorm pirates in the same package all of those games are ridiculous fun especially with another player    speaking of the ps3 it does have quite a few light gun games its a great system for the genre if you dont mind playing with the move controller
  how come wii delivered absolutely nothing in regards of rail shooting games  what the wii had an awesome renaissance when it came to them
  will look into it
  also interested in this
  hotd on the wii let you disable the cursor and sight in your gun it was best
can anyone here recommend a pc light gun for emulation
  also interested in this
  metoo
  you can use the touch on smartphones but of course that makes every lightgun game piss easy
  nes zapper of course the ping is timeless and its made from nintendium    guncon second because it has the best games
  maybe arcade services but thats hit or miss most arcade techs are not talking to you unless youre a business that can bring volume most light guns are silly easy in operation it would not be hard to repair the electronics yourself if you had a wiring diagram which one do you have and what is wrong with it
  using a touchscreen for light gun shooters    literally the worst way to play them
  arcade techs    are there people who actually work as arcade techs
  theyre lightgun games not rail shooters star fox is a rail shooter
    
  this guy gets it    technically the are still on rails though
    nah playing them with the controller is much worse
  yeah one of my local places had it for awhile sadly gone now it was a pretty fun game esp when you can get another player
  here ya go anon  of course the it doesnt really hold 6 but you know vidya
  great concept fun game
  this is bullshit it sucks but its not as bad as a touchscreen
  nes zapper will always be the most classic
yet dying  time crisis 5  hotd scarlet dawn  new ghost squad  alien covenant rail shooter  theyre not dying unless you count for homeconsole
  guncon 1 and 2 because theyre sexy though id have to say guncon 1 edges 2 out
    i think hotd 1 is still the best in the series maybe the best light gun game of all time
    area 51s scoring system is actually really good my only problem with it is not giving any indication of when youre going to be hit i think thats pretty important for the genre
    bro was always lucky and i was always wild classic little brother relegation    as a blog post oddly enough that dynamic still suits us in games hes better at more focused play im better at twitchy fast paced stuff
    the real shame is the amount that have been trashed because owners got tired of replacing crts used to be a guy on the wildwood boardwalk who kept a whole inventory of spare crts but sadly he went bust last year too the market doesnt want retro arcades so it gets too expensive i guess
  i remember trying to max it out no matter how hard i tried though i could never find the saturn exclusive bonus rooms
  alien covenant  isnt that just aliens armageddon with a different name slapped on the title screen
  i looked into it last year and your options are either to buy a 200 dollar aimtrak or just rig up a wiimote to work on your pc
  what city thats lame they selling them at auction
  hotd 23  oh jesus christ those were terrible in the arcade versions you almost instantly reload by shooting offscreen in that version you push a reload button and watch a reload animation that takes longer than unloading your gun the final boss of 3 is a special kind of hell thanks to the long reload not only does he take twice as long to kill and he was already a bullet sponge in the arcade but he has an attack where he sends a stream of attacks at you he fires far more shots than you have bullets so the reload animation gives you significantly less time to destroy them all    fuck that reload animation
  1 is brilliant but 2s ludicrous difficulty is so whiteknuckleintense that its impossible to not keep coming back to
  given how rare arcades are they might as well be dead if they dont come out for consoles
  implying its not duck hunt
  funny thing is in the xbox version of 3 you reload nearly instantly as soon as you fire your last shot without even having to shoot off screen though you can either press a button or shoot off screen to reload early without a long animation to be clear which honestly doesnt have a lot of use in 3 since the auto reload is so fast and you can unlock 2 by beating 3 which uses the classic reload rules as well as reloading via a button the same animation/speed as shooting off screen im not sure about the others but on the lightgun i have the thrustmaster beretta the reload button is along the grip so you just squeeze the grip to reload
  is that on the original xbox
  the fuck are you talking about most of the games he mentioned are so fucking common that you can find them at greyhound stations the only one that isnt is hotdsd and only because dave and busters bought nearly the entire initial stock so they put one in every store and the recent ghost squad but mostly because of how new it is
  did i say xbox 360 did i say xbox one was house of the dead 3 released for either of those consoles do those consoles even have light guns think anon think
  you do know a lot of the light gun games on wii support hiding the gun cursor right
    yeah but is innacurate as fuck    by no means is comparable to aim like pic related lightguns are something totally different
  nigga where the fuck do you live that they have arcade machines at bus stations
  here in america if you travel crosscountry by bus around 2/3 of the stations will have small arcades ive never ever seen one that didnt have at least one light gun game ive run into the original house of the dead welcome to frightfearland paradise lost time crisis 4 and 5 terminator salvation aliens armageddon target terror censored and uncensored ghost squad evolution and some others that arent coming to mind at the moment how recent the games are varies from town to town though clevlands gameroom looked like it hadnt been touched in over a decade while others are loaded to the brim with raw thrills shit
found house of the dead 4 cabinet in my city which is incredible since we dont have any culture of arcade gaming like at all zero  oh and have any of you played blue estate i think this is the most recent rail shooter
does anyone have an idea exactly why light guns wont play ball with my profeel it must be something to do with the glass cover in front of the screen but could it be reflections or a certain nonvisible wavelength of light being blocked by the smoked glass    the gun will register if i press it right up to the screen and this happens both with playstation/2 and saturn consoles in ntsc and pal
  arent projection tvs actually pretty bad for retro gaming i had a thing for them until i discovered the image quality isnt very good as well as the viewing angles
  not that guy but i dont think projection tvs even work with light gun games
  gonna go out on a limb and say the front plexi is messing with it somehow maybe try in a pitch black room sweet set btw
    maybe but this isnt a projection set of any sort but a direct view crt 1983 vintage and as straight sd as they come      yeah thats my thinking too its real glass btw not plexiglass about 1/4 thick and probably weighs 15lbs on its own as mine is the 27 rather than the 20 in the google pic i posted i do have a 20 too but its currently out of action due to a power supply fault
why did light gun shooters dry up on consoles in the 16bit era despite getting bigger in arcades was it just because of not including a light gun with snes and then when they did have one sold separately it was that pantsonhead retarded bazooka bullshit
is time crisis the overall best light gun shooter series
  not house of the dead
  i love the early ones like time crisis 1 and 2
  i wanna coomay inside that tv and reproduce smaller tvs from it raising them and making them larger
  me again  i got the gun today and tried it a but before heading to work  works great its basically brand new the guy never used it  its missing the gcon adapter so im stuck using composite for now  anyway im happy i got it    quick question  will it work if i hook it up to my ps2 and play psx games of the hdd
  wow thats fucking cool
  i wasnt expecting you to come back i woulda posted sooner i have the same gun and it is my favorite ps2 light gun     yes it will work on ps2 i play time crisis 13 and crisis zone on a ps2 fat with free mcboot it works great    the worst thing about it is sometime if you are swapping between certain games with specific gcon compatibility you may have to be patient with the side switch    pro tip you dont need the gcon adapter i believe that gun come with a yellow t shaped input one end is male and the other end is female correct plug the male end of the t input into the green socket and then plug the green component input into the female end of the yellow t shaped input you should be able to play component that way     again be patient with the inputs because sometime the color wont look right if they are plugged in just right but you should be fine i havent used my gcon adapter in ages    please report back 
  nice timing man i just got home from work  i would have come back sooner but the guy selling the gun took his sweet time to answer me and i kinda gave up on it then he unexpectedly wrote me while i was gone on vacation to tell me he still has it    anyway im happy to know it will work on ps2 ill load it up on its hdd i also have a fat with mcboot and play it there the psx takes a while and a few restarts to boot up a burned disk still need to fix that somehow    i believe that gun come with a yellow t shaped input    yes it does its how i connected it to my monitor i plugged in the composite video input  good to know it works with component since my ps2 has component cables i wanted the adapter so i can use the svideo cable on the small one    ill mess around with it later right now i need to get some rest    thanks for the helpful tips
  you have to use a ps2 controller to scroll through menus unfortunately the dpad on the controller will not function in this manner     other than that you should be good to go
  you have to use a ps2 controller to scroll through menus unfortunately the dpad on the controller will not function in this manner    i fucking hate when they do shit like that
  hdtvs dont work with light guns because they display shit differently and the light gun wont be able to detect the shit it needs to detect its why all old light gun games used to come with a disclaimer that they wouldnt work on projection tvs same issue with them displaying shit differently
i think you replied to the wrong person  thanks for the you tho
    unless you misread hdd hard drive as hdtv
what  says is probably correct but i thought id add that the cheap components they used in the consumer versions of the guns are really bad at picking up the scan lines many crt tvs have lost a good chunk of their peak brightness by this point and the guns dont work so well  monitors are especially bad with the dreamcast guns i suspect due to the sharper scanlines registering less light on the photodiodes    tldr use a dark room turn up the brightness and hope for the best you may be out of luck
  traditional sd crt based rear projection does work but its a brightness issue rear projection is usually quite dim and the consumer guns are not sensitive enough the deluxe arcade cabs use rear projection with their guns they just obviously designed the pickup system to work with the poorer light levels
  i dont know man now that i think about it there is this big divide between fantasy shooters and realistic shooters that one police trainer game and time crisis are tight as hell with a easy to play hard to master feel hotd area 51 carnevil all have gimmicks i think i like the tighter game play stuff better because im a drab faggot i always loved that pump shotty in carn evil but holy shit in the 90s every cab shot 2 inches to the left and down and now in the fucking barcades in 2018 its the same fucking thing 20 years to learn how to calibrate the stupid thing and they still cant do it right my blood pressure is going up just thinking about it i will never drop a quarter in that game and have it be fair
  how the fuck is time crisis not a fantasy shooter or even realistic in any way
  maybe he meant virtua cop
  they clearly did
  thats as far off as anything so i dunno
theres no reason why this genre shouldnt make a comeback on switch
  pretty much died with the wii didnt it there were a couple for that ps3 remote thingy and thats all she wrote
  i hope so this and beat em ups are amongst my favorite genres  i think that there may be an opportunity in systems with motion sensor addons the switch in particular because in addition to playing on the go by touch screen or controller you can still use a motion controller as it acts as a home console aswell i noticed the arcade market still releases light gun shooters relatively recently they can be a big attraction still
  seems like it unfortunatelythere were about4 arcade ports for the ps3hotd4 deadstorm pirates time crisis 4 razing stormi guess you can count hotd3 and mcdog mccree 1  2 aswell but compared to the roster of lightgun games the ps2 had it is scarce if there is one console i could have hoped it would have taken off with is the wii yet still pretty much died on the home market
  youre not from italy are you
  is it just a brightness issue i always thought they didnt display shit the same way as regular tvs and therefore the light guns couldnt detect the images correctly
  ive been reading the whole thread and i only got confused once i got to this post who is this responding to
  i was replying to   
  well thanks for the response lol
  i picked that up randomly back in the day i love it too i love the name
  not that guy but ive never cared for those nonsensical japanese engrish names
duck hunt is still the best light gun shooter ever
  imagine being stuck with this tacky shit on your back for the rest of your life    hipsters really are deranged
  redundant statement is redundant
  tfw i will never own a point blank arcade cabinet 
  those were fun as fuck on ps1 probably one of the few light gun shooters that i remember people actually playing at parties
  can these games ever come back on modern low latency super right led tvs
  newfag here  can i play ps1 lightgun games on a ps2 with a guncon 2 or do i need to have a guncon 1 for them
  the latter
what are some good late 90s japanese games something that gives off similar vibes to evangelion or flcl
speed power gunbike and love and destroy are absolute must plays and you dont need to know the language at all to enjoy
sin and punishment and jet set radio  from the year 2000 but still retro
can you read jap gunparade march but you need to know japanese
ive been looking for something exactly exactly like this for the last month or so
panzer dragoon saga kinda feels like this
evangelion 64 hehe
uhh earthbound
  not mid 90s
desu this is umihara kawase     
yumihairuh kaways is the best game on the snes
pedophile bionic commando
  bionic commandos physics suck ass
  at least its not pedophilia
  aww yeah look at that sexualised little hoe
so many threads about this game must be good  loved hook mechanics in little big planet games  check kawase on ds  its extremely slow and boring as fuck the physics are fucked up
  maybe dont play the bad version
  which one is a good one
  snes one or any of the 3 games that are on steam
  check kawase on ds  play snes version not that ds shit do you even retro brah
i just finished this for the first time a few hours ago feels good man
  thats cause youre shit and it takes some skill unlike the baby tier grappling in lbp
    you are both retarded the ds port is fantastic
  you mean all the routes and levels
  umihara kawase journey  its a romhack that some 4channers did that you can go through all levels in order no matter what door you take also starts you with 99 lives so you have plenty to practice with    umihara kawase uku is a romhack for more skilled players  its pretty fun but you at least have to know the basics of the game
  is this a meme or do you all legitimately hate this game
    no one actually ever jerked off to this game rright im just gonna pretend the answer is no
  encouraging child abuse  disgustang
  you mean all the routes and levels  no no no just one route through to the end which took me quite a few days i dont know if its the hardest or the easiest its just the one i chose  000102101112364550515657  only faced two bosses the seahorse and the crab
  you aint done anon not by a long shot its like 1/5 of the game and that route avoids the tough levels entirely
  which is the hardest one then now i have a bit more confidence i can go through the rest of them
  been a while but basically anything that ends with fields 42 and 43
  so basically the route that goes through the most possible number of fields
  pretty much though not because of the quantity field 42 is really frustrating and very hard to do with any amount of consistency and 43s pretty much guaranteed to kill you unless you know exactly what the level is
  ill give it a try then thanks
    do you ever grind out levels to prepare for a tough part of a retro game
pretty much every nes rpg ive played ive done that yeah
  every single jrpg/crpg that came in the 80s  90s diablo more so but thats because finding better loot was nore important at that point      also nice the second parts out
    who did  sa
  yes the translator said he would do the rest
what happened in season 20  not only did arino clear pretty much every single game most challenges were done while it was still light outside with minimal challenge shown at all times  and even when things got a bit harder altered beast and chou aniki to name 2 he was immediately granted permission to use level skips extra lives and difficulty adjustments something that until then had only been granted at the very last hour as a desperate measure  though its hardly better in the other cases where the game is simply so easy/allows infinite continues that not even that ends up being required    it was so unsatisfying altogether  is it because of ootsuka  they mentioned it was his first time directing but surely he wasnt given complete authority over what games they should have chosen right
  arino is getting old enough to enjoy some of the perks of japans seniority system you see it all the time gradually shows become less hard on the talent an obvious example would be something like gaki where matsumoto routinely sits out on anything vaguely tiring and all the bats are foam shit you couldnt kill a fly with
  where matsumoto routinely sits out on anything vaguely tiring  but thats not because of seniority  he had to skip for two years because of a muscle rip in his leg that just wouldnt heal  the problem is that the whole mastumoto sitting in a cage bit was so well received that they kept going with it forever like everything that ends up working in gaki  besides if it was really a matter of seniority then hamada would be allowed much much more    i really doubt the gccx thing is something like that especially considering season 21 isnt nearly as easy
  at least for altered beast the option screen is part of the game and arino found it and wanted to see what he could change this isnt something new with games like tonosama no yabou they allowed him to switch to max lives and max continues pretty much right away altered beast is just too lenient in what it offers the player to change
  the other times such a thing was possible they only changed it like once though or forbid its use altogether  with altered beast they were changing options at every single level ending up with boring firsttry victories left and right
      i thought the negotiations with oosuka in altered beast were some of the most entertaining parts
i hope he gets to beat zelda 2 he deserves to
  didnt yamasaki get some lenience that time he just recovered from something stomachrelated or something before a new year special too i might be remembering wrong though its been a while
  he did it was during the hospital batsu
this picture was posted in the previous thread anybody know what its from looks like one of the yoikos desert island life specials but i never heard of any of those being subbed
  what are you talking about theyre all subbed
  thats news to me know of any links to them by any chance
my favorite thing about gccx is that arino bothers playing video games that he cares and commits to trying to beat each one it is something i see less and less of nowadays even within myself
  most of the older specials are from ougon densetsu cocoricos show there are recent annual specials they have done for new years programming as a standalone
  japanese comedians are very dedicated people
king of dragons today  fuck i love that game
not intentionally fleeing from every battle so you arrive at every boss underleveled and undergeared to make the game a challenge
huh what a strange goof in the last episode when arino plays space fury in the arcade segment the subs say hes comparing the game to asteroids but arino is actually comparing the game to astro robo sasa a game he challenged way back    weird
so zelda 1 in a little more than a year    i would honestly prefer links awakening even if they dont do many gb games
  zelda 1 feels a bit too explorationheavy for the show
  the same problem happens in season 21 hes just getting too good at games doesnt help that 90 of the games hes playing are platformers
  he does beat it
  sa sucks a dick so its not really that weird
      also wondering about this
who is the best ad and why is it nakayama
  you know i love nakayama but if it came out he was a cannibal pedophile and had walls full of corpses i would not be surprised in the least not saying i think he is i just wouldnt be surprised     hed be great as the lead in a human centipede 2 type movie
where are the dvd special challenge raws  i can only find the subbed versions of 1 through 7 but i cant find the raws past that
  sa sucks a dick  its weird how that place is still around its like the internet equivalent of zombie simpsons
  doesnt help that 90 of the games hes playing are platformers    ive been saying this for a while they should diversify the games fewer fc and sfc games more games from ps ss pce start incorporating dc and then in a few years ps2 fewer platformers more exploration and horror games i really want to see him do all the ps resident evil games as well as silent hill more shooting games     does anyone know if theres any censorship for the show i know they did biohazard for dvd special only can they broadcast m rated games the sfc games with gore and violence they have done are trated and have hard to see pixel gore dont they show super violent anime late at night     would doom and other fps work for the show i know a lot of japanese dont like them because they have too much motion sickness i think doom ps final doom ps and doom 64 could be great
  yeah they want to keep the show as a family show so no m games outside of dvd extras it has to do with the image they want the show to have not with the timeslot it airs in
      i dont think the higher clear rate has anything to do with the genres hes playing  its because theyre allowing cheats infinite continues and stage selects from the getgo whereas once they would be right out banned right until the end  theres also a weird amount of episodes where they right out say arino you gotta film this other program after this and the episode shifts from lets see if he can clear the game in 14 hours to anythings fair as long as we clear before the other filming starts
    they could continue biohazard and silent hill for dvd and br specials then i really want to see them tackle those anything 3d with a big map     technically theres trated horror games theyve tackled already like clock tower and nosferatu but i guess the gore isnt too extreme
  speaking of the dvd extras where can i find them
  would doom and other fps work for the show  kan has said no to first person games because arino whirling around like a drunk is going to make for terrible tv and potentially cause motion sickness
  266 raw stream/download mp4    109gb 720p 60fps        the mkv guys should have theirs up soon if anyone prefers them i assume 267 will also be up soon
so how often do they fix the broken ddl links most of the ones i want to watch are dead my isp is evil and im unable to torrent and no i wont pay for a vpn
  you can literally just google the name of the episode you want and find a ddl somewhere
    267 raw stream/download mp4    739mb 720p 60fps        the mkv guys should have theirs up soon
    someone should just make a collection of these theyre great
arino is a reifag  and i thought he had taste
  there have been some really neat eyecatches the king of dragons one looks especially nice and colorful

i still feel bad for that dudes sticker collection
  is there any decent place i can watch it online i dont have an external harddrive and its starting to get full
  nope just a bad copy of the correct one proven by the lateness that followed the correct 266
ゲームセンターシーエックス 課長on
  nope
  internet archive has a few episodes some of which you can stream
dont they know what a flanged mace is
    entirely possible they dont its a euro medieval themed weapon
the snacks and headbands are prominently displayed on the table those are sponsors right     also does gccx have proper commercials the show seems to be about 56 minutes no time for those
can you recognize arcade boards
  looks like a system16 board or older
  sega system 1 board
  yep
  maybe choplifter or wonderboy
  ザ闘牛  they dont play games with home ports in kibanya
  who is they
  arino and team
  yes he does ive seen him do it you dont know what youre talking about man this thread is full of fucking idiots nonstop
  are you talking about sf1 having c64 and spectrum ports nobody gives a shit about those the point of the segment is unported arcade games
  well he gets paid for it
  yeah thanks to them we have most of the show translated
  the usual gccx episodes are on a pay channel there are no commercials during those just a couple minutes of network bumpers and stuff after the end
    so thats why they put the product placement in the show
  its actually a pretty low budget show im sure they have some arrangements like that
toujima is my husbando
how do these eps even make it to the net does an english guy live in japan and captures the eps as they play
  only the /vr/ is for fags encoder and the false flaggers on his side actually post here he used to throw tantrums in these threads every few months for several years and harassed people in emails thats why a lot of people ignore him
  ah i should have known better i wont reply next time thanks anon
  theres a bottleneck at the moment with like three people producing raws from the same source
  theres a bottleneck at the moment with like three people producing raws from the same source    what happens if an episode is shown only on tv and never is released on dvd or br
  if the source captures it from tv and distributes it then people can make their raws from it
  literally no full episode has been released on dvd the dvds contain material from episodes not full episodes
    ignoring dvd only episodes
  those are never shown on tv and dont follow the same format as the tv episodes anyway
would metal gear and 2 be worth it for the show
  based kacho
  msx isnt one of the platforms they use
    they did a little msx for segments in season 18 probably wouldnt do an msx game for a whole episode
  
i havent watched the new episode yet but ive been giving king of dragons a try now and the game is seriously pretty hard i made it to the final boss once but i cant seem to repeat it  if arino beat it im impressed
geimu sentaa shi ekkusu
  kachou on
  managed to beat it with the elf before watching the episode maybe i shouldve tried more with the wizard instead he looked pretty good some of the bosses were a pain with the elf    should probably learn where those continues are too that was my primary issue
  kek
  so how often do they fix the broken ddl links  never it seems pic related  if youre looking for direct downloads theres some on here    
    absolutely based
  they mess up game titles a bunch i think it was the vice project doom episode where arino says an area reminds him of akumajo densetsu and they just translate is as castlevania rather than the correct castlevania 3 or draculas curse or whatever but at least they got the franchise right that time
  literally no full episode has been released on dvd the dvds contain material from episodes not full episodes  wait what  then why buy them
you think sa will release something tomorrow
  no chance in hell
  no
hardsub
  sub  fixed that for you
i want suuuubs whys there no subs fuuuuuuuuuuuck
  obligatory lol at eops post
  yeah the mods usually wipe posts that just shit on things /v/style while adding nothing of value to the conversation
i guess the announcement for next week will be late again
whats the episode where he goes to the indoor fishing place
  i think that was 57 bikkuriman world
  the site was apparently a few hours late its up now  ranma 1/2 pc engine cd
  been giving it a try really really excellent presentation really really horrendous gameplay
  i just said the gccx threads here are a loop of booo no subs yaa new subs  these subs suck because muh superior japanese why no subs lets discuss learning japanese on a retro game board
  i just said  that mods should delete the threads on sight    wow i wonder why they hit you    so terrible poor you
wait what i clearly remember keeping your levels when you die what gives
    oh this is totally different in the western release this pretty much forces you to level up evenly if so why even give you the option the na release lets you more or less pick anything you can get 8 attack first before touching anything else     this and a bunch of other tweaks i feel the na version is superior to the diskdrive original
  thats what it looks like to me at least well probably get kaga dressed as the jusenkyo guide for this episode
i noticed the dialogue used the words arcade here and not game center or gecen what gives does game center and arcade have separate meanings
arinos smarter than me i never thought about doing this
  arcade is not a word nor is game center game a phrase you play arcade games at a game center
  wikipedia  the term arcade game refers to a game for a forprofit game machine arcade game machine back in the day it primarily referred to pinball but electromechanical games existed as well as computer games became more and more common both the number of titles and the profit gained from them increased heavily the english language has words like penny arcade and amusement arcade
    the exp required for each level is much lower in the japanese version so you originally gained levels at a much faster pace  but yeah its a bit wonky
    managed to beat it its one of those games that are obnoxiously hard until you realize how to cheese them then they become really easy that downiii move is stupidly overpowered and pretty much every boss can be destroyed easily by just spamming it over and over while any troublesome normal enemies like cologne on the final level can be skipped by just saving genma tokens for them    im pretty sure arino will beat it though he might need to get some pointers from the ads on how to play cheap
anyone else notice sa still hasnt even updated their own site with zelda pt2    also any idea on when we might get the pt3 mini ep
  i called a game center an arcade once and the japanese person i was talking to didnt know what i was talking about they dont say arcade to refer to a place where you play video games
  i remember beating this game 20 years ago guess you needed a television show to introduce you to it
  as a fan of the franchise ill say its absolutely a decent experience lots and lots of fully voiced cutscenes adaptations of key stories from the early parts of the series and even the full opening and ending themes the gameplay is a mess but a lot of love went into the presentation and it mustve felt amazing at the time
childhood is watching just arinos challenge segments     adulthood is watching the entire show
arino playing wario land when
    the na version just seems better overall the leveling system is easier and more flexible theres color coding for the levels the only thing missing i think is the monster roars but those were heavily compressed and not that impressive     
  iirc the sa team doesnt run that site a fan does i kinda remember him posting he didnt want to update links because he moved to japan
just watched part 1 of adventure of link it was way funnier than i expected it to be  so this is a 3parter
  every game they play on gccx can easily look this good during gameplay footage  instead they filter it and upscale it with digital block fuzz shit
  they want to be as authentic as possible i guess
  im using a filter there though
ever doubting abe
when do you guys tend to watch gccx    saturday morning gccx with a nice coffee is great
  i tend to watch it in the evening
  night it is a night time show after all
        yoiko at nintendo live 2018 in about half an hour anybody watching
today is gccxs 15th anniversary 
  who watches just the challenge some of the best content is in the arcade trips like arino hooking the rack in that fish hook game
watch the magical quest starring mickey mouse episode  had to beg for them to allow using a disney game in the previous season  they also didnt allow putting arinos face over the protagonist as it is customary  fuck disney the fact that this company still exists and keeps growing disgusts me
  damn it anon look what youve done now theyre coming for you  
  theyre so much bigger than most people could possibly ever imagine its disgusting
  the only good tamages are the ones where arino visits real arcades the candy shop/random restaurant that happens to have a couple of games tamages are nothing more than stale filler
  i tend to watch it while taking a huge dump
  friday night eating something tasty    though now it reminds me of my ex and cant stand to watch more than 20 minutes at a time
oddworld games would be perfect for gccx cinematic platformers make for great eps theyre basically puzzle games in platform form     has anyone sent in that suggestion
  no that would be too predictable  arino compares it to prince of persia since its a cinematic platformer  he gets decently far solves a few puzzles with skill  gets stuck somewhere ads bail him out  beats game  bad end nani  staff tells him he needs to save all to get the real ending  time is already up he gives up  challenge failed  if the game didnt hide them in fucked up locations you pretty much need a guide to find then maybe but as it is it would just be watching arino get to the bad ending
   game   end nani   tells him he needs to save all to get the real ending    theres the bad ending the good ending and then the perfect ending you dont have to actually save all of them to get the good ending perfect ending is like new game perfectionist shit     you just need 45 to get the good ending they can tell arino this early on to avoid this they could even keep a counter in the corner and keep track of those saved or killed     you sorta have to go out of your way to kill or ignore mudockens to actually get the bad ending     arino compares it to prince of persia since its a cinematic platformer  he gets decently far solves a few puzzles with skill  gets stuck somewhere ads bail him out    also happened with nosferatu and it was a great ep and great game
  they tend to not tell him stuff like that though in kirby 64 they never told him he needed to collect star pieces until it was too late
    yeah i think that could still work 45 is pretty damn easy to get too they could just reload an old save and he can go from 30 to the needed 45
  whos this faggot
  nobody
  the face of a man about to be fired
season 22 episode 13 269 ______man premieres on thursday november 22nd    ill guess rayman
  batman
  yakuman for the gameboy
  ultraman
  that was episode 21 unless they suddenly play ps2 games
  kinniku or moai cant tell what you so called weebs are trying to convey
  shitman
  rockman
  theyve done several rockman games including the original they just did x2 this season
  how amazing would this be
should we take it as a bad sign that sa still hasnt updated their official gccx sub site    seems like they care even less than normal about gccx    also any word on getting that last little pt3 of zelda clip soon
  its not run by sa its run by some other faggot so no
  best is inoko max
  theres more than a handful of ultraman games on the playstation though
when will gccx get the dedicated fansub group it deserves
  you dont deserve it
still no raws anywhere  seriously theres usually some floating around on dailymotion by now
in season 1 did they stop visiting companies after capcom in episode 3 i can only find short gameplay segments after the third episode
  check the 2015 torrent if its still around some retard made an updated torrent in 2017 that cut all that out for the sake of adding two new episodes
  the only thing i can find is an unseeded torrent for season 1 all the files in the batch torrents look like something on the right in pic related with cut episodes full episodes exist if the unseeded torrent left picture is to be trusted
  those short gameplay segments are tv nihon guess subs you dont want to watch those
  lol its true though sa does suck balls but anyone who reads these threads can see clear as day that most of the fans of this show are pieces of shit so yea be happy with what you get
  i dont know why the unseeded one on the left would be labeled as translated im pretty sure thats an old torrent of mostly raws the 2015 batch torrent in the ops downloads is seeded and looks like it has the subs from both teams who have worked on that season    if you look at the ops episode list youll see that four episodes and the special at the end are the only season 1 things with complete subs so far the rest are partials with just the challenges subbed
  i really wish theyd do the rest of the s1 episodes theyre really fascinating to watch after all these years
  same
  when its a legit living
this has to be the most obnoxious password system in any game
  check dragons lair on snes
is there some streaming website to watch this aside this one  ive already seen everything from the latter
something awful is cancer
does anyone just watch the tamage segment
  but ill keep watching their releases
  doesnt stop the million other fansubbers from doing their shows nice try though only losers with no lives and way too much time on their hands sub things for free i bet the real reason this shit takes so long is because the goons are too busy sperging over politics on twitter they could be doing something productive but theyd rather cry about trump 10 hours a day
  million other fansubbers  oh no no no no no  look at this dude
has arino ever played through murasame castle
  at the end of season 18 not subbed yet theres an episode list in the op
second episode of adventure of link is so much better than the first
  did you somehow miss the last 8 years of fansubbing dying out almost completely
  
  dont know if you were still looking but the op put ranma 1/2 raws up over the weekend
  already watched an assy youtube upload that had a huge 10 minute cut in it i guess ill grab whatevers in the op too
when is someone going to archive every single subbed gamecentercx its really hard to find links to some episodes and everything is scattered all over the internet most of the links are either dead or seedless torrents
  2015 batch torrent in the op downloads is seeded theres also instructions for converting dead torrent links to ones that work on nyaasi    i think anything newer than the 2015 torrent is in the latest subs
if the guys who were going to reupload the lemming 24 hour special are here i again thank you for doing it
ive started watching the series this summer and am currently at season 15 i want to make an image which showcases all ads and has descriptions related to them pic related is what i made id be grateful if i got some suggestions because i dont know what else to put for a lot of these ads im only satisfied with nakayamas and toujimas segment
    thats what the ads do in the show but its not what their role actually is theyre literally production assistants for the show every show has ads including everything else at fujitv the difference is that gccx is a tiny show and all the cast is literally the production crew plus arino     theyre all junior production people and ad isnt meant to be a job forever they typically move on to other positions at fujitv
    yuko watanabe is straight up one of the directors of the show now she also sings some of the songs you often see her behind the camera
  thanks for the information ill change that on the image any suggestion for other things for example what should be said for katayama etc      thanks ill add that she sings some of the songs and that shes often seen behind the camera
  you forgot the part where inoue got carried away on the live stream and got chastised by the fans he also lives in a apartment doesnt he
  in a weird apartment    they did that terrible gory/terrible death segment with him
  the pictures are awfully small imo too much blank white space    and inoue wrestled in college not high school
  you forgot the part where inoue got carried away on the live stream and got chastised by the fans  can you remind me what exactly happened also im not sure whether the fact that he was with arino in one of the segments should be on the image
  it was one of the 24 hour challenges where he had his own segment so that arino could have some rest away from the camera or whatever he acted pretty cocky and full of himself in those segments like he was already a recognised professional despite only recently having graduated from being ad and someone faxed in a message saying dont get so full of yourself inoue
  i dont recall that at all does that happen sometime after season 15
  nope it was one of the special challenges before season 15
  they only did one 24 hour challenge for lemmings i think what youre thinking of was when inoue did his beat takeshi impression during the live takeshis challenge before season 11 that challenge was only a couple hours long
    actually that might have been in the live pilotwings challenge near the end of season 15 im not totally sure that one was pretty long
    it probably wasnt 24 hours but it was one of the long challenges at least long enough to warrant the fax wall
some anon was asking for a rip of the full lemmings 24 hour footage from some jap website    
  and here is my 24 hours lemmings i got from a batch torrent years ago          
    i dont know what seasons watanabe is a codirector for i remember seeing her briefly in some of the game center sections and arino keeps mocking her in various games i remember her in nosferatu thats season 17 2014 i think shes still a director for the show that plus the songs does she sing all of them make her one of the more important people on the show
  and heres a sp episode that was in the same folder  
  she sang sayonara game for when a bunch of the staff were leaving i forget if she sang anything else she came back as a full director when season 17 started
      you guys are the best i finally bagged my white whale after all these years  thanks again
  isnt tsuruoka the one abe hated said he slept all the fucking time was lazy as hell something about falling asleep during the 24hr live quest of ki challenge or something
  the one abe hated was the original season 1 ad hamada who only showed up in the first episode and then vanished abe was on record calling him a waste of skin and because the show never mentioned him again and treated tojima as the original ad fans refer to hamada as the phantom ad    unless a worse behind the scenes ad showed up tsuruoka was probably the second most hated ad from the staff but wasnt blacklisted due to him appearing to have a good relationship with arino both one of the actual directors i forget his name and tojima both mentioned tsuruokas pertinacity for sleeping and claimed he napped during the quest for ki live challenge i never saw it but what really pissed staff off was how he fucked up both in bikkuriman world where he failed to continue and forced a second day of shooting or how he gave arino incorrect information that would have killed the quest for ki live challenge because he had him pick up an item that would have had him teleport back multiple levels before arino managed to save the challenge with quick thinking    the fact they didnt say he graduated from the show and the indignant end to the xevious observation diary makes me think there was bad blood and it was only because arino liked him that he was allowed to come back at all
i wanna see arino play through shenmue
  hamada  you mean yamada
    damn i never knew all this thanks for all this info ill add it on the image i feel bad knowing thats how tsuruokas personality is he always was one of my favorite ads i love his dynamics with arino i was wondering whether or not to include the bikkuriman world accidental reset in the image but now that i think about it i dont think any other ads resetted arinos game accidentally let alone when he was at the final stage   do you have info related to other ads id love to put more stuff into the image
i love how literally no one noticed that the second part of tsubasa guesslation has been out for days
  the one abe hated was the original season 1 ad hamada who only showed up in the first episode and then vanished abe was on record calling him a waste of skin and because the show never mentioned him again and treated tojima as the original ad fans refer to hamada as the phantom ad    sounds like abe is just the most vocal and that everyone on staff hated the guy wonder what he did
  dont let any of that sour your liking of tsuroka i think its more the staff had great expectations since he was college educated and artistic the dioramas he created for quest of ki to help arino to the point they used classical music as his theme then he had all those errors and it must have just rubbed some of the staff the wrong way by no means he was a bad ad in terms of entertainment value he had great synergy with arino like when he intentionally sang the song from 53 stations of the tōkaidō several octaves high to get a laugh out arnio and it stuck so much that it became tsurokas personal song where he sang it for arino during the lemming special and later at budokan  or even though he screwed up with bikkuriman world it was arino who was there to try and cheer him up and it ended up raising the stakes of the game to its peak so seeing him win and how tsuroka was just ecstatic really made it a top episode     the one ad that will always catch my interest as to why she left was the first takahashi mainly because she did it mid season and it was clear it wasnt intended because they just used whoever they could to be arinos helper from graduated ads to toni and its clear that arino would like her back to do a guest spot and during her last tamage the announcer said she hope she comes back one day to get revenge on arino since arino beat her in a game  we do know she went on to get her teaching licence but the timing strikes me as odd
  no one cares its not worth watching
  i heard yamada was really lazy and got into arguments with arino and kan      they tend to use tanii when theyre doing something or going somewhere sketchy or unsettling its a lighthearted running joke that he skeeves people out
  super c is next
  thats all there is everything else is deleted and revomed forever all the hard work of arino and his team lost forever only dvd collection and some autist living in japan got a few more but still not all this is why pirating is important
  he means the quality of the work is not worth watching judging by the first episode he put out he admitted hes only an n5 and now hes actually asking for donations
  everything else is deleted and revomed forever  so_writes_a_liarjpg
  ok than try to find some of the deleted translated episode
  bullseye
  not many ddl but the torrents arent going away  
what was your favorite live event
  torrents  yeah good luck with that go ahead and try your luck see you next month
  oh yeah so many seeders i hope i can watch it next year should only take two or three month
  i think  you thought wrong sorry dude its dead
  anon there is a lot missing and deleted this is a fact just calling someone a lier doesnt help here the archives have many episodes most of them are in poor quality zoomed in not translated or simply do not work the episodes on gamingcxcom are mostly deleted and the full sets on torrents have almost no seeders or often just the raw rawonly jp no sub you can go on and pretend as if everything is ok and nothing is to be worried about but the fact will remain hard work of arino and his team is slowly vanishing
what is with this esl guy suddenly posting
  white wale this shits been online for years
  it seems he had found it but was having trouble ripping it so some anons helped him out
  he was struggling to stream it since it kept error and stuttering
  nakayama  this goes hand in hand with the bowing line but you gotta add ponkoron or ポンコロン
  they let him on stage at budokan i dont think theres bad blood
  there was a video of her in wagyan land 2
didnt inoue get wasted publicly or was that just a rumor
  he was once late for an episode he was in charge of because he got blackout drunk and woke up at noon in a parking lot
  what ive noticed about some of the episodes on archive is that the subtitles are cut off so be careful before you download
  i guess youre right whats important is that he had great synergy with arino and thats what ultimately matters plus it was really touching when you saw his reaction after arino beat bikkuriman world   the first takahashi really didnt do much but she never was entertaining enough for me i only recall her dinosaur drawing so i didnt care much
  they used tani as the helper for clock tower where he showed up to give support to arino to get the good end they also used kibe as the helper for sword of musashi and didnt make a mention of takahashi they officially announced she left for the super ghosts n ghouls episode       takahashi wasnt around enough to have a full report with arino outside of his teasing could be construed as sexual harrassment takashashi was still noteworthy because a she remains the only female ad who played a game to support arino b shes the only support ad with a perfect win record for the episodes she was there
    thank you very much man
  its in the viewing guide in the op
  to have a full report with arino  do you mean rapport
  lolz peeps be stoopid
    super bomberman next week
    there is also 1992 sfc    looking forward to    thats final fantasy v are they gonna have a new side segment devoted to it or is that gonna be a challenge i think thats like a 14 hour game or something for a first play through
  nice guess i know what im playing next then
  it seems the new segment has arino playing a famicom appraiser
how much does arino make hes got more than gccx going and is a comedian with decades of shows on tv a minor celebrity     i guess hes at least a small time millionaire     right
    so whats up with the 1992 sfc bit then oh are they gonna just do segments going through the games released in 1992
  theyre going to talk about it for 20 seconds have you even watched this show how do you not know they go through the entire console library in chronological order and talk a bit about 3 games per episode
  thats just the game collection piece they do in almost every episode like  said
im the one whos been crying for months for the captain tsubasa episodes translation    the first episode translated was really bad it was painfully obvious the translator didnt even skim through the manga or check a comment on the game so as to understand what was going on mistranslating names missing on puns the misugi one is critical    overall really disappointed wont ever bother to watch the second one
  why put in effort when retards will donate money to you anyway
  does this nigga ever get angry  there was this time when he kinda scolded arino in the middle of a shoot in the derby stallion ep when hes a producer then arino fucks up twice in a row that costed him two derbies to be skipped for no reason
  yeah well good for him i guess theres many more effective things you can do to make money instead of that though
i have an old karnov episode stored on an external hard drive ill upload it soon
  watch them get confused and never get around to subbing the first tsubasa challenge
the boyz
  why didnt u play it 20 years ago you need some stupid show to tell u what to play
  i was happy about the first release and look forward to the second i dont give a shit about the misugi pun
  because i was never into super bomberman outside of the multiplayer in i think 4 or 5 and the n64 singleplayer titles and i enjoy playing the games and then watching arino play them
  it was a disgusting train wreck i will say without a doubt that tv nihon would have done a better job yes it was that bad
    who cares honestly just resub it if it wasnt up to snuff didnt seem like sagccx were all that interested in doing it either way
  i dont know japanese but i know enough about the game and the animu to realize the huge amount of mistakes it had
  so how about instead of whining as if its the end of the world writing up and timestamping all of the mistakes it had and then someone can fix it up
  then learn japanese its what im doing since translations slowed down
  theyre never going to do it and they were never going to do it theyre not confused they just dont care about captain tsubasa
  ok you convinced me ill watch the episode again and write down the corrections timestamped    dont know why everyone hardsubs this though
  i cant wait for his next release people like you can go fuck themselves d
  i could play hundreds of games in the time itd take me to learn japanese    even moreso the only actual reason i had to learn jap would be to read the logh novels and gundam ones theyre all translated or getting translated at the moment and the amount of japanese you need to learn to start reading literature is insane id love to read kawabata mishima soseki but id have be born again as a japanese to do that so its absolutely pointless
  thats one thing i never got  softsubs not only allow you to fix timing issues it also allows others to fix translation mistakes and allows for easy communal translations   all hardsubs have going for them is that they run on machines that dont know what to do with srt/ass files
  good for you i guess i was really expecting these episodes to be translated am a huge fan of this show the manga and the game series ct2 is my favorite out of all the tsubasa games too so i was a bit disappointed
  allows for easy communal translations  translating is challenging if someone thinks its easy they might not be doing as good a job as they think    as someone else stated in another thread communal translations may start with good intentions but almost always produce bad results
  cant be worse than this
   not only allow you to fix timing issues  this should never be an issue on a release from someone with half a brain  it also allows others to fix translation mistakes and allows for easy communal translations  and this is just pure insanity how many communal translations have you seen buddy      an unsubbed show can eventually be subbed a poorly subbed show will never be subbed again 99 of the time theres nothing worse than bad translations
  how many communal translations have you seen buddy  early kakaricho sub was posted here to be looked over from what i recall obviously with him having final say of what went in    not that we see much subs of anything nowadays outside of sagccx and gnt yearlies all the sub groups for everything seem to have died off for some reason
  tvn arent even bad anymore outside of their hideous colors and effects they actually have more accurate and far less cringeworthy subs than the other groups who do the same stuff its not 2008 anymore
    to be fair if we manage to do a communal translation of these captain tsubasa episodes theyll at least be better than the shit thats already out and it did seem like sa have no plans of eventually doing them
  harder to steal subs
  steal subs
  back in the early days of anime fansubbing groups just taking other groups subs changing the lines somewhat and then releasing it as their own work on their own website with their own paypal buttons and shit was somewhat of a thing it was before the days of centralized torrent sites so lots of people wouldnt be aware that other groups worked on the same show
  and yet anime fansubs never went to hardsubs
  they absolutely did
  what series or groups when i never saw much of it  sure people tended to hardsub their logo into the title card in the opand sometimes the karaoke as well but i think that was more due to a lack of support early on for animated subs but thats the extent of what i saw commonly back in the day
now that i think about it this dude is profitting from his shitty translations and shamefully samefagging this thread i dont think theres a good reason to make a writeup of his mistakes and help him
  i think your back in the day is more recent than others back in the day hardsubbing fell out of fashion quite a while ago
tfw these threads devolve into arguing about subs and proficiency in japanese 90 of the time
  not that anon but back around 2004ish i remember downloading hardcoded subtitled avis from direct connect hubs not everyone was doing mkvs ogms or using separate srt or sub files
  maybe so my back in the day refers to the midto late2000s before that i didnt have anything more than dialup and the plan my family had allowed something like one hour of internet access per week without accruing fees it was just the bare minimum plan that was offered by our phone company
  if you spent months of your life learning moon language to be able to read porn doujins and watch a guy play childrens video games wouldnt you talk about it too
      i only really started seeing soft subs outnumber hard subs when horriblesubs/crunchyroll became a thing or for anime ripped from localized dvds obviously since those already have soft subs anime subs usually had hard subs especially so they could do annoying stuff with the colors and fonts ive seen a couple fansubs where the color of the subs would always match the hair color of the person speaking for example for some reason you can do that stuff with soft subs too nowadays but i dont think anybody does
  id rather just talk about funny parts in the show and anons favorite ads
whats your dream episode you want subbed    i want to see season 17 finished off woody poko aighinas prophecy etc
  episode 106 the yuji horii interview special
  i really want the entirety of season 1 properly subbed if you want me to single out an episode the namco one
    biohazard
ywn eat pizza with arino and crew
  you will never eat abes homecooked pizzas
  yes this
  yea i used to sub anime back in around 20022004 and we all did hard coded subs on avi files and released them on irc mkv container didnt even exist yet
  ywn be an ad and get to bullshit around while playing games with arino
  heh
  i want more horror episodes if theres anything left unsubbed    also love adventure/dating games
  i dont think d is subbed is it
  you make it sound like thats easy
  the only horror ones ive seen were clock tower sos the one about the cabin in the snow and the one that was some 3d haunted mansion thing i havent watched all the episodes but i did watch every adventure/horror one so probably its not subbed
  that s because subs for the show are dead so theres nothing left to discuss unless we want to watch raws and try to interpret whats going on and also shit on the idiot who supplies the raws but has them be bloated in sizee and then laugh as he gets butthurt when someone compresses them
    yeah d isnt subbed its episode 190 from season 18 which has roughly half its eps subbed
1857 his yattaze manga is regarding tsubasa always scoring the important goals with the overhead so hes saying that he achieved it thanks to knowing the manga more than he did it like in the manga which has not much to do with the original phrase its more like we did it manga  2747 absolute rubbish what it says is that nankatsu and touhou will go for the the bichampionship v2 this is because both teams tied and shared the pennant last year  3006 as cool as hayabusa shoot sounds its literally falcon shoot  3048 ending phrases with tai is the characters slang so i guess he could leave it like that like a weeb but most translators prefer to change it to yknow  3204 skydive should be skylab  3309 translated bunshin as shadow clones is this a naruto thing when hes just talking about the balls copies during the shot animation couldve translated uwah the ball is multiplying or uwah ball copies for the same effect the written line makes no sense in context  3747 misugi is also one of the main characters adding another tl note would look hideous though  3921 he fucking sucks  really  4119 fucking for the third time  the ending sequence is so poorly worded that it took me a couple times to understand what he tried to say maybe if he knew in advance that sao paulo would be playing against the best players of the high school tournament then he wouldve understood what the coach was talking about    part 2 is better besides the cluttered text  224 misugi is one of the main characters of the manga too  614 again skydive is actually skylab  3000 gyro is jairo  3317 pelnandes is hernandez  5534 we freaking won    names are already romanized in the game guide  babinton  babington  jew  gil  dotour  doutor  renaato  renato  tahamat/tamahata  tahamata though its true arino misread his name  platon  platton  deuce santos  dirceu  amarau  amaral  zagaro santos  zagallo  itta   nitta  robert  roberto
  i have to agree with 
  im kinda for organizing a project to resub these episodes though
  well too late i guess maybe some anons watched both episodes and this helps them    zombie kabuto can go fuck himself for monetizing this mediocre work though i wonder if he even told the people in the japanese learning thread that he inteded to make money off of they work
  pay me and ill do a less shitty job isnt a great approach imo
  is he getting help there
  yes he thanked them for their help in the subbed second part
  so its literally some dude with piss poor understanding of japanese subbing what he thinks he can understand asking a bunch of other faggots for help on the stuff he cant then asking for money  and still delivering a shit tier product    yeah this needs resubbing
  i think the worst part is that he subbed an episode of a game/manga he knew nothing about while these are available in english and you have lots of other resources wikis faqs fandoms to assist you even then his job was subpar
  add in that sa said they didnt really want to sub the tsubasa episodes because they werent familiar with the franchise or soccer in general
it really saddens me because this game is my favorite fc/nes one and one of my all time favorites    amazing ost pretty innovative sportsrpg style badass tecmo theater one of the best ost in the console and despite having a kinda predictable story the reveal scenes were fucking neat        the series is very much alive right now with a new animu thats pretty decent and a gacha that has thousands and thousands of players if only whales were to give a small percentile of their money to a fantranslation group we could easily get ct3 4 and 5 
  oh and did i say the ost is absolutely top tier
spite is a great motivator to get this tsubasa resubbing project off the ground  just make sure to find ways to shit on the original translators
whose idea was the gccx movie anyway    did the staff suffer a morale loss after it flopped
  the original castlevania one    i know its a dvd special but how in the name of fuck would you not have it translated
  the fact arino said everyone should forget about it makes me say signs point to yes
have they done mega man 5 yet or is it a never ever game because arino is both terrible at mega man and its impossible to pace post mega man 3 games properly
  theyve only done up to 4 in the classic series and x1 and x2 in the x series the op has an episode list
  no but theyve done mm4 as well as x1 and x2    5 is kinda dull but theyll probably do it eventually
    the real killer for later mega man games is the pacing since they did the 8 robot masters and cossacks stages in one episode leaving them only with the wily stages for the 2nd one unless they had zero good content for 2/3rds of the game its just bad pacing im just worried that if do 5 theyd do the same thing with the darkman stages
  yes  i also grind for lives in action games where possible
      russians have already seen it almost 4 years ago
do you think they could continue with mega man they havent done 5 6 or x3 onwards mm games are pretty damn repetitive so i think they should skip 58 x3 and then x4 should be the next ones
        check out nosferatu its subbed     the one about the cabin in the snow and the one that was some 3d haunted mansion thing    mansion of lost souls
  i would say nosferatu is as much of a horror game as castlevania
been watching this again recently the something awful subtitles are really bad i only have basic knowledge of japanese but im noticing heaps of errors did any other groups sub this show
  what kind of errors are you talking about examples
  did any other groups sub this show  nope gccxs popularity in the west fell off a cliff after the dvd and game bombed
  fuck yes
  i only have basic japanese but i can find fault with the translator who subbed the official dvd release no i will not post proof    like clockwork in these threads
i would like to translate this program into other languages and spread kachous love what program do you guys recommend to create subs
  aegisub      ninas translations are really good i dont agree with all her localization choices but no one has her beat when it comes to adapting arinos comedy into english or productivity/endurance/passion for that matter
  thanks amigo
      use softsubs retard
  aight just saves me the trouble of having to use ffmpeg
  any chance youd share the sub files for the tsubasa eps
  sorry to say i didnt keep them
well if anything this makes me even more interested in resubbing this retards garbage
  all bark but no bite
  use git ya git
  as in github for just some subs
  it will only end up giving him more attention and hell try to find a way to profit off of it more probably by acting like a victim just expose him for what he is instead
  but it will give people subs for the episode
  it would be better to do them from scratch starting with the first game from season 16
  nina can suck a dick
  i like this guy please keep subbing more episodes sa is dead and good riddance
  nice to know someones enjoying himself  though i do gotta correct you sa aint dead yet they subbed the adventure of link 2 parter on september and october to find their subs on nyaa you have to write game center cx instead of gamecenter cx
    im so sorry kike anon i just couldnt help myself
anyone else really torn about kaga  he has a great attitude hes helpful and has a lot of nice running jokesbut hes repulsive  every time they allow him on screen with his hair slicked back and showing that messy receding hairline together with his mainland chineselooking physionomy hes just hard to stomach    i dont even know why it bothers me this much hes not the first ugly ad  but its like he hits some unknown golden ratio of ugliness that makes him unbearable to my eyes
  seeing your work its not surprising sorry mate
  profit machine broke understandable have a nice day
  so is the second part done i dont see a link for it o_o
  a link for both parts would be nice
  this post stays up  the post mentioning kan gets deleted  cover up
  if you want to continue subbing then why wont you do the dvd challenges druaga resident evil sonic 2 castlevania die hard arcade etc sa is afraid to sub them because they dont want to cut the dvd sales
  2018  tv rip  gif    bro time to get right with jesus and download the bd rips and make a webm
  if you want to continue subbing then why wont you do the dvd challenges druaga resident evil sonic 2 castlevania die hard arcade etc sa is afraid to sub them because they dont want to cut the dvd sales    that would actually be useful
  are there koolguy bluray
news from the op    270 will be a game from the castlevania series they apparently screwed up and dropped the hint at the end of 269 so they tweeted it instead    yoiko is at nintendo live 2018 in kyoto this saturday it looks like theyll be playing the same games as in toyko but theyll also play with kids and parents in smash ultimate and splatoon 2
  everything you said about him is why hes so funny to me i love him he embodies awkward humor in the same way that nakayama did except to a much higher degree
i remember seeing a live stream of him challenging a mega man in front of an audience a few years ago and i think he did another game tooanyone got an episode name/link for that
  in season 17 he did two live broadcast challenges there was no audience other than the staff in studio    he did mega man 2 for the famicom 30th anniversary and super mario bros for the fuji tv one/two/next 15th anniversary the ops episode list has them as le6 and le7    he also did the budokan show that year but that wasnt a live broadcast and was obviously in front of a large audience
    it also says nintendo put the digest version of the mega man 2 challenge on their youtube channel a couple years ago when the famicom mini was coming out    
    thanks thats it even though i misremembered the audience love this and the mario challenge so much
    sure imma put them on the backlog then which is empty apart from the current episode im subbing
    
  my b i didnt bother to update my already existing gif when i got my hands on the bds    midnight crew subs are subbing them
  you need to stop talking to yourself
so what time in america is arnio going to be doing his part for nintendo show in japan
  arino and hamaguchi should first show up about 7 hours from now op has a clock with the links
  the op has an update hamaguchi is gonna be a few hours late hell be there by the time they play smash
b15 dec 21 2018 biohazard 2 resident evil 2     another biohazard game ill never see subbed    _
watching the tenchi wo kurae episode    maybe im the only one with this opinion but i wish theyd stop doing beat em up episodes  theyre boring every single level is the same and theres not going to be anything new from start to finish aside arino is having difficulties with this room with slightly more enemies than usual  aside that the only gameplay is mashing attack whether youre a good player or not  and when he dies it just means watching boring footage of him mashing attack again for additional minutes    theres just nothing to enjoy about them for me the challenge ends up being a repetitive slog in which the only thing that changes is this time he mashed well or uh oh should have mashed harder    feel free to contradict me if you enjoy them i guess but theyre just the worst absolute genre for the program
  tenchi o kurau in particular is kind of a muddy ugly game
  nodas head will fly for this
  i will never understand the fascination for those shitty chineseinspired works  theres a billion of them and theyre all exactly the same  team of too many manly man protagonists to care too much about each individual one  each ones shtick is i have a huge blessed weapon from my honorable family  entire plot is some shitty political drama in which the moral of the story is big weapon conquer big country
  do you hate being powerful
  tenchi wo kurau is a manga the game is based on that its not an original video game properity
  in his defense he had wanted them to do the tenchi o kurau sequel instead of the one they played the sequel is definitely nicer looking      im sure he means anything based on the three kingdoms period including that manga
  i missed the start but it says he made it back in time for arms i guess theyre doing the kid/parent thing for all the games today
biohazard eps are literally all i want to see translated
  thanks man your work really is appreciated too bad the majority of people that actually talk in this thread are just pieces of shit but a lot of us who dont even bother talking here do appreciate your efforts nobody else is going to do it and i think you are well within your rights to have a donation button despite what these morons say and i agree with this dude about the dvd bonus eps i really feel like if theres a requested order of what eps should be done it would be the dvd bonus episodes the damned yuji horii interview episode plz god and then whatever early eps that were never done from season 1 or whatever anyway thats just my 2 cents thanks again bud
  theres really nothing more pathetic than eops like yourself who fellate even braindead esls online in the hopes of getting your next sub fix    do you seriously not have even an ounce of selfrespect
  dis dood a faggot
  nobody that actually have things they want translated want this fuck to do it though
anyone else really like abes appearances on the program  of course i dont mean in a gay way or anything  though maybe itd be nice to ride on his bike while holding onto his strong body ahah
  i would have sex with him ironically
  i meant anything based on that three kingdoms garbage not just that in particular
    2018 famitsu news piece on gccx
why did she look like she was about to cry at the start of each segment  both her voice and her face make it look like shes close to tears or like kanp is pointing a gun at her from behind the camera
  i think ootani was just very shy and not used to public speaking or reading off of cue cards probably not too different from a lot of the staff
  yeah thatd be a pretty funny scenario ahah
  fujobaitjpg
so whats with the censored faces in the tamage on the latest episode  i know japanese are super sensitive about this but i dont remember gccx in particular giving a shit about it before do i just have bad memory is this decided by the production company itself or the place where they shoot the video
  didnt watch the episode yet but japan has extremely strict laws against distribution of photographs or video of people against their will its not so much a sensitivity issue as it is an we can get taken to court for this issue some stations just blur everyones faces to be on the safe side is that what happened here
  yeah the thing is i dont remember this happening before in the show either i dont remember or the segments just happened to not have a clear shot of other people before which i doubt
  did they blur everyone or just a couple people
  i saw it again and you see it mostly on people playing right next to him and a guy that walked fairly close to the camera  there are a couple of uncensored faces but they seem to be staff both from the show and the place or people whose faces werent close enough so they looked kinda blurry to begin with
  people like that guy are too close to the camera for legal comfort so chances are they either just blurred him to be on the safe side or failed to get him to agree to being on tv either because they werent able to ask before he left or because he said no
    arinos starting to look pretty old     _
  at least hes aging pretty gracefully rright
    nah ehs only in his 40s and hes starting to get that old man look skin is sagging getting wrinkles guess its long hours of work
  wonder if he wouldve guessed that hell be playing videogames for a living than for leisure on top of his double act with hamguchi
  does he even get any notoriety as a part of yoiko at this point  any time someone recognizes him its as za kacho not that guy doing mildly amusing standup
   he even get any notoriety as a part of yoiko at this point  this shit is always comedy gold to me fucking eops think a tiny show on a satellite channel somehow erases decades of other work because theyve never seen any of it    people recognise him as the kacho because hes wearing the fucking jumpsuit and going to places where his appearance was prearranged so fans of the show can show up
  im not talking about segments on gccx though  and gccxs ratings as a whole are higher than anything yoiko related that hes done in the past years    also stop shitting up the thread with the eop meme its supposed to indicate people who cant speak japanese in this thread not people i disagree with
  even when he goes on mechaike hes going more and more as kacho and less as a part of yoiko  same goes for his other tv appearances  almost every one of his radio appearances is simply done as arino shinya and even then the conversation usually goes towards games instead of his comedy career    your fucking eops spiel despite being completely wrong makes me just figure youre some larper or even worse some selfassessed n2
  wait wtf    they subbed the fucking movie for russians but not in english    fuck this gay earth
    i legit thought that 4channers were joking when they said that there was a movie then i heard reviews of it and it just sounds like some bizzare experiment
            
    whenever hes in a mainstream show no one knows or talks about his kacho personality though very rarely someone like matsumoto whos a gamer himself mentions that arinos into games but thats about it video games are still very much ignored in japanese mainstream tv
arino should challenge magical popn
  what he should really challenge is a puzzle game again  one with actual challenge thats not babby shit like bazaru de gozaru  most of the fun of puzzle episodes is seeing him struggle to find the solution and they keep giving him absurdly easy games in which he doesnt get stuck even once
  i love how much bazar dé gozarre swag there is
  mechaike is actually finished as of about 8 months ago
dead show  dead thread
has there been a subtitled trip episode since the shikoku one
  no the cruise from the season after hasnt been subbed yet
only if i keep dying on the boss fight lol
  because they had him preform the 53 stations of the tōkaidō song having another ad do it would have caused a riot it would be like having someone other than nakayama sing last continue
      this in one of the early episodes arino asked if he could take a turn on someones game and he just told arino to piss off and they censored his face    meanwhile you had other times like that one guy who was a master of some shump game where he let arino take over and arino promptly lost all the extra lives he earned the guy was alright with it and arino left him one of his coveted business cards as an apology and thank you
    watched both of these the rip from the jap website is 512x384 letter boxed the batch torrent is 704x396  the only difference is one of the last continue montages is put in different sections and the rip includes the end of a few commercials both are still missing i dont know how long the original special went but there still is a 30 minute gap so that could have been cut commercials     also watching the whole thing twice it was a bit absurd how arino and the staff just threw anything out the window to have arino clear the game because even with ad support arino only completed half the game with 7 hours and 30 minutes left so they either had emoto or nakayama play the levels or just straight up told arino how to beat them in order to clear the game in time
  arinos a fuckin asshole
    castlevania bloodlines next week
  my money is on either 2 parter or he fails it unless they let him use stage select
      japanese version has infinite continues it should be beatable
what is/are your favorite episodes anon
  did he beat you at skeeball or steal all your snickers bars
  most of his adventure game challenges are comfy af but the specials were the best imo i dont think i ever enjoyed an episode more than the one featured in shikoku
  anons favorite ad  yes lets do this for me its nakayama aka the bowing man
op says yoikos first smash bros episode comes out on december 3 they also have the rest of the gccx new years marathon contents up on the episode list
last night i saw the alex kidd episode where the ad brings arino some home made rice balls to eat im amazed the sa subtitles didnt say here arino i brought you some burgers to eat
does anybody have the ode to joy remix that appears in the captain tsubasa ii episode
  you mean over the opening theyve been using that remix for the last two seasons
  well sa is really behind the times
  any castlevania or mario playthrough
  mad stacks
arino should tackle mother 2
  rpgs arent overly suitable for this kind of show
  he already has actually
  he only did a tiny bit of it for an online episode back in 2013 it probably wouldnt make for great tv if they were to do the whole thing
  /vr/ literally subbed episodes  specials but still   you can imagine how that went with how little its brought up here anymore and by following the course of this thread
  and the translator joined sa
young arino
  unironically battletoads
i was so disappointed when he couldnt play doom because of the cartridge that didnt work properly
  personally i like the episodes where he travels for example the cambodia one exudes danger i felt like those people wanted to kill him at any given moment joking aside it was so damn cozy watching their way of life the houses on water or the fishing restaurant part when he and his troup caught those tiny fishes and ate them it was also very funny watching him discovering one of those 9999999 in 1 cartridge or that time the saleswoman was so incapable that when testing the crash bandicoot game for him she nonchalantly destroyed it the moment i saw that i wasnt thinking stuff like perhaps theyre not used to this kind of stuff yet but rather bitch what the fuck have you done
  what crash bandicoot deserves
  i still freak out thinking about arino on that ferris wheel and almost getting his arm cut off if hed pulled it back a second later
  ps2 crash team racing ripoff  i agree luckily it wasnt any of the ps1 stuff
  the sad part is that there was nothing wrong with the cartridge it wouldve worked if they had hooked up the snes to a regular television but they used a monitor that wasnt totally compatible with the special chips in some games nobody there knew that
  ohh thats true i think youre right  still grownup mario and his daughter didnt seem so reliable to begin with i wouldnt expect them to know that kind of things thats a shame
  theres a lot of episodes i loved so ill single out some  mighty bomb jack  yuuyus quiz de go go   fzero part 2   mystery of atlantis  super ghouls n ghosts  go by train  quiz the feudal lords ambition
  sonic the hedgehog adventure island and battletoads
is there a torrent for the yoiko minecraft series mega is annoying with its download cap
is there a place to find season 1 full episodes and not these 5 min bullshits
      four episodes and the special at the end are the only season 1 things with complete subs so far the rest are partials with just the challenges subbed
  d the special at the end are the only  is there place to get entire raw of the episode
  use youtubedl or something to download the playlist straight from youtube get the subs from googledrive stick them in the same folder and you should be good to go
  what ep
    magnetxturnbtih593a407e783a58e3b462d83599258aebb215a4b8    this torrent has them at least has some other rare stuff too like the full 24 hour lemmings special
  get the subs from googledrive  translator put them in his mega folders when he finished the second season you can get them all with one tiny download for each season
  it says they postponed it until december 4th itll be like 24 hours from now
  raws of the licensed episodes  if i wasnt lazy/incompetent as fuck id take the subs we already had for the episodes and segments and put them on those episodes so we finally had a complete version
  yoiko minecraft  ive found some guy on the internet that is translating it 
  that is the minecraft anon
  why do you think so it wasnt that apparent to me not saying youre wrong though
  his playlists are in the latest subs paste in the op with his mega links its the same guy
  i dont think that what you said just now automatically means that the anon who asked for them its the same translating these
  youre misunderstanding the anon trying to download them is not the translator    minecraft anon means the guy who translated them he finished subbing minecraft almost two months ago and sent the mega links and playlists to the pastebin these threads have known about him for well over a year
new thread    
whats this show about
  now i get it im sorry thanks for the very much appreciated elucidation
  no problem it was just a little confusion
  old asian man playing old asian games
what do you guys think about customizing retro hardware    seems like the cool thing to do nowadays is hideous custom versions
  i wanted to throw a gba sp into an original gameboy case i had like 4 original gameboys at one point
    why though wouldnt the gba cart not fit
  gba guts in an original gb form factor theres something nice about that big brick gb body
  top left and the bottom two are fine
    i actually like this one    i am not the only one right        agreed with this painted ones here are messy
  im ok with adding backlights and bivert mods to nonbacklit gameboy screens also installing high quality lcds on the game gear or lynx anything else just looks tacky i personally wouldnt modify the external shells
    what about stuff like this
  i customize a lot but mostly for functionality gay ricer shit disgusts me
i own this  
reeeeeeeeeeee gba is not retro
    close enough really        that seems unwieldy and useless
  bottom right then bottom left for me
if only i was rich
  close enough really  nope read the rules
    thread has been here over a day it is obviously heavily enforced
  wtf man
if the modification is functional like back lit screens on handhelds additional video outputs on home consoles and region mods im 100 on board solely cosmetic shit i dont care about if the base system was perfectly fine to begin with but if it was all beat up and busted and someone put it in a custom case im fine with that     portable versions of consoles are cool for all of 2 minutes when you realize that theres zero practicality in a 45 pound handheld especially disc based systems were you basically have to hold it completely level and still or risk fucking the disc
i did a gay mod to my gba new shell backlit rechargeable battery whatever
  gore thread
modded gbas look so damn good
  youre not the only one    anyways i have no qualms about aesthetically modifying a console or handheld that you use often personally i want to do something with my playstation but i have no experience in taking consoles apart or finding new shells for them
    ill agree with you on this the middle right one looks like its trying too hard to be radical 90s kid cool  and the less we talk about the character ones the better
  okay thats actually pretty funny
  component video out of a snes
  thats how i connect most of mine not everyone wants to have a tiny pvmeme in every room
  not  even  enough  rupees
        does stuff like that make any difference on image quality    is it the best way to make old consoles look good on an hd tv
  vs composhit a yuge difference it also has the advantage of being easy to use cables and switches for rgb are bulky and expensive and a component crt is a good free/cheap option for people who dont live in scartland    making something look good on an hd tv depends on what console it is and what tv it is making it function good is a whole other thing
  gay in a good way id suck your gbas dick looks awesome
  the problem with the sp is that you cant really have a logo thats meant to be oriented a certain way sure that design looks nice when its folded up but when youre playing its upside down  of course the people that do these things dont play on them so why would they care
i want a crystal themed gbc
  when youre playing it and cant see the logo its oriented in a way that might be a little hard to read if you could see it  the people that do these things dont play on them so why would they care  i only care about what other people see when they see me playing  epic fucking irony
  oh hey its jaqueline shes real nice i have a gba from her
i wouldnt mind getting my nes painted
    i really like that crystal shell i may consider one if it goes up    been looking for a frontlit5v pocket but havent seen anything i like will probably reshell it with that pokémon center one from bluishsquirrel
    i have a couple custom carts for romhacks    kinda want a custom handheld
  would have looked cooler without the gay horns maybe a good old fashioned pentagram on the back
find a flaw
too easy
  2018  still no robotron
  even with a life every 25k its pretty difficult
  pretty easy game     also the game came out on a lot of hardware that could have improved everything about it yet it was the same game on all hardware near launch similar if a 3ds game launched today and we used that version for ps4 x1 pc switch
how do we feel about this here
    ok what the fuck is this meme  please explain how robotron is easy
  its a little dull sadly the original is way more fun and intense despite the primitive hardware      there are none only bad posters will assert that this game has flaws
i kinda feel like building a mame bartop arcade machine just to play robotron and maybe some trackball games  i feel like 8 way joysticks would be much easier than analog sticks or dpad  face buttons
  way too easy
  smash tv is better
williams was the fucking king of the arcades better than namco imo robotron joust bubbles and blaster are all classics was never able to get into defender though honestly
  oh and splat is also very fun and unique i never hear anyone talk about that game ive only ever played it on the midway compilation for ps2 though
    ok now thats fucking edgy
  now this is a great post    undeniable really
jeff minter shit is great i miss reading his old articles ranting about trinitrons and psychedelic colors in atari st gaming mags
    i enjoy it
    smash tv is not better although it is pretty nice
  williams was the fucking king of the arcades  i respectfully disagree it holds a solid 2nd place tho
found one  the cheap volume petentiometers used in williams arcade cabinets need replaced these days or else the sound shits out
not as good as quake but still better than most fps games out there why dont they make games like this anymore    
bald space marines running and gunning around a single space base tileset 1997 edition
not as good as quake  not this meme again
in my opinion both quake i and ii are equally not as good as doom    still good games though
  fpbp  quake ii is an awesome game but its way too easy covered with oversatured concepts and finally a laughable gunplay which doesnt help either back in the day just as it is today i still have a real blast when playing the previous chapter instead probably because its something way more original in concepts and overall damn satisfying to play ditching those lovecraftian terrors those gothic landscapes and those phenomenal weapons was the worst thing they couldve done    but nostalgicfaggotry aside if we want to talk about other fps that came out on the same year then even there frankly q2 can only pale in comparison turok shadow warrior the quake mission packs hexen ii and fucking blood to name a few however if we want to compare q2 to newgen games instead with the likes of what we have to this very day then only in this case i can agree with you op
  gotta agree on blood its hard to believe they came out same year quake was technically superior and offered more of what people wanted in terms of multiplayer 3d  physics  multi  these power words got people very excited back then
  exactly though if i can rectify myself i would say that i wasnt perfectly clear on my points especially if we look at the facts which you can easily deduce from my previous post such as for example turokq2 thats absolutely not the case because its something that can be very subjective but one thing maybe can be agreeable that is that at least regarding concepts difficulty and weapons turok is way up there though in level design q2 is way better too bad that the latter is encapsulated with stuff like space stations and so on which ultimately caused quake to be what it is today at least solely in terms of single player in fact nothing to say about multi this game was spot on i still remember happily playing it in local with my friends on playstation
  soundtrack and sound effects are superior   nothing like the sound of a super shotgun blasting strogg away with a metal soundtrack
i never understood the hateboner for quake ii  to me the first game was an unfinished mess that didnt know what it wanted to be quake ii at least had an actual direction and it was overall as enjoyable as the first game
  these games were really about lan deathmatch     quake was a tech demo
  on playstation kek that sounds sweet never tried that i agree its a matter of taste q2 was miles ahead on multi that was the selling point sort of like unreal later or halo later still although that did actually have a lot more going for it turok was high quality but different having said that skip ahead a few years to star trek voyager elite force which objectively is the greatest shooter of all time and anyone who doesnt share my autistic opinion is clearly a pleb borg drone i like local multi but big set pieces and npc team mates charge my phaser rifle
  based
  cringe
  quake 2 on playstation is unironically a very good experience  by the way i agree that if we want to look solely at the multiplayer aspect than we cant say much about it it was great on the other hand i cant share your elitism for your later words especially regarding a literally who videogame that who knows maybe its good as you say but absolutely not on par of other classics although i lost you since you mentioned unreal that imho actually had a very good campaign with ugly but sort of justified bullet sponges and more over halo which along other games like halflife permanently ruined the fps scene as we knew it or at least in my humble opinion
  you know i think i can seriously manage to masturbate with that video you posted
  hell quake is a very good game but id rather play quake ii anyday of the week than q1
  have you tried playing quake on a modern source port such as quakespasm with colored lighting the atmosphere is unmatched then you have stuff like arcane dimensions    you can download the colored lit files for quake and many of the mods here        quake 2 is also excellent ofcource 3 sucks dick
  quakespasm nowadays is truly a must while arcane dimensions appears everytime someone talks about quake and im so glad for it when i looked up thanks to other anons like you i thought that i did such an amazing discovery especially because thanks to ad ive experienced the same feels i had in 96 while playing quake for the very first time i still remember the very first secret of hanger 16 with that button on the ceiling just above the out of service one great doom easter egg
    it was a joke guise however as a trek fan i unironically enjoyed the hell out of elite force but clearly its not for everyone halo was the last time i enjoyed a local fps party tho
  thanks anon  ad is something truly special worthy of a physical release imo
i think its slightly better than quake but then ive only finished quake 2 once also strafe jumping is more refined in this title
  how the hell does your shotgun look different do you have a link please that looks cool
  
    talk about awkward childhood faps i played the quake trilogy excessively and q2 released right when i hit puberty
  i disagree so its a meme  no
  i preferred quake ii to quake  better music yes i prefer metal to ambient  better weapons super shotgun and bfg alone win this category  better lighting a result of the engine  i also preferred the more action oriented aesthetic to the horror one of the first
  i always feel like if quake 1 had more weapons and enemies it couldve surpassed doom for me
  its a shame quake ii never received as much attention of the modding community compared to quake it had so much potential     
the psx version is fucking killer i know its heavily stripped down compared to the pc original but theres just something about it that i love the tighter level design more vibrant environments and the added weight of the controller  rumble made the weapons so much more satisfying short sweet simple i love the kind of game that you can sit down with get really drunk and have a blast blowing through it in a few hours quake 2 on psx is one of those games
  why dont they make games like this anymore  they do
  this right here quake 2 is super fun and i played it for hundreds of hours on nintendo 64 and later on pc but there are almost no new maps for it quake has new maps being released every day and ad singlehandedly breathed new life into it
  no but youve made me wnt to try it thank you for fucking my weekend schedule
  fpbp fuck quake 2
  totally agree my major gripes with quake is that the enemies are basically bullet sponges compared to dooms enemies it made the gunplay far less fun and make the weapons feel like pea shooters
  fuck quake ii  no fuck you
those jetpack guys who take like a million years to kill    those guys are nox why do they have so much hp
  thought it was better personally
  thats the problem with game balance it basically means making everything shit i dont want fucking game balance i want game fun and sometimes that means fucking everything over with low error
  have you ever played devil daggers its not retro but its basically a perfect distillation of what makes doom fun a movementbased shooter where youll die super fast if you manage to get surrounded you die in one hit but youre basically a demigod shredding through huge swarms of enemies with fantastical weaponry
    thx mate
daily reminder emulating psx version is the best quake 2 experience you can ever get    
  how do i install those files i just need to extract archive content to id1 folder 
  yup these files should go to quakeid1maps
   thank you for fucking my weekend schedule    youre welcome also try the soul of evil mission pack it contains an arena style survival mode along with a really fun and unique campaign one of the best mission packs     much better with colored lighting     
  not knowing both of them are abortions  fyi  q1  was supposed to be some dark medieval sword play was changed all the time then they decided to make it like doom with guns    q2  was supposed to be a totally different gamenot the quake name with a different name then they slapped on the quake name on it for no fucken reason whatsoever
   knowing both of them are abortions  fyi  on january 30 2018 john romero and tom hall confirmed on twitter that doomguy is the son of commander keen protagonist billy blaze and the greatgrandson of wolfenstein protagonist william bj blazkowicz7 and through him he is of polish and jewish descent    source    the more you know
  did you try using the blaster on them  they drop in seconds
  i tried this and its fucking great
  agree i was playing this on my voodoo 3 and then switched over to a geforce mx400 and not only does the geforce suck at quake ii but the game is not as good as quake although realizing i can hit f1 to shut the computer voice up was nice bonus compared to my child hood experience my god thats annoying
    doom  doom ii  quake i  quake ii  fight me irl if you disagree  quake ii is just boring quake i had an interesting setting and aesthetic and the gunplay was fun despite some enemies being too spongy
  the sound track is absolutely not better than dooms i cant hook up a sound canvas to quake or quake ii and make it sound balls to the wall good
  you liked hexen ii what about did you like i bought it new and found my self to be disappointed
  john romero  is a fucking moron with out the team telling him no your ideas are stupid he was a shit developer
    fucking this blowing out the enemies brains with a single shot is always going to be more fun than shooting them and then having to walk up to them to activate a press button to kill animation fuck
  this is cool thanks
  what you mean the infinite ammo starter pistol are they weak to it or something also wtf does nox mean
  what you mean  this    or try this    every powerful gun destroys them really    you where saving ammo for the powerful guns right anon you did not shoot super weapons on crap enemies for shit and giggles right    shooting 1 or 2 times to test it is when you get the gun ok however wasting them is not    i remember cutting down these fags like nothing in my games  you are talking about these guys right  
  i preferred this one personally and can be played lefthanded
  guys what file do you have to modify to change the resolution i am running under ubuntu  i need 1680x1050 thanks
    nice colors
  go into your baseq2 folder and create a file with a text editor called    autoexeccfg    edit this file and enter    set r_mode 1  set r_customwidth 1680  set r_customheight 1050   set cl_widescreen_fov 0  set fov 90     or if you are using opengl enter    set gl_mode 1  set gl_customwidth 1680  set gl_customheight 1050   set cl_widescreen_fov 0  set fov 90     save the file and run quake ii
  did anyone else have this problem
  hyperblaster / chaingun cuts through them like butter
quake 2s multiplayer is still active which suprised me while quake 1s mp is more dead than battleborn
  despite some enemies being too spongy  super nailgun and rocket launcher says hi
it might not be as innovative in storytelling as halflife but its an infinitely better playing game
opengl mode needs the mipmap settings altered so the textures dont look like they came from an n64 software looks sharper and better but doesnt have the gloomy look
  the pc version of quake ii reminded me of half life    levels such as the research lab launch command and power plant    quake ii is still the better game imo    
    the quake series is fucking garbage
  lmao    please stop with the contrarian thing this board is just getting laughable
quake ii is essentially the metroidvania of the series given that it has inter connected level design and you can visit previous areas the game itself is fast and fun even though i prefer some things about the original quake more
  so what did he use that he was saying they are to hard     what did he do with his ammo    
  the emulated psx version looks like ass next to the pc version even if you oversample and even taking into account the colors look at them side by side
  thinking your loved game is a bit shit despite being novel is not being contrarian halflife plays like ass
  yeah because quake 2 is perfection kys
  also see 
quake 2 is bland as fuck
modded q2 was the deathmatch game along with ut    build engine games were better sp experiences
  i thought it was very bland at first but once i played more older games and maybe became more openminded or closed depending on how you look at it i think the game has personality the rocking soundtrack and puke colour palette are actually used well in this game more than quake 1 imo and it fits well with the design actually creating a world within the levels is unique i think for the series and introducing the railgun although a bit cheap is still very fun to use perhaps an argument can be made that the enemy placements and enemy types are too simple in this game but the game overall is very enjoyable still and the pacing world design level design and weapon design are very fun i say and well done especially in comparison to other shooters i think its a good game by itself and even better when standing among other shooters like unreal gold or half life   my only comment of discontent is not being able to play quake 2 multiplayer with other people i imagine it would add to the game a lot one cool thing i noticed while roaming some quake 2 maps where that they had areas where you could crouch and access certain areas im not sure if this adds to the game but i say its a benefit over quake
  nailgun  hyperblaster  super nailgun  chaingun   q2 rl  q1 rl  q1 shotguns  q2 shotguns  over everything  railgun    q2 really hit the nail on weapons tho
  this is actually pretty much correct  i would like to add that doom 2 has better enemies and i liked the ssg as stupidly strong as it was but the maps / level design in general were shittier  so for me its doom / ultimate doom  doom ii  but i like plutonia / final doom tnt evilution a lot more than doom 2 almost as much as doom1    not him but even though it was not as good as hexen 1 but hexen 2 was badass loved the environments weapons rpg elements etc heretic was more of the doom but fantasy
  i liked the ssg as stupidly strong as it was  thats the brilliance of the ssg though its so powerful and generally enemies are comparatively weaker so to compensate you can throw a lot more enemies at the screen and really ramp up the excitement of the gameplay quake 1 and 2 completely dropped the ball in that regard with the spongy enemies to the point that its entirely unenjoyable
you faggots will never know what it was like to explore the 3d universe of quake and join a clan with 32 other people playing simultaneously when all of this was something the human race had never seen before
unpopular opinion but fps games on consoles are terrible bad fov sluggish auto aim    quake ii was incredibly good for the time but only on pc
  and fuck nin
glad to know im not the only one prefers quake iis music over i            even as a nin fan i could never get into the ambient shit of the first game even reznor himself said he considered quakes soundtrack more noise than actual music
  quake 1 doesnt really have music if you like generic school shooter rock thats fine but its possibly the most boring soundtrack ever in a 90s first person shooter
  unpopular opinion but fps games on consoles are terrible  hows that an unpopular opinion thats just a fact
  i enjoy that the school shooter rock since it actually sounds like music also it helps enjoy metal to begin with      the most boring soundtrack ever in a 90s first person shooter  anon i didnt post anything from halflife
i never played q1 however i played q2 and q3
  didnt one of the quake 2 expansions bring back the nailgun but it was called the flechete gun or something
  its great for coop also best 1990s modding scene
quake 2 weapons were fps kino and the natural evolution from doom quake 3 was simplified multiplayer bullshit    i miss the exotic weapons mod that made the minigun shoot rockets and the nuclear grenades that blew up half the map and the cluster bombs that would spam an area with grenades
quake is perfect for coop and needs more campaigns for me to download and play
  the enemies in quake 1 are kinda nice and simple doom like    quake 2 gives some possibilities to use advance ai so players can team up on enemies while theyre varied enough to give a challenge with ranged and melee    make quake 2 enemies like dark souls with lots of health and good dodge mechanics
  i miss the exotic weapons mod that made the minigun shoot rockets and the nuclear grenades that blew up half the map and the cluster bombs that would spam an area with grenades  links to mods or mode names my man i want to install this
  i cant remember if it was apocolyptic weapons or weapons factory or something planet quake is dead
  did you save the installer  always remember to have a archive of installers like this
nah its been awhile though id love to find it again    something that still exists and is worth making its own game for and becoming an e sport is qpong    its basically like rocket league but with quake where you shoot the ball to get it in a goal and also shoot other players    
  etf rifle in quakes second expansion ground zero is basically the nailgun    first expansion was much better though and the ion ripper is the shit
  was quake 2 ai really that advanced iirc it was exactly like quake 1 ai except enemies crouch sometimes
aesthetics  quake multiple themes unique dank brown evil  quake 2 all techbase generic repetitive grey  combat  quake satisfying exciting brutal  quake 2 slow unsatisfying even more bullet spongey  lighting  quake welllit with dramatic shadows  quake 2 dark with random spots of colored lighting almost no dramatic shadows  music  quake atmospheric experimental spooky  quake 2 constant annoying hard rock  modding  quake hugely popular to mod many went on to become full games many people still map for it to this day  quake 2 no mods with lasting legacy very few people still map  what the fuck went so wrong
  quake 2 lost the mod competition to halflife anyway poor q2
shinrei jusatsushi taromaru had a print run of 7600 copies which is higher than some mega drive or neo geo games games with more than 2000 copies i do not consider rare yet this game is close to 900 now what the fuck is wrong with this price same with batsugun and a few others these games cannot be rare as there are quite a few copies for sale always and its quite funny as there are games that are genuinely rare which can be picked up for next to nothing id say the shmups faggots are to blame
its really baffling to me that the simple concept of supply and demand throws everyone here into a tailspin to the point of anons making up ridiculous intricate conspiracies  it has a low supply and has a high demand  but there were other games with low supply as well and didnt cost this much  yes it didnt have such a high demand its not complicated
  its the same with hyper duel 500 and theres always 20 copies for sale on ebay    whats your source on there being 7600 copies anyway i heard it was 34k
  just emulate lmao  at least is not earthbound rare where the only ones elevating the price are the sellers themselves as for a 7600 copies game i would definitely call that rare
  always some dickhead who thinks we want capitalism explained for us the dude is venting  let him vent when you complain about your daughter giving head to a nigga would you like us to explain how hormones work
   that pic  than you for the keks sir
  i dont consider this game rare yet everyone else does and its expensive  whats wrong here  the young dumb fedroa tipper
is there a technical reason the characters have idle animations in re1 but not 2 like a memory issue or something always bothered me especially since leon and elza did have idle animations in the prototype
chris redfield  he was a little lacking in the sense of cooperation required among other special operations units such as swat although he acts under his own authority a lot he also solved many cases so for the moment his degree of punishment is lectures from wesker    the members of stars differ in equipment per individual although properly speaking all members should wear this stuff they have various reasons by the way the protector in this equipment was taken and became leons outfit in bio2    on holidays they go to the suburbs cause disturbances and come home left is chris joseph middle and forest right    rebecca chambers  the rookie of bteam an eccentric person whose talents were appreciated by chemical companies that scouted her one after another including umbrella but she declined all of them and joined stars the left is rebecca in her school days on holidays she goes to see basketball games with friends    chief brian is the most unpopular person with the raccoon police department sees abovementioned trio as enemies
enrico marini  enrico is barrys mentor he also serves as vicecaptain of stars and captain of bteam    barry burton  the man who enlisted chris into stars whenever chris does something brian complains to him every time    chris did something again  yeah    wesker leader of ateam and stars 38 years old same as barry    she receives training in marksmanship from chris several times a week since jill gets angry when he doesnt teach her firmly teaching is considerably serious for chris    yes another 200 shots    jill valentine  attached to ateam lockpicking is her specialty but its a mystery where and how she learned her techniques when chris asked her once she merely gave a dismissive answer    its a secret    guiding the child of a relative from japan around raccoon city  she often takes it easy at home on holidays and doesnt go out much
    rcpd slice of life this is cool thanks
  they also had clothing damage in the prototype the cut a lot of stuff
    any more stuff like this is always cool to read
  if i had to guess all the cuts were probably due to time constraints in the 2 years between re1 and re2 they scrapped the prototype and restarted from scratch    from what ive heard the prototype was going to be a much bigger game i want to know could capcom have been able to fit both the a and b scenarios on a single disc i always felt that the 2 disc thing was a massive gimmick like give each character their separate distinct scenario from the very beginning like theyre apparently doing for the remake
  never played these games before huge wuss is re1 directors cut on psx a good start so far 1 hr in and having fun
  yay
  it certainly is probably my second favorite entry in the series after the second one
  get the re1 directors cut that is not the dualshock version the dualshock version adds in terrible music
    apparently they cut that down in order to apply more detail to each individual model more zombies would appear on the screen in 15 too but they were less detailed i suppose
gonna give daggerfall a shot what do i need to know  thinking of being a nord since no imperial race when this game was made
  what do i need to know  its xbox hueg
  map is bigger than britain right  how shallow is it because of that
  about as shallow as it gets in 1996 with procedural generation as a new toy and the delusion that quantity  quality
  its terrible everything is static and flat with very little difference from cell to cell you will end up using fast travel before you know it and the map size wont make a single difference to your gameplay experience
use a huge mousepad so you can move your mouse around to a fro for combat
  fast travel is a staple of the series aside from morrowind
  some of the dungeons are bigger than oblivion its a terrible game with terrible design
daggerfall is a piece of shit hipster game play morrowind instead
  morrowind  arena  ultima underworld  daggerfall  skyrim     oblivion
  shit taste  oblivionskyrim  fallout nv fallout 3 morrowind everything else  morrowshi only has good lore and shit gameplay even fucking daggerfall has actual fast travel
    stfu
  replace fallout nv/fallout 3 with better games and i agree
  if you ever wondered why bethesda games are so fucking bad this game is your answer its here where all their company policies and decisionmaking was born  never understood why people cream their pants over this or any other of their title its always either massive empty world or just empty world and going back and forth
daggerfall  oblivion  battlespire  morrowind  gap  skyrim  fuck morrowind i could never get into that game  t zoomer
  daggerfall unity
  a shallow ocean
your race choice isnt that important its a bit bugged and your classs stats will override anything your race has  the exception is the high elfs resist paralysis and maybe the nords resist frost i cant remember any others    if you just want to mess around first to get the hang of things then go ahead and pick a default class but i recommend making your own class  i recommend choosing the disadvantage forbidden casting in daylight it might be called something different  any time you need magic its going to be in a dungeon 99 of the time and its never daylight in dungeons if you need magic outside its probably to unlock a door so youll be out there at night sneaking around anyway this disadvantage provides no real disadvantage though your magic power is almost always 0 when you arrive somewhere which is annoying but it will give you more freedom to choose more advantages
  there is some decent depth in your reputation and standing between kingdoms and factions and certain nobles but overall you will not explore or go to a sizable chunk of the map unless you go out of your way to in a sense its great because it makes you feel small like youre in a big world you wot see or experience all of it and mostly it doesnt care about you its a total reversal in modern games where everyone knows youre some kind of super chosen one sent by the gods to save the universe and they all want to line up and suck your dick
  really good disadvantages to pick are forbidden armor types like leather and chain because plate is way better and low level materials like iron and steel because youll use high level materials later and dwarven because its rare as hell and theres so much better stuff if youre a high elf you can also choose critical weakness paralysis and nothing will happen because your racial bonus against paralysis will override your class weakness but youll gain a ton of useful disadvantage points
the meme is real
burgertime is a japanese game though
  op btfo
  when our first intellivision died we got this bundle that version of the game was so damn good dozens and dozens of unique level layouts
i met the vp of sales for data east usaback in the 80s around 2009ish he works for allstate selling insurance he had more than a few gaming mags from the era with his picture in them to prove his id he claimed he was the one who came up with the name burgertime since they were worried about being unable to trademark hamburgerthe original jp name
  sounds like a weird thing to be worried about atari didnt have any issues trademarking centipede did they
  why do amerifats love burgers so much is it because they are so fat
  other way around
  burger here  just ate a burger  might eat another
  the names of plants and animals have a special protection you can always use them for your business or product names
  american here just at a 13 burger can you people in other countries even afford dinners like this it was so greasy and delicious i would have taken a pic if id known about this thread beforehand
  my first console got it second hand from a guy down the street who upgraded to a nes     came with   burgertime  mission x  advanced dnd  treasure of tarmin  sub hunt  buzz bombers  skiing  beauty and the beast     very comfy childhood got a second hand coleco vision a few months after dad bought it from a guy at work and thought id like it got a sms for christmas a year or two later sms was big in australia
  source the ass a 12 yo wannabe laywer
  its got the most going for it  that is one lazy ass slogan
  to be fair pressure cooker for the atari vcs was a very good game

first collab square gets done right as life hits me with a freight trains worth of business
  is oldshoes modpack from 14 for sc4 viable ive read it has bunch of mods that are exclusive to each other
  we should test them out i have no experience with sc4 mods always wanted to mod that game its the most complete sim city even if the earlier games are more charming    i wish sc3k had a designated agricultural zone it had really comfy farms but they were prone to developing into other bullshit if you didnt keep their strict requirements or you could mark every single square historical but thats far too tedious for more than a couple of plots
  i dont think cedar point will ever get rid of that ride just because its historically important and looks fucking great you can see it down the midway from the front end of the park
  it was the prior version that had compatibility issues the 14 pack is fine after oldshoe was noted about the issues with it however there are a lot of packs in circulation labelled as oldshoes so your safe bet is getting those that are clearly marked as the 14 version or taken from his own page
    i too have never played sc4 but i played the crap out of sim city on snes sc2k and sc3k i thought they went downhill after sc3k so im surprised to hear people praising it care to elaborate more on the good  bad of it
  i thought they went downhill after sc3k so im surprised to hear people praising it  the new simcity sucks in almost every way possible but 4 is generally considered the pinnacle of the series
  they should not its iconic they could of course retrack it or get new trains to improve the experience or even demolish it and keep the corkscrews as a sculpture
tfw constructor was supposed to come out on the switch and they kept pushing it back and said its supposed to come out on oct 30th  tfw still not out and the devs arent even bothering coming up with an excuse as and are now just deleting peoples posts    i just wanted building games on my switch _
  sim city 4 is more realistic than sc3k especially in that driveways connect to the road aside from that its on a much larger scale since you can build many cities in a region and connect them allowing you to simulate larger areas than just a single city i liked it because building a regional highway system was rewarding especially when looking at it on the region view     sim city 4 is the last good sim city game after sim city 4 rush hour came out there were no good city building games for almost 10 years
lfg      also i posted my slot on ned but unfortunately they noticed that my square is really only 75 asphalt and a coaster      4chan is more important than real life yo
start scenario  splash boats researched  infinite money  is there any more broken ride
  start marketing campaign for splash boats 1  terraform entire map into a flat plain in less than a year  build more splash boats
  hello its me oldshoes    the modpack is self contained nothing too wild lots of stuff that looks vanilla lots of details growables    download nam as its not included         sc3ku and sc4 are the goats i find 3k better for more casual plays where i can make a city in a day or two and be done with it where sc4 regions can take weeks spent detailing
got some progress done for my indoor lim coaster in my woodstock park toke some inspiration from disney paris space mountain with the cannon like tube and having it go on the moon but i thought of instead of being completely in the dark its under this glass roof i was pleasantly surprised to see the glass walls can be sloped
  also to be clear anything that needs a dependency has it included in the download if something is missing i fucked up
spend hours working on an openttd scenario  accidentally save over it with a blank map    might as well an hero
  whoa is that a shipyard with a fucking road connection holy shit
grow up poor only really went to a local theme park drievliet in the hague nld  play rct2  favourite map is six flags holland now walibi because we could never go there even though it was the park  finally go to walibi a few years back  its a huge disappointment  one hour long wait for a fifteensecond roller coaster  fucking packed everywhere  cant enjoy theme parks at all now due to not enjoying large crowds  discover orct2  boot it up  get those nostalgic feels again why do i never go to parks anymore  oh right  anyone else know this feel i used to love going to them i semienjoy going to drievliet duinrell and efteling but i hate the fuckhueg crowds and my family and feel im getting to old for them and im in my early twenties    worst part is that the six flags holland map is more funlooking than the actual fucking reallife park
  getting too old for amusement parks  im so sorry that those parks have given you that kind of feeling im sure there are better experiences to be had than the ones youve been too the only time ill wait an hour for a rollercoaster is if its fucking steel vengeance or some shit
  how were they that long i recently went to disney world at florida last week and space mountain tower of terror test track especially for single riders splash mountain thunder mountain rock and roller coaster and expedition everest were under one hour most of the times for me it was the seven dwarves mine pandora attractions and the slinky rollercoaster that were constantly borderline over one hour    does it have to do with lesser optimization with ride capacity/efficiency
  feels bad man no auto saves
  eh its just that the average age is a teenager and it makes me want to go back to those years as i practically wasted them especially if theyre on dates    the biggest problem for me isnt even the wait times its the crowds im not too comfortable with them and i dislike going with my family as i come form white trash with zero sense of shame      probably just the demand because its the countys biggest and best and thus everyone needs to go into them at least thrice or some shit i just hate the waiting in fuckhueg lines especially when i compare the actual time the fucking rides take looking at you goliath you too condor  they didnt take an exact hour usually but the wait time usually says 1 to 15 hours and but it averaged about 45 minutes i know the times are inflated but when im there for about 6 to 7 hours id like to do more then spend only 20 minutes in rides and 6 hours waiting in lines    on a positive note i loved movie park germany when i was last there in 2012 we went there in the early spring so it was reasonably empty
  go on the school days / offpeak season at some uk parks you have zero wait so you can ride the top rides over and over in a row the wait times on some of these can exceed 2hrs normally
  solo trips on off days my friend an amusement park is there to cater to everyone not just the young the first page of the rct handbook says as much
    good tips wouldnt you look like a creep going to a theme park alone though    side note did they ever fix the retarded swanboat ai
  not really many parks have single rider lines too so they can get to the front faster just sat next to a random person
  single rider lines  never heard of those must be an american thing
  six flags has those and disabled lines  why disabled lines i dont know
    i waited 2 hours and 40 minutes to go on dododonpa at fujiq which is a ride under 1 minute long  cant say it was worth it    universal in osaka had these nowhere else did though
  i dont think they fixed it on a recent openrct2 build i built various boat types and was plagued with them getting lost or stuck
  tfw people build cities like that  tfw you just make a 10x10 grid of city blocks  i literally cant force myself to any other design than just adding identical rectangle blocks
  why is it so anon
  if i remember correctly theres a single rider line on lost gravity
  it helps to not have a huge trip required then you can go during the off season right at opening stay for a couple hours and get a decent fill before the lines get too long and the place gets crowded
  literally no one will care that youre there alone the smaller your group is the faster you can get around and being solo is the quickest because you make the decisions want to stop and get food who the fuck is going to stop you no one its your trip treat yourself
    yeah they already ruined my favorite roller coaster ever    rip my friend your new look just isnt the same
    whoops this  was meant for 
    oooo that looks neat nice
  indeed and its included in the modpack      keep the grids just make them irregular shapes that conform to the terrain everything in pic is a grid functionally a central avenue with only roads connecting to it and streets only connect to roads creating a funnel into the avenues
  new detroit  i love you anon
  hey what was wrong with the old one  oh right
more progress done on apollo 11 good lord is working with translucent walls a pain in the ass sometimes
finally its done
  yes i know pain
  mean streak was a beautiful wooden coaster but it aged poorly please dont judge steel vengeance because it doesnt look as cool its a good ride and a worthy successor to mean streak
  germany aswell got 7 consecutive rides on pic related 15 total yesterday even though i spent most time on other rides with my group  wasnt even a schoolday just forecast rainy but no actual rain happened
  nice you should probably build other rather large buildings around it so that it does not stand out give it a station and build a station for the monorail
  wasnt even a schoolday  1 nov is a holiday in germany        amazing good job
which railroad tycoon is the best one
  1 nov is a holiday in germany  in the states arround the park it is
  i personally feel like every simcity after sc2k added too much complexity and it quickly got bogged down and became less fun sc3k and sc4 are better simulations sure but theyre not as fun of games to me
  wouldnt you look like a creep going to a theme park alone   because  ive worked a summer job during uni times in a theme park as a security guard roughtly quarter of all visiters were solo
  2 and its not even a question
  no idea i think its simply because it works and there is no real reason to not build grid while in the same time i dont exactly see the benefit of doing it in other shapes than the easiest one then comes the fact my neighbourhood is all of irregular shapes oneway lines and it looks nice on paper but is horrible to drive through or even walk through in certain parts of it due to aesthetics taking precedense over functionality      i just build a regular grid instead cant fit due to terrain simply not building there besides irregularities look even worse than just standard grid
    oh ive ridden steel vengeance and it was awesome i just never loved a coaster as much as i loved mean streak so its always gonna have that feeling stuck to it 
    that looks so fucking cool i wish i wasnt so impatient with scenery so i could build things like this too
am i playing this right
    kek
  maybe
  your savagery knows no bounds
  thats what i intend to do i wanted it to be a centre building like an icon sort of like how spaceship earth is an icon for epcot the monorail is still in progress and im thinking of it to go into buildings like the people mover in tomorrowland
  but why is there a nam folder in the zip then  also im a retard who never modded the game do i just dump it in the install folders plugins folder
  supply demand    shouldnt the market fix this why dont we have more theme parks
  opening a new theme park must be a massive fucking gamble
  because the zip includes mods that add to nam but not nam itself
  i am unfamiliar with this what are the rules can anyone join in  ive been playing rct since it came out so im no nub
  they probably need the obnoxious patronride ratio for concession sales to keep them profitable
  what are the rules  dont touch others areas  can anyone join in  absolutely  ive been playing rct since it came out so im no nub  theres no skill requirements whatsoever
  not to mention a gigantic financial drain great roller coasters cost millions of dollars
  pick one slot build your slot and dont overlap other slots but building over green spaces is okay when done post your file and pass it on to the next player
  why dont we have more theme parks  we have loads of theme parks tho most countries have several
  anon the clear implication is that long lines means there is in fact not loads of parks relative to the population
  we had 1 one in hungary which was closed a couple of years ago  tfw ancient rides    intense af  
  at least the old wooden rolercoaster remains    that thing is like a perfect balance between mild enjoyment and a genuine fear for your life
aaa
  they should really get morgan to do a rework of the ride like they did with arrows steel phantom i say that as someone who has never really been a fan of arrow customer loopers though i think people just care about the double corkscrew so as long as they keep that most people wont complain
  being an adult is the best time to go to amusement parks you actually have money so you can buy what ever the hell you want best of all you can go during the off days when everything will be a walk on its just one of those things that becomes much better to do once you are an adult like cruise ships
  what country are you in
  do you guys concider openttd retro
  ttd was released 1995 as long as ottd resemble to original its retro
  sourceports and mods of retro games count
  did someone say gatekeeper
  wait what the fuck what is industry giant and why does it look like transport tycoon is it good or better than ttd or what
  am i playing right
  the only escape is death
bumpercoaster
    i love creating torture mazes and then putting the people who manage to get out in an isolated part of the park where all the food and drinks are free and theres a 3d cinema or something to keep them happy for eternity unless theyve reached the point of no return and keep thinking i want to go home and refuse to eat drink or go on any rides then i just drown them
im not too great at building cute/pretty things cause i just dont know how but im pretty satisfied with this little lim i built
  rest of the park atm
  its quite neat it would look better with a brake run and a small cover for the station
  i love when people give desert maps a lot of terraforming work
heres a free screenshot for yaall now please stop fighting about conspiracy theories
  tthanks
  what didnt he like about that lift
anyone here tried megaquarium i only just learned the game exists and the ratings look pretty good to me
  at least it looks retro
    i love it it very much plays like a classic tycoon game and has great attention to detail for all the fish and how they interact with each other i love too how the map isnt reset either i think it needs some better guest interaction and detail like how the gift shop is just a book shelf and there arent real food stalls
  no clue it was the first test run and at the end he calls it good maybe he just happemed to move like this
    the one where you go outside in the sun
  no
  is this really a better money farm than corkscrews
  ive been meaning to check this out but i always worry about modern games based on genres that have fallen to the wayside they always copy some aspects while leaving others out throwing off the whole experience in the process
  definitely this
  i wouldnt know but it was in one of openrct2s title screen scenarios theyre on the ride for a shorter time and theyre not bogged down by limited car space
  better put some benches at the exits so they can sit down after that ass reaming
  very nice
what amusement parks have ever charged money to use the bathroom has anyone ever peed their pants at an amusement park because they ran out of money and couldnt use the toilet
    probably way back when but who cares thats part of the fun
  i know a few countries around the world have paid toilets in public places i forget what theyre called but theyre usually wellmaintained and clean because of it
  those mainly exist for tourists to my knowledge
current breakdown station brakes failure
so i checked out simcity 3000 and im starting to get used to it transitioning from 4 how does one stimulate commecial growth in this i keep getting abandoned buildings and keeping the taxes low and trying to increase land value doesnt seem to do the trick much
  honestly by far the simplest thing i can suggest is to read through the written lets play of sc3k that was done by the deadly hume from something awful years ago hes pretty obviously a top tier expert at the game and carefully explains the processes and everything he does while crafting this very nice and large city    you can find it on lparchive
  you need to build population at a certain number demand shifts from industrial to commercial focus on building those residential zones and the commercial demand will come later    other general tips parks are good for raising land value locally and airports raise commercial demand just keep them far away the pollution is a drawback
  last world record broken in 2003    500ft drop coaster when
  500 foot cable lift full circuit coaster when
that faggot who designed the euthanasia coaster could have made it much cheaper if he used helices instead of loops
  is it possible to build a city this big in 4 without building at any other spot in the region i have a feeling that was what i was doing wrong all those years
    that mechanic who just didnt quite get there in time and the fruitless clank clank clank of his hammer echoes post explosion
    thanks anons kinda fucked up by zoning a bigass airport space that somehow didnt fully develop into one with a huge gap in the middle so that i technically have two airports now kind of a bummer if i zone anything too near them and the land value plummet massively because of it the airport somehow solved almost every traffic problems near instantly weirdly enough but i guess itll sooner reduce a lot of pollution
  i think you can build a complete standalone city in the largest city size in sc4 you just kind of lose the benefits of having multiple cities in the region
i dont know if you guys remember me from back in may when i gave away a link for my birthday but parkitect 10 release date set for nov 29th    release trailer they just put out      so because i love this game so much and you guys here is an updated and last beta build before it releases at the end of the month        hope you all enjoy
  what a shitty trailer but im hyped for release anyway was a while since i played so its probably time to get back into it
  thanks i remember you 3
youre all newbies you all sux  the real management game is gangsters
  the real management game is gangsters  nah man theres only one true management game out there  shame that in over 20 years now ive never found anyone to do the multiplayer with
  i remember playing a demo of that game as a kid absolutely clueless as to what im supposed to be doing
  im dutch as well and i feel you the only really fun times i had at an amusement park were when it wasnt busy at all i think the only reason i said i liked amusement parks as a kid was because it was supposed to be fun     my fondest memories of amusement parks are the times when my mom went as well walibi holland is really fun during fright nights you should try it sometime most people forget about the rides during halloween i went like 4 years in a row
  does pic related play linkin park and evanescence
  something better    imagine standing in line with that on loop for 2 hours
  holy shit this is edgier than i imagined
  some industrial metal vibes that prompts me to listen to zynthetic again
    hd version for switch was supposed tocome out over a year and a half ago  devs keep pushing it back  now silent and deleting peoples posts asking where the switch version is
  you should try it again now as an adult its got that old great 90s bullfrog sense of humour dungeon keeper / theme hospital era the mechanics are tight as a drum and its very hard but completely fair ive never once been handed a win on a silver platter like easier games sometimes do nor lost the game and felt that it was anything but my own fuckup of unduly rushing the situation faster than i was able to keep pace with
  off topic a bit but i like just tracking my swan rides and hiding the track elements    looks a little goofy in motion sometimes but makes for good screencaps
  which one should i get constructor or mob rule
fucking had a long comment typed out and fumbled my keyboard so its all gone now    constructor itself i cant speak for mob rule        the gog version works fine i havent gotten around to properly trying out the steam version or the modern remake my backlog is too big but the old devs are around and kicking still if you want to give them your money and have a steam version etc    the games a bit tricky to get into if youre flying completely blind so if you want a mini guide on how to get a stable start going and where you should progress from there with general tips etc i can absolutely do that for you honestly constructor has arguably been my 1 fave game of all time for a long time and ive played a lot of games
  meant for    thanks for eating my first message and making me slightly fuck up the second one 4chan
    thanks for the links and the heads up i guess ill manage anything to note about the hd release just wondering if i should get that one as well
  there is a remake tho  
  there is a remake tho  see    or the modern remake  i talked about it more in my original post that got swallowed couldnt be bothered to a second time
  anything to note about the hd release  from what ive tried of it which wasnt for long as i dont have the time admittedly atm it seemed like a faithful reconstruction of the original and the only thing that was missing was a pause button i could mouse click instead of just a hotkey for it    this was back in march entirely possible its changed since then couldnt tell you if its got any bugs or anything but in the hour i played it was stable
    lots and lots of dlc and new buildings thats about it
  aesthetics over functionality  i believe some neighborhoods are deliberately designed to resemble a spaghetti bowl to force vehicles to slow down for safety reasons if a neighborhood has a reputation of kids getting splattered all over the road due to speed demons blazing down a road at 50mph it wont attract new families to te neighborhood
  buy/pirate the gog release its patched for compatibility
  gog isnt a magic fix and their patches arent that robust  there is often still some issues even if it runs
  true but ive found that the gog release of sc3000 and unlimited runs perfectly fine on windows 7 and windows 10 whereas trying to install an old cd release just brought about endless woes and crashes   i couldnt make the cd installs behave no matter what i did while the gog installs would always behave    i recommend it in this specific situation based on my own experiences whether you want to buy it or not is up to you i even suggest pirating in case you dont want to give gog money its worth a shot
  the problems described apply to the gog release too anon which was the point
  oh then i must have misread its late i apologize  i guess works on my machine isnt a particularly satisfying reply
  from my vague memory of trying it in the past i remember getting annoyed by all the micromanagement you had to do to keep tenants happy while the cpu just happily built whatever with all its cheated money
  the cpu always cheats a bit about the only way it can keep level with a human being true of almost any game    as for micromanagement as long as you avoid the neediest of tenants and preempt their complaints by including every garden with two trees a fence and whatever else that tenant type likes to whine about then generally speaking the only complaints you get are the occasional stop running that factory day and night or whatever
would anyone be interested in sharing landscapes in sc3k to build on the terrain generator is nice but im tired of building on the various generated terrain options
  hang in there
is openrct multiplayer stable enough to have /vr/ct weekly collabs or something    i recently got access to hosting on a gigabit uplink looking for some cool shit to do
  yes its come a long way since the beginning players will occasionally have to reconnect to resync everything with the server but other than that its reliable enough
  public servers with no restrictions are kind of the wild west however openrct2 has so many tools that you could either have a really pleasant park or you could have jim bob nobody come in and play around with the scenery removal tool kind of hit or miss
  guess they never miss huh
does anyone else create a floating platform in the middle of the lake/ocean and put all their dissenting guests on it  sometimes i also put all the sick people there so i dont have to hire more handimen
      lets give it a shot    /tcg/ /vr/ct weekly collab server  scenario paradise island  with some modifications  server shortlinkclub11753 also published on the server list  password lemonade      there are regular autosaves enabled but take your own backups if you care to as well    i dont tend to have an abundance of free time but ill be playing this afternoon at least and ill leave it running for a week or so or until it reaches its natural conclusion    join if you want
  those top hats  yikes talk about a maintenance nightmare
  is that a mother fucking togo in the front got a better picture of it      yall  its yall      yeah i remember having to pay money to use the toilets in paris that was in the 90s though
  so its like a multiplayer tycoon game that gives me the idea for a competitive sim city like your opponent builds an airport at the edge of his city boundary and you zone skyscrapers at the edge of your city boundary by the runway to fuck with him
  it can certainly be played multiplayer yeah and you can send a psycho to attack their tenants fence with a chainsaw or hypnotize their foreman into coming for a ride with your deranged clown etc its great      i never actually have any human players to play the multiplayer with but oh well theres the ai
    i know i will probably get shit on but sim city 2013 multiplayer was super fun i really wish someone would make another multiplayer tycoon game like that
speaking of multiplayer did anyone here have a chance to play sim city 2000 network edition
  my problem with sim city 2013 wasnt the multiplayer it was pretty much everything else about the game
  just a headsup for anyone on the server the 1920s race cars are bugged and sometimes stop working i changed them to traditional gokarts
  same    building cities with others had me super stokes    then the game successfully ground my heart into the dirt
playing on the server  keep getting notifications about guests needing to use the restrooms  add in a few more just to get it to stop  it keeps giving me the alert so i check the price  someone had jacked up the admission  haha what a dick
  i learned a very valuable lesson with that game and that was to watch out for people using nostalgia to separate you from your money
  im dumb idk what togo is
      type of roller coaster
  its a kind of late 20th century torture device originating from japan
  to give a little more context togos rollercoasters have not aged well and are regarded as roughriding pieces of shit these days but they were responsible for a lot of innovation when they were around
interesting that arrow is held in higher regard than togo their track is just as rough
  arrow doesnt have an obvious meme coaster that even an idiot can look at from a distance and see that it looks like a bad idea
  looping suspended coaster
  and yet nobody memes on it quite like the togo standup so its obviously not as big of a meme as that
  on paper the slc does not look that bad desu the real crime is that they built more than 40 installations of the fucking things
  that was about the swinging suspended looping coaster that was only prototyped hang and bang slcs are only bad because of the track same as their other coasters
speaking of slcs and togo standups whats your worst coaster experience mine is image related an absolutely unforgettable experience however i do not even remember the inversions because i was so busy not getting hurt in spite of my efforts the fucking thing smashed one of my earrings so badly that it started bleeding      there was a swinging looping coaster
  one of my earrings  with head restraints  you foolish fool
  there was a swinging looping coaster  got you covered
  my worst coaster experience was blue streak at cedar point when i was age 11 i was a very tiny child so the violent ride pretty much destroyed me i must have weighed less than 100 pounds at that time    its my favorite wooden coaster now because ive put on some weight since then and can appreciate rollercoasters properly
  that empty parking lot
  heres a fun game try to find your car when youre on the blue streaks turnaround
  what an abomination
  youve seen nothing
  moar
  i think thats the same rollercoaster i climbed in nevada to shoot at escaped convicts from
  it still gets me every time how the fuck does anybody design this and think its ok let alone actually building it the absolute madman
    undoubtedly this was my worst experience on a roller coaster which is funny because i thought it couldnt get any worse after i road cyclone and thought i was going to die of an aneurysm i dont know who designed the bolt on overhead restrains they added to the old revolution cars but they were so high up that your head was right between them instead of them resting on your shoulders around every turn my head started fucking pinballing back and forth between them thump thump thump thump thump i swear to god my vision was blurry when i got off of it
    i swear the head knocking has to be the most overlooked thing in modern restraint systems im sure concussions are super common and the primary factor in people puking after rides not full stomachs it has to be a myth
    lol its like an rct track in real life wtf
    it typically isnt a problem at least where ive been usually they are designed to rest on the shoulders in a position that helps cushion any shaking that or the head rest absorbs most of the movement revolution was once just lap restraints and the headrests are flat and not comfortable that mixed with how poorly attached the newer restraints were was a recipe for a noggin joggin    tho i know they recently gave it some upgrades so it may not be an issue anymore but ive never seen new revolution so i dunno
  my spine aches just looking at it
        yikes yea its an ultra twister i built it for filler cause why not it looks neat
  tfw /vr/ct is dying  like 3 people in this thread know actual shit about coaster manufacturers
    ayyy fellow dutchies  i have an efteling year pass and toverland year pass  i visit efteling every week sometimes even more    btw stay away from the halloween fright nights if youre visiting for the rides it is super fucking crowded
 is dead
  new revolution is back to lap bar restraints its pretty all right though i havent bothered with the vr
  ive been here since the very start of the first threads back around 2012 or 2014 when everyone mostly just fucked around with 1 tile hedge mazes min size go karts and 20 umbrellas and i only know what the memes say desu
dependencies ruin simcity 4 for me otherwise id never have stop playing
  is this parkitect
  every time i see this atrocity i wonder how it even completes a circuit     what do you mean can you elaborate a bit
  _
  mods for simcity 4 depend on other mods the process of finding the mods required to use a mod is tedious and irritating from what i hear
    yes comes nov 29th
  so you dont know what a schwarzkopf or an arrow is
  i just enjoy the game and only recently learned there even was an rct general i have learned some new things while here tho so theres that
  pretty much my knowledge of rollercoasters begins and ends with riding 3 or 4 diff coasters in my life and thats about it
  the art of twisting steel to amuse people for a minute or two is a fascinating science and learning how each manufacture influenced other manufacturers is a read i would highly recommend delving in to
  every time i see this atrocity i wonder how it even completes a circuit    you just gotta go fast
  this
  thats wood even more amazing
trying to get openttd to run on my windows 98 cf27 and i just cant make it past this screen opengfx and sfx are in the right place and if i copy it onto my windows 7 pc the game runs completely normally it is the windows 9x version so i dont know why it wont work please help friends    i will note other games like diablo 2 run completely fine on it
  oldshoes modpack has all dependencies for all mods included just need nam installed separately     
    god wooden roller coasters are so damn cool
  sorry ill get it back up soon
intamin is building a noninverting cobra roll on a hyper coaster style ride  have science gone to far
  its buildable and only look slightly retarded in rct
    so would anyone here be up for trying constructor in a multiplayer environment im absolutely up for such a thing if anyone here wants to join me
  now lower the drop height so you dont get excitement penalties from intensity and show us the stats
  where my sim/yoot tower niggas at
  hi there
  yeet my nig
  sorry i cant hear you over all the ols blasting music through their phone speakers as they stomp up and down the hallway
hey i just started playing simcity 4 again after not playing since i was a kid i cant figure out how to get the really massive skyscrapers to appear i thought it had something to do with having multiple cities but its not happening for me not sure why but i think this game is still better than cities skylines as a game and simulation
  i dont like it
  place some highdensity commercial or residential areas give your citizens incentive to move/set up businesses there by building roads hospitals police/fire stations schools parks etc and then just wait alternatively you can just choose which building gets built where via cheats but i forget how since its been a while    there was a great set of simcity 4 guides by some guy who also liked to build some pretty impressive looking cities in minecraft
    actually during a recent interview some sales dude from rmc said that they are able to build a 400500ft coaster with their trex track
zoo time
  the only question is are there any madmen out there willing to call them on that       thats comfy as hell i wish i had tried building on smaller maps more i always wanted to build on the biggest maps when i played zoo tycoon and the things i built always sprawled out like crazy
  cedar point is celebrating their 150th anniversary 2020 one can dream
  thats a brilliant reason to build a 500 foot coaster  topping 150 meters for the 150th anniversary
  the only problem is that it is so soon rmc have not built a single trex yet and it doesnt feel likely that theyll build a 150m tall prototype coaster desu
  skyscrapers need educated sims and time to grow cant make a new city and just go boom skyscrapers      i will post them
  ignore the stuff about plugin packs on these i dont think the links work anymore since i made these in 2010/11    i do however have another modpack detailed in this post 
im happy a bunch of you pitched in for the collab i threw together last week     full pic     do we want to do another one ideas for a scenario or map to play    current server is still up at  server shortlinkclub11753 default  pass lemonade
  how about arid heights or something with no time limit again id like to see something hosted from the /vr/ct pack something people on 4chan have made
  hey we did it
    reeee why does it keep freezing i just want to try before i buy
  sounds good i saw a few people are still toodling around after i linked it again ill switch out the scenario sometime tomorrow and go through the trouble of wget and tar to pull the vpack and other goodies onto the server
is amity airfield hard or am i just retarded
what rollercoasters let me bump threads
  sounds good you should set the scenario to long lake metropark elynn forest pratt falls or set sail for hail those are good for longterm play with large maps that would work well on a server
  its fucking hard as tits in a blizzard      also santas enchanted forest is open in miami if youre down there be sure to pay a visit the largest moveable wheel and the best portable coaster in the us is waiting for you as well this is the first and only huss frisbee straight from germany is there for the first time the best rides in the us and all on one ticket its the best thing in florida south of orlando tell them walt sent you
  failed it on my first try too basically its a lesson in building quickly and efficiently and taking advantage of the generous 50k loan bandwidth once you have the vertical drop coaster researched spam those with as many trains possible great stats and you can charge a high price and pay off your loan to build more just keep building and of course run campaigns
  its probably the most challenging scenario in the first two games and their expansions
bump
going trough your screenshots can be fun
in simcity 3k is it possible to get enough land value etc for high density to develop fully on a miniature map on small
  hot damn
  i dont see why not
  yup
what have you been building /tcg/
i know this isnt exactly the best thread to ask but since the shill actually done right shilling and the experts are here how are you guys finding parkitect i kinda wanna buy it but i wanna know if the campaign fizzles out and just becomes repetitive rct and the like really are all about the scenarios for me so how are they the sandbox side seems to be all there on parkitect though
  neat which mode is this i havent poked too much around all the things you can do in openrct2 yet
its almost 2019  mcbrs are still flat  theres literally no reason you cant put it on a hill for example
  openrct2 still doesnt have diagonal brakes yet
  take a look
  actually when you dig deep into sc4 its a shitty pollution maintenance simulator where you either are forced to reindustrialize all your dirty i late game never have dirty i and just go slow as fuck with commercial jobs only or do some bullshit crossregion exploit     if the game at least gave you a more economically viable clean energy option early game this would be more forgiveablebut all i end up doing in the game every damn time is trying to speedrush education to unlock hightech industries asap and then spending the next hour reversing all my environmental damage that i should be allowed to avoid in the first place with careful planning /rant
  dude you can play with wind power only until you get solar and just raise tax on dirty industry so you only get manufacturing
  lol
  sounds like real life
  still learning this and trying out new stuff most cities are a mess but i did attempt to sort try and theme some of them    ive encountered an odd bug though sometimes as seen in the picture the thumbnail is the last screen it still works fine and another save fixes it most times but i havent managed to figure it out
does anybody else find smooth graphs satisfying    ive changed from building long lines to making circular ones just for this makes me feel like im a business man who actually knows what he is doing
    set up msn internet a
  sc4 is full of weird as shit bugs i made my own region and sometimes city thumbnails just fucking break
  also while were on the topic of sc4 importing regions is archaic too i downloaded that region and the file was a couple of images the game really shows its age when you start looking at it from a technical standpoint
  that ride used to travel on the german funfair circuit
ten
rip
  i just laughed for a solid 2 minutes at this
  it saddens me that xbox huge has been forgotten
  as long as you remember its not truly forgotten anon
not torturing peeps  
  nice shilling of your gay video faggot
  no its a traffic management strategy game the pollution is easy to manage commuters/freight are the real challenge of sim city 4
whats your opinion of throne of bhaal     after the frantic crisscrossing of quests in soa i initially enjoyed the linear dungeon crawling but eventually got tired of one boss fight after another and no town or village locations to just dick around in the art wasnt as good as bg2 either     the viconia romance is epic though
beamdog is guilty of a number of different crimes here are the major ones    1 the enhanced editions are herp dee derp ung derpa ding derp a berp la derp herp derp derp herp herp derp herp herp and derp    2 the games didnt derp ahperp palaperp derp sherp perp derp herp derp merhp herp derp herp hurr durr herr    3 the infamous 600 derp derp herp derp derp durr dunkaderpadeedoordeedoodaperdeerreeedepeereenoderp durr hurr durr herp herpa herp    4 this is where we get to herp durr hurr durr herp herpa herp aherp durr hurr durr herp herpa herp durr hurr durr herp herpa herp derp durr durr hurr durr herp herpa herp herpa derp durr herp derp    5 siege of motherfucking dragonspear
  you i like you
  whats your opinion of throne of bhaal   its a good ending to the saga and is primarily tailored for fans of combat the definitive way to enjoy it nowadays is with the ascension mod though because it includes the lead writers david gaider before he became a keyboard warrior personal fixes to the plot that make it more interesting and also includes much more tactically interesting combat so the first member of the final five isnt a literal tutorial that you shouldnt need at this point with ascension the final confrontation truly feels epic
    c r i n g e
  i agree with you completely highend dd combat just isnt that good imo theres really nothing to look forward to progressionwise anymore just another insane spell or hla as you cruise from one empty encounter to the next cant relax anywhere because theres just fireballs coming down nonstop the story and villain arent compelling like in soa i skip it most of the time and the 2 times i played tob i felt no sense of accomplishment
  it gave us watchers keep which is a good dungeon
beamdog is a guilty of a number of different crimes here are the major ones    1 the enhanced editions are essentially a collection of free mods that had existed for nearly twenty years beamdog gathered them all up slapped enhanced edition on it and resold it as a new product theres very very little in the enhanced editions that wasnt already out there and most of it is stuff you dont want like obnoxious character outlines    2 the games didnt sell so well and the originals were still far outselling them even twenty years after their release so beamdog had every digital distributor stop selling the originals and only sell the enhanced edition if you want to buy a digital copy of the originals now theyre bundled into the enhanced edition now these scumbags can claim sales from people just wanting to buy the originals as their own    3 the infamous 600 bugs on launch the game is still riddled with bugs as even a perfunctory glance over their forums show but the fact that it took nearly two years for them to get a game that had been working fine for 20 years to reach playability after launch is telling of their wild incompetence    4 this is where we get to the ones that really piss people off beamdog couldnt just remaster the game they had to fuck with the content too new dialogue for existing npcs like jaheira viconia safana kivan et cetera was written in to make the characters more progressive and leftist friendly beamdog shills will argue that adding content isnt changing content xddd but it is when the new content changes the core personalities of the existing characters this is in addition to adding a slew of their own lgbt hitherto there were none in baldurs gate npcs all flooded with op attributes and magic items to encourage people to play them despite their cancer    5 siege of motherfucking dragonspear
  kys you fucking fag autist just to let you know im a nigger with lots of money and each time i see one of these i purchase and gift a copy while you fucking masturbate to anime and keep a wacth on 4chan for any related thread to post your faggot pic kek      tob is too linear for my taste its just an excuse to fight powerful bosses and tackle dungeons with overpowered gear/characters the story concludes ok i guess but to me the game loses its charm
  i enjoyed it anything is better than the structure of soa really
  buy me a copy of bgee pls
  the structure of soa feels almost exactly like playing an actual table top game not saying that makes it good but i never really appreciated until i tried the real thing
  the writing and game design feel like post bg bioware you can definitely see how this turns into something like kotor whereas soa feels like it is from a different developer    add2e is not designed for levels above 20 and combat boils down to popping ultimate moves which is kind of fun for a bit but definitely less satisfying than the previous titles    it is well above average for an rpg game but not nearly as good as bg1 or soa and i rarely replay it    worth it for watchers keep though that is a great dungeon i clear it as part of soa before the endgame
i really didnt like it what i enjoyed about baldurs gate 1 and 2 was its open world and nonlinearity although they were combatheavy games there was a lot of exploring to do as well theres no exploring in throne of bhaal and it goes from one boring high level battle to the next i just found it so boring and bad
  baldurs gate 1 and 2 are combat heavy but the approach to encounters is extremely open ended being in combat doesnt change much and allows you to find creative solutions or just cast invisibility 10 and skip encounters you dont like    tob is full of unskippable gotcha fights that are fun for a bit then get real old
  as an example a huge number of encounters in tob involve your party automatically moving up into a group during a ingame cutscene a bad guy talking to you then gotcha enemies spawning in    in the real bg games you can approach almost every boss battle by murdering them instantly out of stealth before a dialogue prompt even comes up if you built your party that way
high level dd falls apart quickly especially if youre one of those poor souls like me who doesnt enjoy playing a full caster for whatever reason    i didnt think the antagonist was very compelling theyre even more boring than irenicus imho and it largely just feels like one massive dungeon crawl through samey environments when at least soa and sod have more variety in that department even though sod is admittedly super linear
i dont like how theres throngs of mooks with full 3 gear
  each time i see one of these i purchase and gift a copy  ill take one

misunderstood masterpiece or charming failure
  a charming misunderstanding but seriously i was into pc gaming back then and i enjoyed that one more than vii or vi
how about its just a failure it feels like even less of a jrpg than xenogears which is an impressive achievement
  masterpiece
i had a grand ol time when i first played it my first final fantasy and my favorite
its pretty good  best ost in the series  fun to break
  great graphics great music trashy nochallenge noconflict gameplay and a pathetic failure of a script
you have to pay attention to the details to get a good idea of the story    so you can imagine how people think the game is shit
  its not like the details make for an interesting whole you just get to learn about obnoxious shit like moombas you wouldnt like a scavenger hunt either if you were told to search for turds
  a game for autists that cant shut the fuck up about it every week on /vr/ without realizing that more people are going to resent it like other entries in the series like ffvi which got shoved in everyones faces for a long time and people got sick of it
  t brainlet    bet you think its stupid too how squall and everyone was in the same orphanage too
  ff9 is the misunderstood masterpiece it went back to medieval fantasy instead of the gay ass futuristic bullshit theyve been doing
i stopped playing at the part where they realize they were all orphans the story was just so fucking retarded i couldnt go on    also the game was just too damn easy stock up on magic and equip them dont use them on characters to buff them up then when you fight keep cancelling the menu until you get a limit break that already breaks the game but if you want to break it more use a limit break with zell or whatever the fuck his name is and do left  right then down  up over and over and over every single boss goes down easily    so the story was too retarded for me and the gameplay was also retarded trust me i wanted to like the game
  masterpiece of what it does mechanics plot and pace horrendously bad its pretty ill give you that    ff9 is the misunderstood masterpiece  masterpiece of waiting endlessly for my atb to fill    ff was pristine only from 5 through 7 just stop overrating the most mediocre titles
  lets not ignore 1 and 3 here both are excellent games
  
  its hard to talk about this game one way or the other without steppung on someones toes and starting up an argument so rather than do that ill just say that i liked it    i watch anime so the plot didnt bother me i like being able to do crazy builds so the gameplay was right up my alley further to that point i also like games that let you make shit so refinement was my jam i also really liked the cast and it has the best music in the genre  and dont even get me started on triple triad    its clearly not for everyone but thats ok too i dont like personalityless mass appeal games i like games that win me over with how one of a kind they are if you happen to like more standard games then good i hope you enjoy them    but for me even 20 years later almost i still play ffviii and its still a hotbed topic online while games that came out last year mean nothing to me and a lot of other people as well that alone makes fviii a special game in my book
i love ffviii its also completely broken by junctioning
viii is the best video game ever made
  accurate description  /thread
  mechanics are great and the pacing is a breath of fresh air compared to many other games what a retarded npc response lol jesus christ
most anticipated squeal that had to be so bold and ambitious that it was destined to fail to live up to the expectations of fans    i appreciate that square was really trying to make the most cinematic game of grand proportions but they just got lost in the weeds a bit trying to wrap what was at its core a war film with an overarching theme of the power of love transcending time and space literally another victim of japanese overblown unsubtle melodrama
  most final fantasy games have a problem with magic being really weak compared to auto attack and ff8 is by far the worst because it as you say additionally has a reason not to use it
  charming failure     side quests were interesting
  mechanics are great  great to break the game by junctioning 100 tornados by the time you reach the game nullify roleplaying and reduce tactics to press x to attack  pacing is a breath of fresh air compared to many other games  it is something new alright we went from tightly paced games to this boring slog with endless dialogue about teenage love drama    you know what is a npc thing to do worshipping nostalgia i loved mgs back in the time but now i cant see it the same way after playing much better actionstealth titles i dont let myself to get blinded by first experiences    you ff8 fags are always the same this thing is good because its good devoid tautology you cant never justify the value behind things tell me again whos the npc
  you reach the game  meant dollet
  once you release your work its no longer yours  it belongs to the consumers now  and the game is better if rinoa is ultimecia so ill keep believing it
  misunderstood    goat card game  semi goat battle system    materia is actually the goat battle system
  medieval fantasy is fucking boring the magitek ff is infinitely more unique and interesting
  based     squall getting lost in a time vortex and wanders around until he collapses sees a white light and his lover reaching out to him   no he doesnt die its just the power of love lol   squall not being seen from the others pov during credits but only rinoas doesnt have a bigger meaning than supplies   ultimecia waiting at the spot where rinoa and squall promised to meet means nothing   ultimecia using the griever gf which is squalls symbol that rinoa wants as a reminder means nothing   rinoa going on and on about wanting to stop time means nothing    ultimecia is just an asspull    yeah sorry kitase but im gonna take over the story writing of this game
  it really was a mistake for them to outright deny the theory it fixes most of the glaring problems with the story and makes the game better in every way
  you cant hate this game with such ost
   grind for hours to strengthen characters   lol game so easily broken  no shit tell us something else thats new
  my favorite ff game by far  drawing magic was tedious though  otherwise fantastic game
  whenever somebody complains about the system you assume they dont know how to play and that they must be drawing until the end when somebody complains and knows his stuff you still throw a fit because now suddenly the player isnt supposed to find a optimal way to play    so which one is it also it doesnt take hours you dishonest dumbfuck in 1530 minutes fighting fastitocalons you can unlock card mod easily
  he doesnt find cyberpunk dystopia to be the /comfiest/ of settings  m8
  magic is pretty overpowered in ffvi other than that its situational very strong at some parta of the game but mostly outclassed by melee at later stages
      i still think rinoaultimecia must have been an intended part of the story at some point in development theres just too much that points to it and too many loose ends tied up with it for it to be a coincidence
  underrated and thats fine with me let crybabies cry that junctioning is too hard it makes me feel smarter for something i figured out to get the best use out of on the first palythrough with no guides or anything
              it fixes most of the glaring problems with the story and makes the game better in every way    fixing the story by making it pointless since you achieve nothing riona isnt saved and squall gains nothing from his character development making the whole story meaningless    you fantheorists are the worst
  the canon final act of ffviii is such pointless dogshit that yes i do believe a gloomy ending with the cycle just repeating itself is an improvement
  your very limited idea of what a narrative must conform to is the worst enjoy being a pleb
  it was my first final fantasy i really cant slag on it
a favorite of the autistic
both and neither
  stories are only meaningfull if the mc wins something at the end    man youd hate asian lit
  its really equal parts steampunk to medieval fantasy and also done at a time when steampunk was still interesting and not done to death
  fixing the story by making it pointless since you achieve nothing riona isnt saved and squall gains nothing from his character development making the whole story meaningless  not all endings have to end with someone being saved or someone gaining something ru would have been a great twist and i still choose to interpret the story that way as  does    ru lets you reexamine much of the game and it ties into the games themes nicely it can even be a meaningful example of how gfs cause memory loss as rinoa as ultimecia fails to recognize squall for who he is shes forgotten everything and now all she cares about is compressing time for a reason she cant remember and destroying seed
  i think theories like this is simply proof that 8s story is so messy and baffling that the fans will grasp at anything to try to form to sense of it
my biggest disappointment with ff8s story was probably disc 4/the end of the game it just felt anticlimactic when you go into the future and immediately step into ultimecias castle i was hoping wed get to go to a full on dystopian future with a big ultimecia city and everything and actual shit to do before you go and take her castle it could have been some cool extra worldbuilding
good things  one of the best ff soundtracks  gorgeous fmvs for the time  great setpieces deling city mission garden vs garden  one of the best minigames in any ff triple triad    bad things  story is absolute nonsense after the 2nd act  junction system is completely broken  game is just way too easy overall  every character that isnt squall or rinoa is terrible
  your mistake was expecting anything    ff8 consistently hints at a much bigger richer world and consistently underdelivers and disappoints
  hating based laguna
good soundtrack but has a retarded story and uninteresting characters aside from laguna and irvine
  i was massively disappointed with this when it came out i had to force myself to finish the 4th disc i never bought a ff game again after it i played but never finished ix or x and decided never again
    it feels like even more of a jrpg than xenogears which is an impressive achievement because xenogears wasnt a jrpg it was a very shitty anime    ftfy
  why didnt laguna ever go back to julia why didnt any of the soldiers come looking for him since kiros said he was awol  why did he all of a sudden shack up with a single mom  why would ellone even know about her stepbrother squall    nah laguna was a deadbeat dad who couldnt have been more faggier with the long hair
  why would ellone even know about her stepbrother squall    so this is the canon timeline of shit that happens after laguna gets married to raine i think    raine gets pregnant  ellone gets captured by esthar since adel is looking for her  laguna goes to esthar to search for ellone ends up doing shit like acting in movies along the way because why not  raine gives birth dies either in childbirth or shortly afterwards  squall is sent to edeas orphanage with other war orphans rest of the playable cast minus rinoa  laguna helps overthrow adel becomes president of esthar gets ellone back  ellone gets sent to live in the same orphanage as squall because   laguna never bothers to come back for ellone and squall because     if anyone can fill in the s feel free laguna is either the worlds shittiest father the story doesnt make sense or both
  you missed out on a great game on ffxii
its a character story with a number of poor or underutilized characters and mechanics that are love or hate but easily broken over your knee regardless    i think it has some of the greatest world building in the franchise but its almost wasted for all of the issues i have with the game i do love it and ill defend squall as having an interesting compelling character arc despite being chained to rinoa seifer is another great character whos sadly underutilized but theres a hint of something fantastic in his and squalls interactions    its a deeply flawed game and i dont blame anyone for disliking it but i personally really love it
  its been a minute but laguna either never knew about raine being pregnant or never had the opportunity to leave both of which are feasible due to the world being fairly dangerous and longdistance communication being extremely difficult    the movie gig was because he needed money for the trip which to me implies he was searching for way longer than he thought hed be
  its been a minute but laguna either never knew about raine being pregnant or never had the opportunity to leave both of which are feasible due to the world being fairly dangerous and longdistance communication being extremely difficult    which makes it all the more insane that ellone gets sent away to the same orphanage especially after laguna went to all that trouble and literally staged a coup and overthrew a countrys government to save her
  oh yeah the orphanage thing is nonsense and doesnt seem to serve any real purpose in the greater story the only way i could excuse it is by having that be irvines reason for not wanting to shoot edea
what is the reality of disc deterioration    daytona usa cce the game i bought with my sega saturn way back in 1997 i think cant even remember anymore still boots up just fine that is literally the oldest discbased game i own so what exactly is the concern
i have laserdiscs from the 70s that still work flawlessly disc rot is a manufacturing error nothing more nothing less
its mostly just to fearmonger the pressure of dumping what hasnt been dumped/cataloged which is mostly pc games otherwise no one really cares what stupid games start rotting
  well i care if my collection of games stopped working
  i have my a momentary lapse of reason cd from 1987 and it still works fine its been in the basement for years various summers spent in a glovebox generally nonideal environments and still plays and doesnt look like your image as long as the paint doesnt come off i could care less if my collection rots i dont have anything super valuable so i could just get the roms whenever while still having the original jewel cases for my /shelf/
john hancock says disc rot is real and he knows more than all the 14 year old meme spouters on this board combined     
  some games of mine are fine yet some are fucking melting away
expecting everything to last forever  imagine being this retarded even if your disc rots it is way better than buying digital    youtube trash  kill yourself underage faggot
  i can smell you through the screen you reselling fat fuck
  only cd i have with disc rot is a burned one and even out of all the burned discs i ever had just that oneand i have a bunch of failed burns that i just have laying around and theyre still clean    also i live in florida where humidity is rampant so i think the whole disc rot thing is mostly a meme or the real cause of it isnt yet known and everyone is just losing heir shit over basically nothing
  when you start smelling things through the screen in your moms basement its time to listen to mommy and come up stairs and take a shower
  isnt yet known  advanced termites
  thats not disc rot its a manufacturing error
anyone else notice how most people generally agreed that the adventure games were good until game grumps and projared made their videos on them so now literally everyone just repeats those videos wordforword instead of just having their own opinions
  the adventure games sucked and so did the dreamcast
  no people agreed they were neat and alright up until the battle/dx ports reviews and old forum posts agreed the games werent quite what theyd been hyped up to be well before ecelebs came into the picture    modern day shitters have only played watched most likely the increasingly shitty ports of these games dc versions are very playable and dont have half the goofy ass glitches the gc ones have nevermind the ones that came later    all in all sa is solid and sa2 sucks for lack of a budget if sega hadnt been dying at the time it wouldve been much closer to sa only with geniune improvements instead we got a rushed hail mary of a game thats far less ambitious and interesting than its predecessor
  having their own opinions means no friends and can be offensive having the same opinion as a bunch of other people means friends and belonging into a certain group  so yeah sonic became a joke due to that even classic sonic because thats cool
  more like defending sonic and consequently furry community is fucking autistic and nobody wants to associate with that
  dc versions are very playable and dont have half the goofy ass glitches the gc ones have nevermind the ones that came later  this
  dcs western versions the original japanese sa1 release had bugs and glitches problems      every fanbase have their autistic part
no people have been saying 3d/modern sonic were all bad for a very long time there are yahtzee videos from over 10 years ago where he openly says this and those people are correct sonic adventures isnt good its completely stupid in terms of gameplay premise and execution i think more people should acknowledge this game series isnt amazing and move on i dont care if it really is a more generally accepted opinion now the game should stand by itself and it does not
  well i mean its only natural that a game brought back into the spotlight is going to be reevaluated certainly those of us that played these games as children arent going to have the same opinions now i think they feel dated i still enjoy them but its hard to call them great games     i think there are a lot of teenagers that fall into the trap of tribalism when they watch these ecelebs but thats been true as long as mass marketed media has existed and with sports longer    absolutely though the modern hd versions of adventure 1 are an absolute mess they need to rebuild the game from the western dreamcast original instead of making a three times removed version of the already bad dx
  furries and animefags are all autistic with none of the good parts only pedophiles have an interest in sonic past age 11
  attack of the influencers     name a game where you go fast run up walls and loops and make big jumps that is better than sonic adventure 2s sonic and shadow levels protip you cant     sonic adventure and sonic adventure 2 are not bad games the lowest score id give them would be a 3/5 the major problem is how inconsistent the quality of levels / missions can get these games complement the 3d mario games perfectly
  anyone else notice how most people generally think that most people are most people who watch mostly the same people  i have noticed its amazing how those most people are completely ignorant of the fact that most people arent actually the tween twitch demographic
maybe the majority is right and its you losers who are wrong ever thought about that if everyone else seems to agree the problem is most likely you
  im 18 and i played it on a dreamcast totally unbiased and hated it its not fun it controls like shit the music is bad the tone is cringe inducing etc etc the only reasons i can see to explain why someone could like it is    1 nostalgia  2 contrarianism  3 sonic autism    its a very mediocre game
  the music is bad    opinion discarded
  i mean i wasnt really asking for your approval sonic cd is the model of what sonic music should be
  buttrock
  anyone else notice how most people generally agreed that the adventure games were good until game grumps and projared  game grumps and projared  fucking who  sonic adventure sucks it always has  sonic cd was the last good sonic game
  based zoomer
  the only reason i could see why people dislike sonic adventure are    1 parroting  2 contrarianism  3 hereditary autism    the game is just fine no one cares about your favorite youtubers opinions
  look at the steam scores both sa 1 and 2 score 8590 right now on steam only idiots pretended the games were bad     iirc the only people that disliked the games were when sega ported them for psn/xbla and they didnt flesh them out proper they had some issues that took too long to fix and the pc versions came fixed
  i dont watch youtubers but nice ad hominem i thought older people knew how to conduct debates without resorting to cheap blows
  the game is simply not fun its the total antithesis of the classic sonic formula
  the game is simply not fun its the total antithesis of the classic sonic formula  what youre saying is its not fun to people circlejerking the mega drive sonic games or people simply incapable of liking more than one thing    super mario kart is the total antithesis of the classic mario formula therefor its trash am i right if sonic adventure were its own thing unrelated to the sonic brand would you then see it as the solid c tier game it is
  its just not fun period rayman m was a good gotta go fast platformer that doesnt randomly kills you because the engine failed to play a scripted sequence jump properly
  no youre strawmanning now i never fucking said that are you crazy or something its not fun because there is absolutely nothing about the game design thats fun whatsoever its a twitchy awkward grating ugly glitchy mess of a game that holds absolutely no value outside the lens of historical context
no all 3d sonic titles started getting bashed both preemptively and retroactively with the release of sonic 06 and rightly so      that faggy video by red letter media certainly deserves credit for shitting on 2d sonic though
it was never good anyone who played mario 64 or another great 3d game knows how bad sonic is
  i played gex enter the gecko and like 10 minutes of tomb raider 1 then i played sonic adventure game was a fucking marvel
  i know 5 underage dorks  3 agree with me  that makes me right  lol
theres no eceleb we nintendo fans have been saying sonic sucked ass for decades
  if everyone thinks youre a moron maybe
  you ever see a sonic fan theyre rabbid assholes if anything people were afraid to say anything bad about them until they did    we all knew they sucked
  yea because those are terrible games
there has unironically never been a good sonic game
    too bad sonic/shadow levels are only 2/5ths of the game and still are hit and miss     and to answer your pondery every 3d sonic game after save for 06
  fzero gx fills that criteria irony here is that sega published it
  sonic cd fucking sucks its like a shitty rom hack of the first game with the most convoluted and autistic level design the only good thing it has going for it is the soundtrack
theres supposed to be a map but the controller only has one button how do i play this game
  read the manual you dumb kid
     a move color/blackandwhite switch to call up galactic chart see illustration next page    well fuck me    
  see that wasnt so hard was it
    no but it was awfully sanctimonious
  reading the manual should be the obvious answer if you cant figure a game out especially if the game is so old it cant provide ingame instructions
starmaster is pretty great  i get the urge to play it again from time to time
  ok how are you going to call up your galactic map on that thing
  if thats activision anthology the various console switches were flicked by holding l and pressing a specific direction on the d pad
    activision really knew how to play within the limitations of the atari the physics and movement take precedence over the graphics which matters a lot more here
    its kinda mandatory for atari 2600 games that arent totally straightforward shooters are something yars revenge is the true pleb filter fantastic and simple game but not selfexplanatory in the least
  so i found a local game/record/movie store recently and everything is overpriced except the video games for some reason i think i got yars revenge for 2 i know thats not a bargain but the same store had vhs tapes for 6 and once something costs 12 the price is sort of irrelevant    id never played yars revenge before either but i didnt have any trouble working out how to play that one
  turn the difficulty up the rules change
    hmm interesting a zorlon cannon is really annoying to fire mode
recently started playing snatcher but oh boy is the ui full on cancer love the world and the story but i dont have it in me to check every possible option in the shit ass ui only to find out you have to pick something twice to progress so does policenauts pull the same shit or is it actually playable
sounds like you just dont like adventure games
  cancer  good and bad news anon youre too much of a faggot to play this game so you can stop
have you never played this kind of game before
i dont like exploring everything in an adventure game    you know thats the equivalent of saying i dont like shooting in an fps nothing to do with the ui its all about you
babbys first point and click experience everyone point and laugh at the newfag
  i dont recall maniac mansion or indiana jones requiring you to ask the same damn quesion twice to proceed
  then play with a guide you fucking casual thread over
  inherently bad game design  annoying main character asks hot bitches the same question 3 times  der der ur just bad git gud
  bad game design its barely even a fucking game its just a book with weird controls
  every single japanese detective game is like that dont play them with a lucas/sierra mindset theyre not the same thing both genres spawned from classic text adventures
      i remember curse of monkey island did require you to ask same thing over and over to get that one guy to teach you the insultdueling and nothing indicated you have to do that because he gave same repeated answer until suddenly he gave in    kings quest series had it at several points too    that shit happened because there was a paid hint line you could call for a solution so many games inserted some shit like that to get you to call them for money    luckily after the games been out for a while some gaming magazines published those knowntobetroublesome hints in special sections
     you need to read the graffiti on the toilet wall over and over in leisure suit larry until you find out a special password to get access to a prostitute ken sent me      this is one of the most famous puzzles in the genre
betrayal
  gay gay sissy gay
fuck off spoony you suck
whats a paladin
  your knowledge of the land shall be great
it all makes me really sad
  im not entirely sure
  i miss him man in fact i miss pre 2012 internet
  it was fun while drunk       if its in the gameits in the game
  me too bro but dude has legit mental issues and he was bound to flame out eventually
i will forever be grateful he introduced me to ultima underworld    rip spoony
  didnt he bash the game though or was that the sequel
  this was the only ultima that i did not buy initially when it was first in the stores even back then i knew it was garbage    someone needs to build a time machine go back in time and convince lord british to not sell origin to ea
  that triplechin
  the sequel for the first game he repeated the sentiment that you arent a true gamer unless you beat it
speaking of spoony i quite liked his counter monkey channel as somebody who knew fuck all about tabletop and dnd at the time his videos were pretty entertaining    are there any cool channels like that
  not a video channel but /tg/s wiki 1d4chan is a great depository for such stories i recommend you start by searching the classics of old man henderson and los tiburon
gothic is way better but ultima 9 is still pretty cool boo fucking hoo some internet man doesnt like it
  to be fair that review was pretty much spoonys magnum opus he reviewed all the games before it just to establish context and his own love of the series
  still go back and rewatch that whole ultima series of his every once in a while honestly one of the most touching things ive seen on youtube him talking about him and his brother playing it could tell that the dude had great love for those games and the memories he had of playing it    too bad all he does now is look greasy and do boring ass streams
  that and he has the single worst case of trump derangement syndrome ive ever seen
  rent free
  indeed
i cant believe people still support his patreon
  same here anon same here
whats up with spoony do we have any proper information that isnt just internet gossip and speculation is there a proper reason as to why he doesnt do shit anymore is april ok with this is his brother ok with this
  probably just laziness cant blame him as there are retards giving him around 500 a month to do nothing but post on twitter  
  ultima 9  pretty cool    confirmed retard
  aj pickett on youtube is pretty good albeit sfw
  ive seen worse jelloapocalypse was practically crucified over his vote video    it got so bad he rushed out a video on ace attorney as a form of damage control
  i wonder how many of those actually remember that theyre pledged to him    its like with dsp or anita sure they have a pretty respectable sub count on yt but like only a small fraction of that count actually watches their content
  ive never heard of jelloapocalypse but i just watched his vote video  this kid seems like a massive crybaby faggot
  just tried to watch that  could only get hallway through the cringe from it was off the charts
  he mostly is known for videos on various games  cartoons    but yeah he is a crybaby  everyone who disagrees with me is a neo nazi  wwhy is everybody dogpiling on me    best part about it was how he was bragging about the yt algorithm to people shitting on him in the comments and then he proceeded to disable his comments and set the video to private    guy lost alot of subs
spoony is one of those deeply uncharismatic people that could only be entertaining with scripted content but then gave up on that when youtubes algorithm stopped paying well for it     jontron uploads a meh written video once a year now and still makes money likewise if spoony didnt upload 2hr long wrestling vlogs hed probably still be semirelevant today
  betrayal  i thought this was from when he got super autistic about xcom
i like how lordkat is so bitter over that and he still blames spoony for him not making it big
  fuck man i wish hed put up the wrestling vlogs i never watch wrestling but listening to him made it seem entertaining enough but he hasnt done even that much in years
  it is but it became a running gag of his own and in the ultima 9 review he did this counter thing where he played that soundbit like 100 times      lordkat was good but just didnt have the charisma to ever carry himself into any noteworthy fame
    spoony is one of those deeply uncharismatic people that could only be entertaining with scripted content  lordkat was good but just didnt have the charisma to ever carry himself into any noteworthy fame  you guys pretty much described the bulk of the tgwtg/channel awesome crew    if any of those clowns had the talent to make it on their own they wouldnt have put up with doug  mikes bullshit for that long
  i feel sorry for his brother dudes a cop who literally put a bullet in some shitbags head and wasted him like a badass yet he has to deal with a degenerate and willfully abrasive prick for a brother   seriously spoony has no one to blame but himself for being such an unlikable and insufferable weirdo when hes had all the potential in the world   his profession has nothing to do with it he could step up put some money and discipline down and make high quality videos consistently i dont even hate his videos but hes just such a dildo and even all friends and family know this     theyre pretty shit in general though i think spoonys ok and actually has some verbal storytelling skill compared to most for the longest time they didnt even bother putting some money down on decent equipment even though they transitioned from regular jobs so presumably had a surplus for a while theyre not even that intelligent and dont provide anything interesting in terms of criticism dont bother to improve themselves and their skills even though this is their career probably because most of them are uneducated as in they refuse to actually read books and learn how to think deeply and critically
i bought this game when i was 11 why everyone hate it
  ever play the previous games besides being a buggy mess it basically shat all over ultima lore
    this is why weve been talking about spoony he reviewed all the ultima games just properly demonstrate what a fuckup 9 was once he got to it
  those werent reviews it was putting up a facade to portray certain games in a bad light
    gaming journalism is such a joke spoony did the right thing stating whatever his opinion was
  unironically the original version of the xcom fps looked more interesting than both the new strategy games  xcom declassified and if it wasnt called xcom nobody wouldve bitched
  one thing that ruined them for me was actually sitting down to play them and realize that spoony was pulling most of his complaints out of his ass and his ultima 6 serpent isle and uu2 reviews are just him not understanding what hes doing mostly    i might be biased because watching him play fallout 2 is one of the most painfully cringeinducing things on the internet      where did this guys oldschool player pedigree go in this one seriously
moon remix rpg adventure  fan translation project almost done testing phase    moon update 60/127 scripts done thought id get further but i actually got kind of occupied this week in any case thats about halfway there nowhere to go but up
  considering he was at 30 in october thats not bad
  hasnt this been almost done for years
reminder that lol eops
  yes
    stop pretending you can read moon
  translation was done afaik just not hacking it into the rom
  oh sweetie    are you gonna post some interview again
is this worth playing or is it too easy
play the capcom little mermaid game on nes
  is this worth playing or is it too easy  both
  is the genesis version not capcom mike implied it is
  published by  sega of america inc  developed by  bluesky software inc
  never heard of bluesky how do they stack up against capcom
  give it a go for 5 minutes see if it hooks you
  nowhere close but they still made vectorman
  where is princesssevenleaf i bet it could tell you all about disney princess games
  serious is this post some type of strange marketing for that one series by avgn i remember seeing the episode under recommended yesterday around the time this thread was made
is it weird to fap to ariel
  she has surprisingly fantastic tits in this game
  nice i like the shading
  oh god i wanna bury my face in those    its a lowkey /vr meme to post a thread about a game as soon as some eceleb mentions it maybe start it with something like just found this at a yard sale what am i in for
i bought this because i found it really cheap in my region but be aware that it is nothing like aladdin or the lion king      this game predates all of that its pretty rudimentary
what christmas/holiday related /vr/ games will you be playing in this holiest of months
batman returns has always been the christmas game for me everything from the comfy winter setting to the orchestral music catches the mood perfectly
  is this better than the psx version
  nah stick with psx imo
donkey kong country 3 with the christmas code
i want to use one of these for retro emulation to be clear i want to use this hardware to exclusively play games pre2000 or 5th generation and below should i use the latest drivers or rollback to an older version for mame ive heard multithreading can be wonky with newer drivers experiences
  if new drivers break something then it is up to the other developers to fix their product rarely does the driver of a gpu cause an actual issue mostly it is the fucked coding of the emulator or program go newest    the only reason to keep dated firmware and drivers would be in a situation where they are custom like for 240p output or something
  ive never had any issues
youre right op this is totally the same as asking which ps2 model is best thanks for opening my eyes
  speaking of which which ps3 model is best for emulating ps1
  thank you for the helpful response unlike the other trolls in this thread
  can you use it with the mame emulator
  i think i can but there are different results depending on the mame emulator version and also the driver versions of the pc video card hardware i already tried a few dos roms on it they loaded up okay
  what is a dos rom are you attaching extra chips to your video card to help emulate pre 2000 videogames
  its a readonly file that contains information to be played on a disk operating system which i dont have so i have to emulate the os and yes the card helps do this to emulate pre 2000 vidyagames
      the only guy who uses the term dos rom is you anon stop forcing it as a meme weve already got enough dual orb shitposting on this board oh and while youre at it stop writing fantrans as well
  mame doesnt have hardware acceleration
  this pretty sure mame will use your cpu to render everything never had an issue using modern gtx cards with emulators only thing that sucks is the newer ones dont support analog video out so you cant use a crt without an active adapter which introduces lag
  i want  the byline of your degeneration
  wrong my dude for actual game emulation its all cpu based but mame has been using it for various rendering options for a while now most notably in vector games and crt filters where you can adjust phosphor bloom and other hlsl options when using d3d hardware acceleration makes it look much better especially on hd flat panels what version of mame are you running
  look here on using hlsl options  
is final fantasy vii still a good game in 2018
  i dont know check the other ff7 thread
  it was a bad game in 1997 so what do you think the answer is
  beat it like 10 years ago had an autistic rage when i found out that you can get barret and caith sith best weapons only on a certain point of the 2nd cd not to mention some missable materia and lots of enemy skill shit  tried to play it a couple months ago but gotta have a guide next to me so i would not lose all that crap again
fuck off
  sakaki tifa  interesting
  good games dont age
i just beat disc 1 for the first time after borrowing the game and ps1 years ago    im having a blast with the story and magic system only thing im finding annoying is the lack of an item to avoid random encounters when im trying to explore some dungeons that have a lot of doors and stairs
  eh depends if you like this type of game its great but i dont see kids or teens finding much value beyond maybe the music everything has just aged a lot graphics terrible controls slow battles etc i could be wrong but i love the game and find it hard to play anymore
  yes i played it for the first time a year ago going in completely blind and its a great game    i didnt like it because its popular but because it genuinely was a good game and fun to play as long as you dont get autistic about it i dont see why its a bad game
  enemy away materia dude
really peak squaresoft the culmination of their near perfect snes run before they started going downhill with ff8
  only if you played it back then and have nostalgia it aged poorly that first rush of 3d were hit the hardest and ff7 although a decent game cant overcome that shit tier look unless youre a nostalgia bro
  with new threat yes
  characters actually look pretty good in my opinion anyway while in battle its the outside battle gameplay that looks like shit
its a turnbased rpg so it was never good
it would be a 10x better game if midgar wasnt mashing o to get through flashback sequences  only to get another flashback after midgar
  i think it looks great other than the field models as you say usually they are very zoomed out but it does semifrequently zoom in on them
its a really good intro rpg moves along at a good pace is about 20 hours long unless youre a slouch battles and exploration are simple to grasp and theres ton of one off unique gameplay events throughout the game that breakup the standard explore new town/dungeon its good stuff
    yes its still good but because so many people like it its now trendy to say it sucks because otherwise the implication is their taste is pedestrian
    hurr my adhd demands everything moves at the pace of a crack addicted hummingbird durr
  i think the materia system is extremely fun and open ended and the collection aspect inherent to that and the summons make it a fun world to explore its also still an interesting story with characters that arent just black and white and a narrative that broaches larger subjects that are interesting to think about    its also a little janky looks kind of terrible and has some really stiff dialogue in the translation so its not perfect but id still absolutely agree that its worth playing today
  i dont know check the other ff7 thread  lol seriously this spam shit has to stop man wtf how fucking pedantic can you faggots be op
ive probably tried to enjoy final fantasy vii more than any other game but just have never been able to its not bad objectively but subjectively i just cant make myself like it i dont know know  i get maybe four hours in and just begin feeling like i couldnt care less about anything going on i dont want to mess with menus or the characters anymore i dont like the weird deviations from the normal game play i remember marching in a soldier costume or something but i dont like the regular game either despite really enjoying most jrpgs so i dont know     i feel like giving it one final honest try how should i play it what mindset should i go in with     or should i just play skies of arcadia legends for the fifth time
  yeah still one of my favorite games
  appreciate the dystopia
  neither do bad ones they just stay bad
  the opening hours are intetionally very bleak and myopic its setting up a larger narrative of restoring the world from large scale pollution and overminging honestly not even the materia and general character building really opens up till then its a really big shift in the game and i cant help but feel it was intentional     if you cant get into it thats fine too though its not for everyone
  yes
i just beat it for the first time back in september id say so
  its the best game ever made of course its still good this is like asking if bach is still a good composer in 2018 or if shakespeare is still a good playwright
  still the greatest game ever made in 2018
  play it like a revenge thriller to kill sephiroth while the planet is literally dying around you but the citizens dont care anymore
witness the history of continuity
  well judging from your spoiler you are a man of impeccable taste in rpgs and you have a lot of the same issues i had with ff7 when i tried to play it so i think the best mindset you can go into ff7 with is trying to appreciate what it did for the genre in terms of cinematography and storytelling ff7 is a slowpaced slog for a grand majority of the game especially early on some people say it picks up once you get out of midgar but in my opinion the game doesnt really take the reigns off of you until you hit disc 2 and even then it hits you with some scenarios that are total drags    skies of arcadia is my favorite rpg of all time but i missed out on ff7 so i tried playing it for the first time last year and it was super hard for me to get into unlike soa it places a lot of importance on story and spends a lot of time just feeding you dialogue you have to care about cloud sephiroth aeris and the plight of the planet otherwise youre going to be put off the fact that the game hits you so hard with script so early on isnt going to do much for the kind of people who want to feel engaged in the gameplay as opposed to the story i would play for a couple of hours every day and it felt like i spent maybe 10 minutes of that actually playing the game so it started to turn me off since youre not 12 youre probably not going to be totally enthralled by the plot or characters right off the bat and since everyone not living under a rock on mars knows the plot of this game you cant expect any pleasant surprises you have to find some kind of progression to latch on to whether thats learning spells limit breaks finding/mixing/matching materia whatever interests you    ultimately i powered through and really began to enjoy the game especially the atmosphere and music once i had cobbled together my favorite characters and materia setups it was really fun but it took a while to get there for sure
  game so good that it made ff into a household name and singlehandedly skyrocketed the ps1 into super success territory based on its ad campaign alone  once it actually did release it went well beyond its rediculous hype and no one had a single complaint about it for years   like not until social media shitter le retro types addopted the n64 as the greatest console ever and started anti ps1 memery  despite this ffvii is still talked about in a mostly positive light and is one of the major selling points of the ps1 classic edition or only  it stands among super mario bros wow and halo as one of the most popular games of all time  iit was a bad game then senpai    id say your opinion is worthless but you come off as such an ass pained fanboi that i dont feel like it would do any good to say so    all this shit i just posted is just there to piss you off btw
  you have to be a tween or a pretentious midwit to sincerely like it its the catcher in the rye of vidya
its hard to get into this one these days the only psx ff games i still enjoy today are tactics and origins
  as someone who only got into ff7 recently and ultimately ended up loving the game i still have to agree with people who shittalk it because the pacing is awful and the gameplay is nothing special    99 of the praise ff7 got back in the day was because of its cinematics and storytelling especially in the western market before 1997 to most western gamers a video game was mario nba jam or mortal kombat then ff7 hits and not only popularizes a new genre but a whole new level of presentation within that genre seeing things like sector 7 being destroyed nibelheim getting torched or aeris getting greased by sephiroth were things that most people hadnt experienced anything like in a video game let alone with fmv sequences as nice as ff7s were it made players feel like they were a part of a movie which was the entire marketing point in the west if you remember the fmvcentric commercial the fact that players were involved in a story of such complexity and morality was new and exciting they werent watching this story unfold they were playing it people had literally seen nothing like it before video games that value presentation and story over gameplay are commonplace nowadays but in 1997 that was pure novelty for americans the idea that a video game would spout dialogue at you and you would even care beyond just mashing a so you can get back to collecting rings and jumping on turtles was unheard of the fact that it launched on the ps1 which was working to redefine a largely nintendocentric game market only added to the notoriety ff7 was the fucking future        also true i have friends who love ff8 to death because every time they play it they are immediately transported back to 1999 when they were edgy tweens who wished that they could go to a school for assassins and have women trying to tear their pants off while they say whatever its impossible for them to be objective about it
  the pacing is pretty good    i played it a long time ago but when i did play it around 2000 or 2001 the graphics were already very oldfashioned so i enjoyed it entirely based on its amazing world building and fun narrative it is entirely a classic final fantasy int a way that 89 and 10 are not though those games are ok     i also think the graphics are generally great the prerendered backgrounds most of what you are looking at are the best of the playstation batch every single one is iconic the battle graphics are nice the monsters all are very creative only thing bad are the legomen which i legitimately get over in about 15 minutes when i replay this one    some people are just bitter haters
  i agree with you ff7and 8 blew me away as a kid precisely because of the great presentation music and so forth going back to play them now is painful because they just arent much fun at all from a gameplay perspective random encounter swirls click attack listen to the same snippet of music win listen to another snippet of music also tedious and endlessly repeating its mindless grind and i guess as i got older i just started looking for gameplay over everything elsethe only jrpg i can genuinely say i love from this era is vagrant story because it had an interesting battle system and a fairly fluid environment to travel through
  tfw cant get this to run on my psp  why live
  the pacing is pretty good  no way i will concede everything but this the way the game drowns you in dialogue and minigames from the start is absolutely awful midgar is great from a worldbuilding perspective but a horrid way to start a video game even once you finally get to the world map you get railroaded to kalm for a plot dump so massive they put a save point in the middle and then to junon which has so much dialogue and minigame focus its basically midgar jr it doesnt help that the other two areas you visit on the first continent the chocobo ranch and fort condor are essentially just introductions to continuous minigames that youre going to keep coming back to there is very little to give the player a sense of meaningful progression on the entire first continent and then it forcibly whisks you off to costa del sol leaving you feeling like you havent accomplished much of anything for yourself because you really havent    i agree with all of your points of praise i love the graphics even the blocky overworld models i think they have a certain charm and the prerendered backgrounds are still gorgeous and immersive but the gameplay is nothing special and for most of disc 1 is absolutely abysmally paced i appreciate what they were trying to do here but every time you get a taste of freedom and think the game is finally going to take off you end up back in a town where you get suffocated by dialogue fetch quests and minigames again
  are you maymaying
cloud  cid  barret  this is the objective best party
objectivity is dead in 2018 so game is now a vague term for an application of some sort and good means like
  i played it for the 1st time this year got burned out during disc 2 its a fairly long game and not much changes gameplay wise i didnt like it as much as 6 but i think i like it more than 4 ill finish it one day i think its still good if youre into this type of game i dont think my opinion would have been much different back when it was released
          so you dont like the game and thats ok it wasnt made for you there are people who do like it and thats ok too
  all you need is trine as a enemy skill
  the praise it got was from marketing and that poster admitted it  it wasnt a bad game though it had a great aesthetic probably the best in jrpg history
  not him but i played that mod last year and i liked it how they add a ton of stuff while doing a few useless and more useful changes it gives some additional replay value in my opinion
  it had a great aesthetic probably the best in jrpg history  i feel like there has to be something else that tops it but at the same time it is pretty great between the character designs prerendered backgrounds and music this game has a very distinct feel that definitely sucks you in plus in 1997 the steam/cyberpunk setting was actually pretty fresh and is probably part of the reason the game was so popular since it was much more accessible and appealing to your average western gamer than fullon sword  sorcery type fantasy
  8 is the best thing in the ff series though the decline started with x2
  it wasnt a good game the first time i played it in 2004 so no it was behind the times when it came out it was just babys first jrpg so everyone remembers it fondly but it was pretty basic bitch
  none of the points you made refute it as a bad game it was an early psx title so everyone got it and played it and they made sure of this by bombarding everything they could with ads for it just because something is popular doesnt make it good its just easily digestible by the masses
  i didnt read the green text bro lol     and i posted this just to piss you off btw
  steam version  mods  youre gonna have a good time
holy fuck this game was incredible you guys got any other srpg recommendations coming off a game this kino makes me want to play more
  ogre battle fire emblem and kartia are similar to vandal hearts in that each side takes turns brigandine is a good choice as well
  ive played every fe but ill try the other ones you mentioned
  
  kartia is a rather odd one you have shared mp in the form of sheets which is used to cast magic which can be customized summon phantoms and the phantoms work on a rock/paper/scissors compatibility system game is average but the soundtrack is some great shit    
whats so good about vandal hearts ive never played it
langrisser 2 very unique strategy rpg great graphics great music play on sega genesis    and if you want a challenge note that you only get a good ending for a character if they never die during a mission
people seem to really rag on vandal hearts 2 here but it was just so cool the world was dark people were horrible the whole game was just depressing i cant believe sony allowed them to bring it over because some seriously heinous shit happens in it and i cant think of anything even remotely comparable in any other playstation game
  got told off by my mum for playing this in front of my brother because of the blood spray when an enemy dies
  unironically try valkyrie profile covenant of the plume and just never use your edgy sacrifice super powers it ends up being really tight as hell as a tactical game
  duuuuude her ass    shining force tactics ogre front mission etc  ogre battle fft etc
  its just a srpg done extremely well
  if you want something really long and really hard play hoshigami it seems to be all but forgotten but was intense
  intensely boring that is  have to grind in dull boring towers for levels and gems to upgrade your magic coins or youll die against enemies who always have better equipment or coins than you  no classes like tactics ogre or ff tactics just a deity system that punishes you for changing by forcing you to grind some more
  ive played shining force 1 and im currently working on the sequel      will give these a shot
the arc the lad games are kino
dragon force and shining force 3 on saturn the former is pretty easy but ive still put a ridiculous  of hours into it because it just feels good its hard to explain but it is a very unique game that you have to try   sf3 adds a friendship system to the sf formula and removes the random battles and much of the wandering from sf2 its story is convoluted but good and it is long it is actually 3 games that share some characters and a story and greatlooking
  try vandal hearts 2    i remember saiyuki being similar in difficulty level not as hard as ff tactics    also vanguard bandits      you meant tactics ogre not ogre battle
  i dont mind easy games i found vandal hearts super easy but still loved it
  so i did but ogre battle is still great stuff
question for all of you are armored units in srpgs good i always avoid using them wherever possible because i hate their low movement but im curious what you guys think
  it is the ai is dumb as rocksbut the game design is really interesting     check out dragon force for saturn it actually works in emulators similar to ogre battlebut instead of a bunch of small mapsits one large map
front mission 3
  yep its extremely weird and experimental and doesnt always come out well but fuck did they pour a lot of heart into the game ogre battle 64 on the other hand perfected nearly everything they wanted to do
  emulating on a fucking phone
  android literally has a better ds emulator than the one on pc
monstania and energy breaker for snes
is it worth to buy a xbox guys  how does the xbox handle the snes ps1 and n64 emulation is it good or bad  ive seen some comments about people saying it is good and a few say it is bad so id like to know your experiences/opinions about it just to make sure to buy it or not
  what would be the advantage of getting this over a wii wii seems like it would be cheaper with more controller options
the same guy has been spamming 6th gen nonstop and complaining about the rules ill report every single post you make until mods have you range banned
  well it isnt cheaper here where i live also im not planning to buy a wii      but this is literally my first thread here in /vr/ anon also im asking about the xbox just for classic console emulation purposes
i would just get a one s/x and a dev account and run retrix on that or whatever its called
  its okay for emulation but it cant do 240p like the wii can it does 480i minimum
emulation is for plebs and xbox emulation is all based on 10 year old emulators its a great console without that shit
  better homebrew better n64 emulation better ps1 emulation quake 1 2 3 ports can still play online multiplayer through xlink kai lan built in harddrive that can be upgraded to a 2tb sata harddrive xbox games
  it does 480p 720p and 1080i through component and hdmi pound cables though
  if youre using a modern display then you might as well use something else for emulation like a wii u
  better n64 emulation  maybe for the homebrew side of things but the official virtual console n64 emulators on wii have yet to be topped by anything
make360retro
how good is coinops regrading emulation accuracy and compatibility i was thinking of getting a xbox for the purpose of playing old arcade games
  i use finalburn legends and even that arcade emulator is pretty good plays arcade games up until 1998ish flawlessly coinops seems to be better but i never managed to ftp it to my xbox due to my shitty laptop that kept fucking up the connection
i prefer it to the wii just because i prefer the controller and because i dont like that whole remote and infrared thing shit with the wii i know theres some work around but im too lazy and set in my ways to change it now the wiis official n64 emulator is vastly better than n64 emulation on xbox which is a joke but youre better off just getting a n64 because it will never be right anyway these days however i would also consider going on ebay and typing retropie especially as xboxes arent the most stable of machines and mine give me trouble
jrpg thread please post only the best /vr/ jrpgs and action jrpgs
    btw pictures unrelated
play chrono trigger
  as if anyone hasnt or would at least admit they havent
  i havent not a big fan of snes rpgs that arent in first person
  i havent ive been meaning to get to it but cant decide between the original one of the fan retranslations the ds version or the patched steam release with those high quality fmvs
gay elf potion quest 2
  snes rpgs that arent in first person  are there a lot of firstperson rpgs on the snes
  doom duke nukem
  doom is not an jrpg and duke nukem was never ported to the snes
  smt and uh
secret of mana  secret of evermore    seiken densetsu 3 is cool too
  eye of the beholder  arcana  wizardry 13  wizardry 5 6  smt1 2 if
  good    also final fantasy tactics vandal hearts saga frontier vagrant story valkyrie profile
dont say i never do anything for you negroids
  nice list but uh do you have a list for jrpgs
  so chrono trigger thread
  im playing lufia 2 again and its a great game the characters have great personalities
  what personalities
  most of those are made in japan just because they are not turn based it wont make them less of an jrpg
  why do you enjoy the taste of shit      does the steam version have all the content from the ds version if it does just go for that
  yume meikyuu kigurumi no daibouken
  yeah but hes asking if you have a list of actual good games
  he specifically said jrpg in his reply whether they are good games is up to him but they are still jrpg
  avoid the steam release it looks like this
  dungeon master is pretty cool
  those games are not considered jrpgs if i said legend of zelda was a jrpg id imagine 9/10 people would tell me im fucking wrong
what are some good psx jrpgs that are on a single disc
  grandia  legend of mana
  alright ill ask since ive really only played the old ffs and i need more old jrpgs what are must plays on this list
  grandia is on 2 discs iirc
is there any turn based combat rpg that involves skill not baiting but it seems to me that turn based combat does not rely on any form of skill strategy or preparation for that matter the only winning factor are stats and healing items theres only one way to play efficiently and it is to spam buff/heal on your melee dps and spam aoe spells with your castersstatus ailments are completely irrelevant since theyre a waste of turn against fodder you can instakill and bosses are immune to all of them and when you cant get past a fight it doesnt mean you have to take a different approach but simply that you have to spend the next four hours or so in random encounters until your party stats let you face the next level in an action rpg being stuck in a fight implies you need to keep going at it until you can read the enemys moves and counter accordingly in a turn based it just means the devs have decided to artificially expand the playtime of their game by forcing you to do the same thing over and over you basically pay with your lifetime to be allowed to progress  to support my claim id like to add that when i see positive feedback about x turn based games the emphasis is always on graphism music atmosphere characters dialogsstory but very rarely the combat system
  we call them tactics rpgs
  saga and etrian require quite a lot of preparation and strategy the latter is allegedly balanced in a way that makes you constantly feel something is missing from the party and ailments are extremely useful even against endgame bosses in fact bosses being immune to ailments is largely a final fantasy/dq thing    as for actual skill the mario  luigi rpgs dont have a concept of accuracy or evasion but rather timed hits low bar but still an example
  a turn based single player format would have trouble requiring skill it more or less relies on strategy for difficulty
  dq bosses tend to be vulnerable to status spells you just usually cant instakill them
  underrated arpg similar to zelda with awesome music and graphics    
    is this bait
  this is missing super ninja boy a unique jrpg with action elements in battle system
  and when you cant get past a fight it doesnt mean you have to take a different approach but simply that you have to spend the next four hours or so in random encounters until your party stats let you face the next level  no not really even if this seems miniscule going back into a fight with changes in equipment has helped me win that fight in the past without having to go back and grind more so different preparation makes the battle go very differently  that said the general strategy required within a fight usually still is spam your strongest attacks  heal if necessary  repeat more often than not it seems and even if an enemy has a weakness that mostly just means you use fire spells instead of ice spells or whatever
  final fantasy tactics  tactics ogre  front mission series  vandal hearts  kartia   hoshigami   ogre battle
  agreed  if youre playing a jrpg past the nes era and you need to grind then youre either doing something wrong or youre playing 7th saga
  snes is loaded with grinding hells what are you on about
  does the steam version have all the content from the ds version if it does just go for that  no its basically the psx version without the loading times ct is one of those games that doesnt have a definitive best version sadly
  see brave prove  cant find a proper download cue/bin format  fuck im gonna have to buy this shit arent i
  list of good jrpgs  2 or 3 games is harldy a list
ill take advantage of this thread i need feedback on a couple of things namely   what games would you put in gold/silver/bronze take into consideration popularity not quality   i want to add icons for games that are shorter/longer easier/harder than the average and games that lean more towards the gameplay or story side   i want to include a tldr with maybe 5 games for absolute newbies what would you recommend
  i mean im not one to discuss the rating system but smrpg being anything other than gold is really weird
  just play the original on an emulator that is how most people played it
  i tried to play crono trigger and quit at the part where you end up at that intersection between times or some shit and got magic for the first time because i realized the combat was going to remain stale as fuck for the whole game
  chrono trigger isnt about the combat though the combat is just a stage for cool anime shit to happen when you meet the badguys
  ff tacttics war of the lions
  is there any turn based combat rpg that involves skill   yes so long as you consider making effective tactical decisions a skill many turnbased games require you to plan and then adapt to changing conditions on the fly    a good number are either easy or allow for statgrinding but being able to outgrind an encounter doesnt mean that it wasnt designed to allow for effective decisionmaking     id like to add that when i see positive feedback about x turn based games the emphasis is always on graphism music atmosphere characters dialogsstory but very rarely the combat system  what games are you talking about
  there are many games with grind walls and in others you may grind to make a shit character or build you like work    most people grind to erase difficulty from the game but its not always the case some people even enjoy planning the grind ahead to make it the most effective they can like disgaea
  currently playing this starting to die a lot too thinking about skipping battles
i dont think i ever had this much fun in a retro jrpg in a while
  lookin good
  kinda underrated ive been playing it on and off since september and im having a lot of fun the party grid system seems pointless at first but you kinda adapt to it and adds its own layer of strategy  the story dungeons are indeed a lot more bare compared to 2 but the combat quality is pretty good and the story bits are decentish so im not being too hard on it i didnt reach the ancient cave yet but i feel its gonna be better than in 2
  its not too tough unless you really grinded like a motherfucker try to maximize your options instead minmax some party members with your current skills/gear and you should get through
  what game is that
  looks like saga frontier its good shit even if it feels incomplete
  its saga frontier sure it doesnt have the same polish as bofiv nor an incredibly written story but it does so well in gameplay    getting a spark and then a lv4 combo is the best feeling in the world with that game
    are rabites jewish
  maybe
    okay but if you even recommend lufia i at least mention that it should be played before ii even though ii is a prequel  i dont know if i could have gone back to i after playing through ii first
  the grid system is vital to the central game mechanic of sf for example if you dont support your front line with green types theyll have less hp and will have more ipexpensive green techniques curiously enough these bonuses only apply at the start of the battle and remain even if you move members to different rows so having an optimal formation at the start of a battle can mean everything
  yeah i figured it out once i got aima it feels like a bunch of annoyance while you still got less than four members after that it kinda clicks
  vandal hearts    i played vandal hearts for the first time in over a decade like a month ago and let me tell you something sir that game is a fucking okay i remember it being my big jam as a kid but in between the release of ps2 and recent days i sort of drifted away from it and that was a real crying shame of me because it was just plain g doubleo dee good    it was short but moved at an almost perfect pace the difficulty was almost perfectly balanced not too hard but far from easy enough to just walk through plenty of objectives and hazards on the maps beyond murder everything especially nice stages included fighting on exploding bridges or trains that detached cars as you went up it    man i kind of want to play it again
  comparing ys to zelda is a disservice its a true arpg not an action adventure game with very slight rpg mechanics    also the bump system is original as fuck and really intense
  i really like this list and the effort spent on it somehow i wish we can fill it with more rpg
    your image for persona 1 is from persona 2 tales of destinys image from eternia/destiny 2us and i feel like it really should specify that the md lunars need the cd its some impressive work overall but id to see it give people the wrong impression    also no saturn
  the original ffls are fucking great maybe its just nostalgia but i couldnt get into the ds remakes
    the first one borrowes a lot from the first dq games it has way less to it than the second one but i feel its a must play if you like dq and ff1 combat and dungeon exploration scarce resources combined with those dungeon layouts have you optimising turns to finish battles taking the least damage posible pretty old school simple but engaging gameplay a middle ground between nes and snes jrpg gameplay     the second one is all about the weapon skills the ip system gives the characters the best customization out of every jrpg i know like a mix of the materia and limitff8 ver systems but not broken like those two it also has pretty amazing dungeons with more and better puzzles than a zelda game     the combat in returns is just as good if not better than lufia 2 the dungeons being randomly generated felt like a huge stepdown but the game is still pretty good     i started playing a month ago because all the rs2 threads they are pretty great games now that i got to rs2 i actually miss mutants and monsters having fun tho    also i skipped rs1 i hear nothing but but things about it starting with the translation should i go back to it after beating rs2 is it really that bad
  bad
  also i skipped rs1 i hear nothing but but things about it starting with the translation should i go back to it after beating rs2 is it really that bad    youre basically better off playing minstrel song
  shining the holy ark  grade a patrician taste friend
dat atmostphere  dat battle theme      i have now found love
  rs1 is too rough for most people it would be better for you to just play minstrel song once youre done with the games before it    wait until you fight mkii/mkiii
  there is a saga track but i dont know which one where you can hear a periodic clap
  rs1 is a fun game to fuck around in for a while but actually trying to complete it is a nightmare
  you fags confuse me who the fuck plays a japan rpg for the combat all of it sucks and is at best serviceable    if you want good combat go play a game designed around good combat like vanquish fag
  not retro    jrpgs have the best combat of any retro game
  what about fighting games
    why are you posting rubbish we just need some idiot to post legend of dragoon now to complete the trifecta of mediocrity    that is even fucking worse
  balduts gate is retro and has infinitely better combat that any jrpg of the time but again its not a jrpg whose only focus is railroading you down a singular path if you dont enjoy the roller coaster get off the ride
  balduts gate is retro and has infinitely better combat that any jrpg of the time  oh yeah spamming fireball is so deep and challenging
  more than spamming a button
  i think theres a pretty big difference to o shit i got hit hard better press the fullheal button and o fuck my strongest warrior was charmed and fucking my entire party up a basilisk is about to end my game outright and if i dont cast a summon to help the situation right now while dispelling my charmed warrior im totally fucked
  what does railroading have to do with combat lmao
  baldurs gate  combat  hard  is this bait that shit is stupidly casual compared to icewind dale or wizardry 8 pausing the game constantly to issue commands effectively is no different than a jrpg with turnbased combat unless you want to handicap yourself by not pausing at all of course    theres no need to railroad a thread with a pointless argument just because you dont get the appeal of this subgenre
  original on emulator is alright ds is best steam is a no no
  terranigma i dont know why its not on the list after that play bahamut lagoon
  front mission
  dual orb 2
  sounds interesting will have to give it a go
  please dont tell me this as a pathetic and desperate attempt at going haha in jrpg thing is simple but in wrpg thing is not
  infinity on the gbc is pretty good there was someone a few months who posted a rom hack that at least made the game beatable the last part of the game being kind of rough
  and final fantasy tactics is infinitely better than baldurs gate bgs biggest problem is consistency many fights are extremely trivial and many follow the exact same pattern of jrpgs focusfire on one enemy at a time except without the gimmicks jrpgs tend to throw in to discourage that eg desperation ai for a last mob standing then youll have one fight be totally unexpected and go to hell in a few seconds probably for dumb rng reasons like being charmed at which point you just quit and reload your last save make a few a minor adjustments and then steamroll as usual    sure when baldurs gate shines it shines pretty brightly but jrpgs are more consistently decent and theres nothing in baldurs gate like say the zeromus fight from final fantasy iv
  one thing i will give baldurs gate is that it legit tries to do a decent 2d battlefield something very few jrpgs do bg doesnt have the spacial depth of a game like ff tactics and quickly devolves into melee range or arrow/spell range in a round or less most of the time but its still better than most jrpgs in that respect
  the composer is a musical savant his music is godlike     born in tokyo japan on july 5 1968 ito became interested in music at the age of four1 he began to learn to play the piano becoming interested in it after hearing piano music coming from a classroom he passed by daily with his mother he was also interested in electone music but was discouraged from learning it by a piano teacher3 by the time he began composing at the age of ten he had learned to play alto saxophone clarinet and piano and was interested in becoming a singer/songwriter1 when he was close to graduating from college he decided to pursue a career in composing music when he asked a professor for advice the professor recommended becoming a video game music composer given the recent success in japan of dragon quest iii during march 1990 after applying to several video game companies including hal laboratory ito began working at square
  i just read that final line and i was thinking while i love baldurs gate and i enjoy finally having the chance to kill saverok the fight itself isnt terribly exciting meanwhile you have something like ff6s final fight with the great music changing as you fight this mechanical abomination and ascend to the heavens to fight a god maybe the fighting itself is as generic as the rest of the game but it feels great and exciting to be there whereas in bg you just trash on a group of dudes
  where is deadly towers on that list hard as fuk but a very very satisfying game to beat
  that kinda explains why saga frontier had so many diverse genres and styles in its soundtrack while still somehow fits the game as a whole
  i would think sweet home should be at least bronze since it is well known among horror fans and weebs  phantasy star 4 and maybe 2 should be gold the only reason a jrpg fan would not have tried them would be that they havent looked at sega games yet  i am also wondering why saturn and tg16 are gone from the list now i know they have slim pickings in english but you have other japanonly games on there for other systems
    sweet home is sort of a meme people know it more through reputation and youtube than actually getting into it
  i am also wondering why saturn and tg16 are gone from the list now i know they have slim pickings in english but you have other japanonly games on there for other systems  post them
  yeah solid dramatic execution can make boss encounters much more satisfying its not that i dont enjoy being able to stealth a rogue into a room and open a fight with a quadruple backstab that takes out the dangerous spellcaster but it can be a bit anticlimactic and thats just one example of course ultimately dd was designed for a tabletop setting where you share the tension and excitement of each dice roll with a group of friends    kefka is a great final boss design but i must admit that i rarely find it challenging without deliberately crippling myself somehow ff6 just gives you so many powerful weapons and abilities relative to those bosses meanwhile at reasonably typical levels4555 the zeromus fight is legitimately exciting in exactly the way i like a final boss fight to be z has enough health that itll take at least 610 rounds to beat him with good execution which should be enough to see his big bang aoe attack at least 23 times which is quite capable of taking out your main healer on a lucky roll forcing you to change your strategy and decide how youre going to get back on your feet before the next big bang of course    i love picrelated also although theres a case where taking him out in a single round before he can get off any attacks is easily the best strategy if you can pull it off
  rtwp  good combat  the ie games would be considerably better if they had tb combat a la gold box dark sun or later on toee
  post what look at the previous version of the list then compare to the one i commented on
  rtwp is fine in baldurs gate it seems likely you have not actually played the game
  it seems to me that turn based combat does not rely on any form of skill strategy or preparation for that matter  and when you cant get past a fight it doesnt mean you have to take a different approach but simply that you have to spend the next four hours or so in random encounters until your party stats let you face the next level    so now getting your party members experienced isnt preparation
  predicting movements is a skill like theres a guard command for a reason but i most people would just take the hit     its kinda like playing a good card game the luck of the draw is only half of it you got to track whats been played and what youre discarding
  wow i realize my mistake now i saw the action rpg list which had tg16 and some saturn stuff on it and mistakenly remembered the regular rpg list as originally having them as well i was the wrong one just want to apologize for being weird sorry
that feeling of getting a fullparty combo the first time
  i played very little saga frontier years ago  i was always getting stuck and getting oneshot by some enemies  i played the guy that was turned into a superhero  i should give this game another chance
what games let you keep your experience points if you/your party ko/die  i played shining force recently and that i think i like that feature
  dragon quest mother/earthbound megaten pokemon metal max mario rpgs    really any dragon quest clone probably does it
  ok thanks
  frontiers whole shtick is about being a weird fusion of worlds that somehow coexist itokens talent at making literally any and all kinds of music only reinforces the atmosphere and charm of the game which is why you have anything from chamber music to prog rock and electronic music depending on the scenario and worlds youre in
  yeah spamming left click is way more involved
  what are your favorites then
  i grew up with 2 i am properly playing 1 just now yep i took that long hopefully ill finish this time
  the ending will give you feels i went straight to 2 right after and the title screen intro got me emotional in a manly way
  unless you want to play it at the fullest extent one scenario is usually enough to get a good impression of the game since theyre all seperate and have a beefy amount of play time each youre basically playing a 7in1 game than all of it directly interconnected to each other
  need a kusoge infographic dual orb and ancient magic are shit
  avoid hoshigami
i dont feel so good
  shit list from a zelda wankboy and hater of turnbased games
which jrpgs have the most expansive worlds to explore and traverse i know plenty let you globetrot but that doesnt necessarily mean the towns and dungeons have much meaningful or interesting content within them i suppose technically a game that relegates you to a single town busting with activity could have much more content to it than a game that lets you visit dozens of towns with nothing in them if that makes sense
  dragon quest iii feels like an adventure great world to explore interesting towns but since jrpgs are mostly not fetch quest heavy most npcs are just there for the comfy feel or advancing the quest/sidequest    the only town with a lot of activity that comes to mind is treno in ff9
  the boss intro was kino  emerges from rubble while slowly walking towards the party from the shadows  black x starts warping into the twilight zone  music starts  mfw
  the turnbased ones were just separated and compiled into a different list  its in this thread
  if you can get past the glacial pacing dragon quest vii had a hugeass world that you can unlock and literally expand each island has one town which is very much integral to the story while having a unique episode of its own youll have a big map by the second half of the game to explore in after finishing each if the island episodes
what are some jrpgs with lots of towns and lots of people to and feel alive and are not always gloomy and towards story kind of like earlier parts of final fantasy v i am thinking grandia but dont really know is grandia like that
goat
what are some good genesis/mega drive rpgs i was always a nintendo kid growing up but recently grabbed the collection on ps4 sword of vermillion is pretty good so far just beat the imposter king
  the whole game is amazing when you read all the dialog in tommy wiseaus voice
  obviously i dont need to hear about phantasy star or anything included in said collection
  psx  no grandia  kuso list
      wat gaem
  this board has been fellating saga more so than usual this past week maybe the thread general should come back
  or you can play the improved dqvii remake
  check out the special file names those posts have
  its a shame the combat system is so insufferably bland and ugly
        are you scatt dogpilled
  im a bit iffy about the remake personally and its hardly an improvement in some places they did remove a lot of the little things that made the towns and some dungeons more fun to interact with like puzzles and shit in exchange for faster pacing and a fast forward button which the latter is a good addition to thae game
  i mean im not one to discuss the rating system but smrpg being anything other than gold is really weird  ill see what i can do    i really like this list and the effort spent on it somehow i wish we can fill it with more rpg  yyou too anon    tales of destinys image from eternia/destiny 2us  i cannot find a good screenshot maybe someone wants to emulate the game and provide a good one png  also no saturn  im not experienced enough is up to contributions like yours
  im thinking of picking up romancing saga 2 while its on sale will i be missing parts of the story by not playing the first game
  all saga games are self contained and completely unrelated to each other
  thanks anon
im new to jrpgs i really want to like final fantasy since its arguably the biggest jrpg franchise but just i cant get into it what is the appeal of these games  it isnt like i didnt enjoy the other jrpgs i played i loved dragon quest iv and not retro shin megami tensei iv but final fantasy still bores me to tears for some reason
  too right it should be under saturn
  what is the appeal of these games  ff is an utterly casualized series devoid of any sense of identity ambition or charm outside of the first two games its something of a gateway to the genre but its not really a competent series outside one or two sporadic games it has been a cashcow that had to keep the money coming since over three decades by now so its as lukewarm and accessible as possible to make as much money as possible and the fact that its not what youd call an auteur series like dq or smt only makes it worse    its the usual case of popularity not meaning anything when it comes to quality even outside of what happen to be personal tastes ff is as insipid and mediocre as it gets and you shouldnt really care about people calling you a contrarian or shit like that for not liking it
have played and finish wild arms 2  decide to give wild arms a go  that fucking scene where ziek gets eaten by mother where it shows her giant jaws as she pounces for him and then the sound of her eating him    i was so fucking surprised it happened holy shit
im a moron and got the bad ending in suikoden 2 i dont have any extra save files to go back to either it hurts
anybody played mystic ark its apparently the sequel to 7th saga and it got a translation    its a fucking weird game right now im at a part where people make towns out of giant fruit and veggies then have to move on to new ones when they start to rot   the only bad thing i have to say about it is that it can get kind of confusing about what you need to do to progress sometimes other than that im enjoying it
  got the bad ending  is just a cut scene
  its not really a sequel to elnard/7nth saga if anything its actually a prequel but that series is so inconstent its hard to make any sense of a supposed continuity especially when games like brain lord are part of it  im at a part where people make towns out of giant fruit and veggies  ah youre still in the second world you have a long way to go it keeps getting better though the next world will probably be a bit slow in terms of pacing it becomes more of a detective/horror story in a way with a few long sections with no fighting and puzzles  it can get kind of confusing about what you need to do to progress sometimes  dont know about that the first world might have given you that impression since the cat wars were supposed to be confusing as a part of the story but i think the game is very straightforward outside of hunting for the items you need for the next worlds or arks its also completely linear and fairly simplistic    whos your mc remeer or felis
  which games did you try      ff is an utterly casualized series devoid of any sense of identity ambition or charm outside of the first two games  ff had a solid identity at least through ff7 thats when it started to shift not coincidentally nomuras first character designs
  i went with remeer  the confusing part for me was figuring out what i was supposed to do with the hearts at first i spent an hour wandering around before i realized they go into the figures then i got the baby bird heart and couldnt find where to put it until i looked it up   and i didnt realize you could take all the ally figures at first and they gain levels just by being in your inventory so i only had lux while i fought all the foxes havent really messed around with the other characters yet ive just been killing the shit out of everything with lux and his laser beams and his atomic attack
  ff had a solid identity at least through ff7  what is that supposed identity about  being generic high fantasy theres no consistency in the series in either ideas or game structure let alone mechanical focus ff is a series that tries to do a bit of everything without doing anything right    when people talk about identity they mean some common unifying trait or philosophy behind it which ff lacks completely  dragon quest is about a globetrotting adventure and simple down to earth stories sometimes with a bit of a twist but still down to earth stories toriyamas designs and sugiyamas music have been a constant presence  smt has always been about demons gods and humans classic dungeon crawling demon negotiations and kanekos unique visual style and ideas even the more exotic spinoffs like raidou still retain these basic elements that make the series stand out  saga games have their massive rulesets and casts minimalistic storytelling practical growth system implemented into roleplaying player freedom and experimental approach to game design in general and yet despite being a purely experimental series it still has a strong core identity and philosophy  bof has ryu nina and the dragons even the wildly controversial bof5 has all the key elements of the series    what exactly does ff have  chocobos and some recurring names like cid highwind or shiva  each game tries to superficially reinvent the wheel or fix an older one for no good reason only for the next game to forget everything entirely since it always ends up in the hands of a different director or general core team trying to ride popular trends or make the series even more simple and less gameplay focused theres no real idea of what the series stand for outside of visual spectacle even the nes trilogy has no unifying elements
  seems youre not the kind of guy who just checks everything like i do  in that case i understand where you come from  havent really messed around with the other characters yet  theyre all good outside of maybe kamiwoo hes the weaker link of the cast due to being a pure glass cannon with weak toolset and sinergies with the arks tokio seems weak at first but his speed and buffs still make him a solid cast member while miriene is a good party member at any point in the game meisia lux and reeshine are on a tier of their own though lux is a monster at low levels and only gets a bit more fair later on when the rest catches up reeshine in particular becomes absurdly strong once you unlock her charge and meisia is genocider tier once you unlock a late game ark i wont ruin the surprise though youll really like it  also check the arranged album for the ost its rad    
  theres no consistency in the series in either ideas or game structure let alone mechanical focus  apparently you havent actually played any of them because the gameplay mechanics are all very similar  dragon quest is about a globetrotting adventure  so is final fantasy except that theres usually something beyond just the world   world divided into safe spaces and dangerous spaces   safe spaces are typically towns and dangerous places are overworld maps and dungeon levels   dangerous spaces feature random enemy encounters and bosses   encounters are resolved with turnbased combat preffiv uses a phasebased system ffivffix uses is the atb system and ffx uses atb with the realtime element removed   as you progress through the game you find increasingly powerful items weapons armor and spells   theres a variant on a standard class system fighter white/black mage dragoon ninja etc in ffiv and ffvi each character has a class in ffiii and ffv you have the job system and ffvii has the materia system which works a lot like the job system    toriyamas designs and sugiyamas music have been a constant presence  the first 9 games are all unified by uematsu soundtracks and the first 6 by yoshitaka amanos artwork do you just not know anything about final fantasy    each game tries to superficially reinvent the wheel  well thats the thing they arent actually trying to reinvent the wheel you just seem to think they are for some bizarre reason they mix up the progression system and how abilities are allocated to characters but the abilities themselves and the general class themes dont change dramatically if youve played a final fantasy game you know the black magic you know the white magic you know what summoned monsters are going to do until ff10 you know jump throw steal you know potions phoenix downs ethers in most cases the stats will have predictable effects
  because the gameplay mechanics are all very similar  they arent they feel similar because the core design is so weak and bland you can try to mix it up however you like and you still end up with the same thing but with more or less time spent navigating your menus or grinding  they mix up the progression system  they dont the progression system is always the same exp based one sometimes with or without ap which is again the most basic system there is  so is final fantasy except that theres usually something beyond just the world  except that none of what you listed can be classified as being a solid identity when its the most incredibly basic set of characteristics any and all jrpg share even the atb model isnt unique to ff and even most of the very same games in the series dont use it  the first 9 games are all unified by uematsu soundtracks and the first 6 by yoshitaka amanos artwork  out of how many games fifteenactually seventeen entries in the mainline alone less than half of the series even has any graphical integrity or style which still matters little by itself  but the abilities themselves and the general class themes dont change dramatically  because theyre extremely basic generic and without anything but names if not just an animation to actually identify them  this is without considering how much the spellkit has changed since the nes games dia spells died instantly so did things like saber until ffii came along and actually cemented 90 of the spells the games are using up to now unfortunately with the same exact amount of depth of a nes game and again the same exact things you can find in tons of other games smt also has mostly the same exact three tier spell design  you know what summoned monsters are going to do  what do they do in ff or ffii  why are they an extra lifebar with a timer and mashing minigame in ffviii let alone the seven non retro mainlines or the spinoffs
  they arent they feel similar because the core design is so weak and bland  explain your criticism with at least some kind of logic or fuck off to the short bus with the rest of the retards  out of how many games fifteenactually seventeen   9 out of 9 are uematsu thats 100 for the /vr/ run which is the forum we are on in case you didnt notice 7/9 are amano character designs  what do they do in ff or ffii  yeah they hadnt been added yet earlier games were simpler details were added over time  why are they an extra lifebar with a timer and mashing minigame in ffviii  ffviii is admittedly an experimental game and the odd one out for the series along with maybe ffii  because theyre extremely basic generic and without anything but name  and were back to you being a drooling retard with no ability to talk about games
  it really depends whether you can stomach some of the mediocre stories in most games till arguably vi i found ffv the most fun of all of them when i realized how fun it was to explore the expanded job system and suddenly i dont even bother following the plot much anymore and experiment what each class can do part of the appeal in ff is always the jobs you can pick and play which sadly had been lost in the mainline after v although dimensions and bravely default kinda tried to revive them    though if you want a game that is the peak of the jobs system youd want to play the tactics games plus matsuno could at least throw in a decent plot to keep you going along with it
  explain your criticism with at least some kind of logic  theres really nothing to explain ff is at its core a basic ungabunga rpg with no mechanical finesse to it no matter how much you try to swap your toolsets around give them different multiplier values or fancy animations at its core theres really no difference between something like blitz omnislash and renzokuken theyre just big dick damage tools with simplistic calculation  the spellkit isnt any different it actually got worse as the series went on theres no mechanical difference between casting stone or death on an enemy the end result is the same but with different resistance values and stone not giving you exp in some entries ffii also had frog which was the same exact thing  theres no functional difference between the three tier spell system outside of power its just kit bloat that has no reason to exist at all because the designers are too lazy to make a stat system that actually matters and design a toolkit around it you can change how you get those tools or how much they cost all you want but at the end of the day they will still be the same exact generic thing at the end of the day which tons of other equally mediocre games use  thats 100 for the /vr/ run which is the forum we are on in case you didnt notice  you can move the goalposts all you like but it still wont matter and as ive said what little graphical consistence you have still wont matter especially when amano himself is a freelancer and so many games used his designs from front mission to rebus and its not like his ff designs are even unique  but i guess youre clinging on this specific point because i mentioned dq i can prove the opposite is also true metal max games had quite a few different main artists and yet they still retain the same general art direction style and ideas outside of the very last entry i guess  
  ffviii is admittedly an experimental game  it really isnt its just the result of the usual bad habit of shuffling around surface character build mechanics without changing the core system whether youre equipping materia espers or junctioning its still fundamentally the same slot system what little differences are there between this three systems are formalities at best and nuisances at worst  ffii did come up with something different on a core level though not as polished and well thought out as it needed to be to truly express its potential but that eventually grew into its own series anyway and if you ask me its the last true ff game but thats a rather uncommon opinion    call me a drooling retard all you want but the constant alienation of different generations of ff fans is all the proof you need about the series lacking an actual identity and strong direction behind it coupled with the eternal inbase bitching about whats supposedly good and what isnt precisely because the games lack a distinct unifying set of core elements to them which is also why they renamed the original gb saga games as ff games in the west for the record  you can put the ff name on something else maybe add a chocobo and some spell names and youll end up with a ff game however you cant do the same with other things if you tried to pass a ff game for a smt by doing the same putting a jack frost and some random deities name on monsters people will laugh at you
  ff is at its core a basic ungabunga rpg with no mechanical finesse to it  this is simply wrong particularly with regards to the atb system most other early 90s jrpgs feel clunky and awkward compared to final fantasy mechanics is where the snes final fantasy games shine really  theres no functional difference between the three tier spell system outside of power  of course there is you have power mana efficiency and accessibility which is related to progression that weve established you dont understand as being anything other than gaining exp so no surprise here in ffiv you also have cast time  the consequence is that in battle you can make a tactical decision about which strength spell to use its a simple granular but meaningful decision that fits easily in the mechanics already in the game and doesnt require anything pointlessly complicated like having to add an extra dialog window where the player must allocate a specific amount of mana to spend on a spell each time you cast it  in a game that doesnt have a full 2d or 3d battlefield having these kinds of decisions available is very important  too lazy to make a stat system that actually matters  the stat systems do matter even though the one in 6 is kind of broken just because you arent forced to pay attention to stats because the games are pretty easy doesnt mean its not there  you can move the goalposts all you like  im not moving the goalposts youre making absurdly bland generalizations and have nothing in the way of supporting arguments  if you want me to concede that postff10 final fantasy has no identity fine but that says absolutely nothing about ff1ff10 which does have a strong if gradually evolving identity
  most other early 90s jrpgs feel clunky and awkward compared to final fantasy  what in the world are you talking about  of course there is you have power mana efficiency and accessibility  none of these things matter at any point in the game since the games are far too easy for any of those things to matter and those toolkits are built to be used on a linear structure and you always have anything you need at any point in the gamesffiii/ffv are also literally entirely built around that despite giving you the illusion of the contrary with batches of classes being the designated hard counters or upgrades or the week  which is related to progression  progression is linear and scripted exp is a non issue dont even try to pretend otherwise  you can make a tactical decision about which strength spell to use  there no reason at any point of any games to use a lower tier spell once you get the higher ones outside of xiii where spells do actually work differently from the rest of the series  the stat systems do matter  they dont the only games where they matter are ff and ffii due to their respective natures of being hard locked with a well define party you choose and being forced to micromanage and build your characters manually in all the other games stats are a literal non issue whether because the game balance is utterly fucked like in ffvi/vii/viii or because the characters are hard locked into a certain archeype and growth you have little to no input over like iv or ix  the fact that those mechanics exist doesnt matter if theyre completely worthless    think whatever you want though you yourself said that ff somehow lost its identity from 7 onwardsdespite nomura being a main designer long before that and now you say that the problem is only from 10 onwards
  the constant alienation of different generations of ff fans  you seem to be taking /v/tier shitposting or serious arguments nitpicking details a bit too seriously i criticize ff9 a lot but still enjoy the whole series up to that point  the ancient nes games are only alienating in same way as any old rpg with crude primitive interfaces awkward pacing and/or too much grinding  most final fantasy fans like all of the snes and playstation games with maybe one exception the psx games gradually place more emphasis on storytelling and minigames over the traditional adventuring but it happens slowly anyone going to ff7 or ff9 from ff6 will feel right at home with all of the gameplay systems music and themes    i would say no real alienation took place until somewhere between ff10 and ff12 ff10 featured the biggest change in art style and themes thats when you really started to see nomuras influence while you can see the shift towards sex appeal with ff7 it wasnt until ff10 that you started getting offthewall stupid designs like beltdresses and vnecks to the crotch ff10 is also where the world is a corridor complaints started appearing for real and since then its just been off the rails with no consistency other than obscene production values    you can put the ff name on something else maybe add a chocobo and some spell names and youll end up with a ff game  maybe now but you couldnt 20 years ago
  you yourself said that ff somehow lost its identity from 7 onwards  but i didnt say that
  growth you have little to no input over like iv  you have a lot of control over stats in ffiv ffv and ffvii in ffv subabilities come with stat bonuses and penalties in ffvii they come from materia in ffiv they come from equipment
  im too fucking braindead to think of any reason at any point of any games to use a lower tier spell once you get the higher ones  you should never use a stronger version of the spell than is necessary it is quite common for a lowertier spell to be all you need doubly so if youre just trying to provoke a state change or reaction
  but you couldnt 20 years ago  you totally could 20 years ago much like you could 30 years ago square themselves did it in the first place with seiken densetsu and the old saga trilogy what more proof do you need  fft is the same its literally a watered down to clone with a few names and monsters from the mainline made by the people behind to on top of that ffmq is another example  the entire brand is little more than a label and it began to be so much earlier than youd think    you have a lot of control over stats in ffiv  can i have yang focus on int growth or porom focus on str dont think so  ffv  stats are completely irrelevant in ffv your job templates alter your characters hard stats and the games far too lenient for stats to even matter in the first place everyone can do everything with no real specialization and you have no actual control over stat growth itself  in ffvii  again they dont matter the games far too easy for them to matter and all the characters are functionally the same outside of their lb and some gimmick weapon which actually make some difference the stats in ffvii are completely negligible    you should never use a stronger version of the spell than is necessary  why wheres the supposed penalty for that spending one more turn using an ether from your item stock big deal ff has no resource management nor inherent enemy difficulty to warrant actual mp economy theres no reason to not use higher tier spells when theyre available the only game i can think of where spell tiers actually matter is tactics and even there it all crumbles when you get arithmeticians which bypass casting time completely and break the game even further
  i dont know much about other ff to have a say on them but you argument against 5 is completely off  stats are completely irrelevant in ffv  your job templates alter your characters hard stats  how does stats in ffv not matter like a character strengthagility and level alone effect your damage output depending on the weapon   games far too lenient for stats to even matter  classes with pros and cons and only one ability slot is too lenient  everyone can do everything with no real specialization  only if you grind every job to mastery sure you make everyone black mages but you now have shit in terms of physical damage and low healthits a better idea to spread everyone out to different class lines and make a balance party in any way you can  you have no actual control over stat growth itself  in a way yes you have no control over your stat growing like in smt throughout but their are ways to manipulate stats to a certain class like for example the berserker have shit magic and speed but if you give the the equip harp ability they gain the magic and speed of a bard while keeping the strength of berserker this method makes weapons like the gaia hammer more potent in terms of overall damage output to multiple of enemies
accidentally posted this in the ct thread  help me pick my next psx jrpg boys i just finished suikoden 2 and played lunar before it i think ive got it narrowed down to xenogears bof iv or grandia
  xenogears
  grandia definitely it carries on gamearts wonderful wholesome and fun adventure vibe that was present in the first 2 lunar games and is in very few other games except skies of arcadia because studios opted to mimick squares grimdark scenarios but never achieved their quality     xenogears is an unfinished mess shame because disc 1 is fantastic disc 2 is utter garbage and makes no sense
  like a character strengthagility and level alone effect your damage output depending on the weapon  youre completely missing the point  stats in ffv dont matter because of three reasons  1the game balance is as always fucked what little difference in stats there is between characters is unimportant a mystic knight lenna is hardly different from a mk bartz on a statistical viewpoint what little damage or hp difference there might be is irrelevant  2your innate character stats are pointless since changing jobs alters the stat sheet to fit a template anyway on top of that you can change those further with other ability slots  3changing jobs is essentially a soft optimized respec theres no commitment to character development nor is any real freedom you just swap between premade templates your mk bartz will always be the same exact mk bartz no matter how many times you play the game  classes with pros and cons  the job system in ffv only gives you pros theres no cons no maluses no inherent handicaps you cant just ignore by mixing and matching you have no real weakness at any moment in the game and the fact that theres no actual commitment to your choices means the game falls apart on a mechanical level which is why the only way for the game to be somewhat of a challenge is the fiesta runs where you randomize the class composition and you force yourself to stick to them as a self imposed handicap  only if you grind every job to mastery  whether you grind or not it doesnt matter youre missing the point again any character is good at anything effortlessly and will always be so in any scenario especially due to how lax the stat system is and the fact that again you have no control over it outside of swapping premade templates and a subset of toolkits and bonuses that are freely usable by anyone with no real limit other than having one slot per slot category  its a fundamentally flawed system
  akshully becoming a mage gives a significant damage boost to spells
  what little difference in stats there is between characters is unimportant   your innate character stats are pointless   if you knew how level threshold work theres certain times where someone like faris is better at being thief than the others or bartz being a knight etcthats why theres only 4 party members unlike iv and vi large cast  your mk bartz will always be the same exact mk bartz no matter how many times you play the game  maybe but i can take him through a different route next time  states cons of the black mage job  theres no con  thanks for ignoring my point  any character is good at anything effortlessly  tell me what would the whole point be if someone is way worse at one job than someone else where will be the benefit in that its videogames not reality  which is why the only way for the game to be somewhat of a challenge is the fiesta runs  ff5 is the right amount of difficulty not too hard and not too easy pretty comparable to ff4 jpi dont dont feel difficulty is that much of a problem for the game only balance of certain abilities  fundamentally flawed system  its fundamentally enjoyable one
    well i jumped into xenogears and i have to say boy is it hard to look at im sure ill transition and get used to it but man is it an eyesore coming from suikoden 2
  different poster but i find the baldurs gate games so much more fascinating after i tried out a tabletop rpg for the first time    its kind of amazing how well they replicated that feeling but at the same time it loses a bit without other people playing with you i wonder how the multiplayer is
  literally doesnt matter whether your black mage does a tiny bit more raw damage than your time mage which is further made more irrelevant by how damage is handled in general in ffv and how battles are designed if you want actual damage you go the spellswordrapid fire route you use a time mage with twin cast and meteor and whatever else because stats are irrelevant  if you knew how level threshold work  it doesnt matter how level threshold works whether galuf does a tiny bit more damage than bartz as a monk is irrelevant the statistical difference between the two is too small to ever be relevant its a fine idea in theory that doesnt work in practice for loads of reasons from a stat system that is horribly designed to the nature of the job system itself and the enemy design let alone the battle system  maybe but i can take him through a different route next time  which changes nothing at all even if you level him up as a black mage then switch him to a mk he will still be the same mk and even if you choose to make him a bm he will be the same bm lenna faris and the rest of the cast will be in another scenario  the characters themselves are irrelevant theyre just vehicles for your classes templates that do not alter the classes efficiency like theyre supposed to  tell me what would the whole point be if someone is way worse at one job than someone else  dont ask me youre the one saying that characters having different stats matters when it effectively doesnt now youre asking me why should those different stats actually matter  i dont know maybe because theyre different characters maybe because thats the entire point of having different unique stat sheets for the characters themselves  why even bother making them if you aint gonna use those stats thats exactly why im telling you that ffv uses a fundamentally flawed systems that actively goes against itself  ff5 is the right amount of difficulty  so none
  square themselves did it in the first place with seiken densetsu and the old saga trilogy  game boy spinoffs  obviously you werent alive when those games were released or youd know those games werent remotely considered real final fantasy games  the entire brand is little more than a label  no it isnt your argument boils down to final fantasy is easy therefore they have no identity that is an idiotic assertion kirby is easy therefore it has no identity warcraft is easy therefore it has no identity    can i have yang focus on int growth  no but its fascinating how retarded you have to be to stick the term growth on there as if that matters  can i have porom focus on str dont think so  yes you can she can wear karate gear and the headband which both give a substantial boost to strength in the vanilla game shes not in your party long enough for it to matter but if she stuck around it would this is easiest to see in the ff4 randomizer with str gear and a decent weapon like the power staff or a highend bow porom can do some damage  can i have rydia focus on str  yep heroine armor or black belt bandanna and fire whip this gives hefty bonuses to str which substantially boosts her melee ability while also heavily penalizing the effectiveness of her magic  can i have cecil focus on will  yes although by the end of the game his white magic abilities arent very useful and some of his good gear has will anyway earlier in the game you can certainly use cecil as a primarily defensive and support character putting him in the back row and using his cover ability  can i have cecil kain and cid focus on offense instead of defense  yes you can load them up with heavy armor or you can give them statboosting stuff to enhance their melee output you can also make that same decision with edge to some degree as he has a few choices such as strength ring vs samurai gauntlet
  spending one more turn using an ether from your item stock  yeah this actually can matter a lot turns are valuable in final fantasy games because battles tend to be rather short  big deal ff has no resource management nor inherent enemy difficulty to warrant actual mp economy  it does if you want it to its a jrpg you can grind more resources than you need if you want this does not mean resource use never matters and certainly does not mean the series has no identity   the only game i can think of where spell tiers actually matter is tactics  odd that you should say this as ff tactics is one game where the spell tiers really waste a lot of ability space that could have been used for more interesting abilities that made better use of the games unique mechanics in fft the second rank is often the best option and often you can get by with just bolt 2 which almost nothing resists and you can boost with equipment its rare to really get much use out of the rank 3 spells until you unlock math skill and the rank 4 utility is even rarer
  theyre just vehicles for your classes templates that do not alter the classes efficiency like theyre supposed to  like theyre supposed to  who decided thats what they were supposed to do you sure you can criticize this as unrealized potential you can say its casualized to not matter but you cant say it makes the class system meaningless and you cant say that stats dont matter you cant say a game lacks identity just because it isnt exactly what you think it should be i seriously feel like im explaining this to a kindergartner right now  why even bother making them if you aint gonna use those stats  most likely because they followed a solid game development process where the engine and mechanics were established as a baseline and then content was designed on top of that system they probably tried making characterbased stats more meaningful and wound up tuning them down to emphasize the job system decisions rather than characters but they left some minor differences there for people who are really interested in how the system works and want to completely optimize their team for fun  im telling you that ffv uses a fundamentally flawed systems that actively goes against itself  no it uses a system that goes against what you imagine the game is supposed to be about you appear to have an unhealthy fixation with controlling a characters stat growth personally i like growth dynamics but dont pitch a fit when a game doesnt include one in order to emphasize some other aspect of the game  whether galuf does a tiny bit more damage than bartz as a monk is irrelevant the statistical difference between the two is too small to ever be relevant  but its still there if someone really wants to see it the class side of the game is focused on picking a primary job then picking subabilities then selecting equipment each decision has a lesser impact on your characters stat profile
  tiny bit more damage   youre kinda low balling it this also relates to their respective speed value in said classwhich even speedruners have to keep in mind  now youre asking me why should those different stats actually matter  no just saying whats wrong with knightlenna being almost as good as anyone else in said class  bm bartz will be the same bm lenna  looking at their stats bartz is a little on the slower side and her magic beats him out by three you might think this doesnt matter much but its a clear gap with the right equipment same goes for white mage lenna will healing about 100 hp more than bartz which is clearly more optimal   so none  game that are very easy cant get harder by limiting yourself but the content youre facing is a actual threat to your progressionjob fiesta doesnt suddenly make ffv harder but cuts down on more of your options which kinda misses the point of the game
  game boy spinoffs  not an excuse  your argument boils down to final fantasy is easy  no my argument is simply that ff has no solid identity due to the general lack of direction and consistency in the series never once have i said that being easy equates to lack of identity being generic and inconsistent howerer is  but its fascinating how retarded you have to be to stick the term growth on there as if that matters  growth is literally what matters if i cant influence how characters grow im just using gimmicks changing equipment bonuses doesnt change anything and you know it which is why you started this autistic stream of consciousness as to prove anything any and all rpgs have equipment provide quirky additional bonuses ffiv has only that and even in that case its a gimmick a best especially because all characters are hard locked in a specific archetype  turns are valuable in final fantasy games  turns are never valuable in ff because the games do not have any sense of management of urgency not even the nes games with their limited inventory space do and you know it  it does if you want it to  nonsense  its a jrpg  even more nonsense come back when you have an actual argument instead of wasting four posts on nothing but autistic frothing and trying to change the subject  odd that you should say this as ff tactics is one game where the spell tiers really waste a lot of ability space  it isnt any more different than any other ff at least casting time tries to make an actual difference  who decided thats what they were supposed to do you  i wasnt the one who made a completely useless primary stat sheet for all five characters in the game that is mechanically useless blame the ffv team not me im just pointing out their mistakes
    but you cant say it makes the class system meaningless and you cant say that stats dont matter  where did i say that i said that the stat system is irrelevant not the class system classes and their toolsets are the only thing that matters i thought i have been clear about this    classes dictate your stats and due to the mix and match options and the low game difficulty stats hardly matter outside of a very simplistic fast/slow magic/weapon paradigm especially between characters which is why i said that characters are just a proxy for a class and not actual characters  what makes a blue mage worth your time isnt its stat sheet its their toolkit same with red mage which is nothing without its toolkit or the ranger or geomancer a good part of the toolkits for all classes are repurposed common tools too what makes the difference between a dragoon and a knight isnt their stats but their toolkits  youre kinda low balling it  rich coming from somebody who uses speedrunners as an argument expecting to be taken seriously  no just saying whats wrong with knightlenna being almost as good as anyone else in said class  that it fails in its own basic game design principles  i dont even know what youre trying to say youre seriously telling me that theres nothing wrong with the game actively going against its own mechanics  if the game didnt pretend that the characters are supposed to be different by giving them different main stat sheets i wouldnt really raise an eyebrow its full of games that make it explicitly clear by not doing this and having only a class stat sheet but ffv isnt like that ffv has two stat sheets of which only one matters this is unarguably faulty bloated and senseless design  you might think this doesnt matter much but its a clear gap with the right equipment  the right equipment comes far too late for any of that to matter
  same goes for white mage lenna will healing about 100 hp more than bartz  100hp or even 1000hp in a game with a 9999 range is beyond laughable dont ever try to pass this as a serious argument ever again for your sake    you spent four posts trying to change the subject posting deliberate nonsense and fallacious arguments and attacking me with assumptions  my tastes have nothing to do with any of this i dont like dq mechanically but i can still appreciate what it tries to do its simplistic but straightforward and concise even elegant in its own simplicity if you want to describe it as that even some rare ff are but ffv isnt one of those games its bloated full of mechanical elements that contradict each other or add meaningless bloat    and to be perfectly clear this isnt some kind of personal attack or vendetta against ffv its full of games like that even worse games than that but if theres something i truly cannot stand is pretending theres nothing wrong with a system that is barely put together even worse when you pretend you actually have some control in a prebaked almost completely automated system
   just got to this thread and i gotta say a few things     1the game balance is as always fucked what little difference in stats there is between characters is unimportant a mystic knight lenna is hardly different from a mk bartz on a statistical viewpoint what little damage or hp difference there might be is irrelevant    i gotta agree with you here on the fact that individual character base stats make a very small difference between characters with the same jobs i can see why they decided to leave it at that a more pronounced difference would have been too hard to balance they take the risk of railroading you into playing characters a certain way every time or intentionally gimping yourself     2your innate character stats are pointless since changing jobs alters the stat sheet to fit a template anyway on top of that you can change those further with other ability slots    they are not pointless anon just of the top of my head  1they dictate your combat abilities before you get any jobs duh   2they are taken into account to calculate your character abilities since your job lvl stat bonusses are just a part of the ecuation you seem think that job stat bonuses make character stats inconsequential ask yourself this   if while playing dragon quest 3 you were to make the terrible mistake of upgrading your class on all of your lvl 25 party at the same time instead of one at a time you would find yourself with a party so weak you would be forced to return to the starting area to grind your characters for hours and hours back to 25 halting progress completly   now in ff5 the stat bonuses and available toolset between a mastered class and a lvl0 class is pretty good but you can switch jobs at anytime with as many members as you want and simply catch up without halting progress to grind   what does ff5 have that dq3 doesnt     base stats anon get it now     cont
  cont    3changing jobs is essentially a soft optimized respec theres no commitment to character development nor is any real freedom you just swap between premade templates your mk bartz will always be the same exact mk bartz no matter how many times you play the game    this is true but cant be considered a valid criticism of the game because you can not fail at something you ever set out to do you sound like this     why doesnt bloodborne let me play as a classic tomb rider styled tps ammo and gun damage is unbalanced as fuck might as well not have guns they are pointless shit game from shit devs they cant program guns     ffv was never about being tes with chocobos your very own special mystic knight anon jobs are means to an end ffv has a modular growt system about mixing all the tools and stat bonuses you unlock while progressing in interesting ways as in finding that animals dance geo etc work very very diferent when mixed with other jobs and tool sets     endgame you have 46 mastered jobs with each character and a few extra abilities of the ones you didnt master but diped your toes nonetheless  you end up    building a cool freelancer party having inherited tools bonus stats and passive abilities depending on how you decided to play that especific run i guarantee you your party will have very diffent base stats by the end of the game given that they feed on mastered jobs and not just on character lvl    i guess you could grind 50/70 hours out of a game that is only 25/30 hours long you would end up with the same party for sure but why would you do that  you simply dont like the ff5 you dont understand what it sets out to do and should just play something else
  trying to change the subject  you cant even stay on subject because your initial assertion about series lacking identity was so insanely retarded that theres literally no defending it so you keep grasping at random irrelevant criticisms of isolated games many of which are stupid or outright wrong and thus generate counterarguments and derailment    growth is literally what matters  its literally not what matters what matters are elements that remain consistent between entries in the franchise thats how an identity is formed although if youre the kind of player who only plays rpgs for the level up to win dynamic it makes sense that the growth mechanic is the only one you actually notice  any and all rpgs have equipment provide quirky additional bonuses ffiv has only that  stat bonuses from equipment are not equally significant in all games equipments affect on stats are not equally significant in all games nor do stats mean the same thing in all games most importantly theres more to an rpg than the stat system ffiv has an activetime turnbased combat system which was unique at the time it was introduced and remained a defining trait of the series for the next five entries  turns are never valuable in ff  yes they are unless you level to win if you play aggressively they definitely matter and if you cant handle a relative comparison like this you have no business whatsoever making assertions about a series identity
  it isnt any more different than any other ff at least casting time tries to make an actual difference  once again youre just demonstrating you dont really understand the games that you play and probably arent very good at them thats fine but it means you arent qualified to make generalizations about the whole series    fft has a 3d battlefield grid and every single black magic spell has a nearly identical hit pattern higher ranks have a slightly larger zradius except for 4 which actually does hit a slightly larger xy pattern this is a huge waste of potential as there could have been black magic spells that used a variety of hit patterns mana costs and cast times that would lead to meaningful tactical decisions to make during combat since you dont seem to think about these games in terms of tactical decisionmaking and simply play leveltowin this is not surprising    furthermore the importance of cast time is skewed as you level in fft theres a huge advantage to hitting a target before it can take a turn which means a major advantage to the faster lower level spells this advantage only increases as unit speeds increase while cast times remain static    incidentally ffiv also has cast times on spells and they are very relevant its a shame later games did not keep them    oh also  game boy spinoffs not an excuse  spinoffs and tangents to a series dont say anything about the main series identity christ you are dense    furthermore in the case of a game like final fantasy legend that game came out at a time when square was not a recognizable brand in the west and the only other rpg they had released was final fantasy 1 so yeah you could say the series had no identity in the west because it wasnt a fucking series yet in na it was just a brand and the only one square had it was a smart decision
  rich coming from somebody who uses speedrunners as an argument expecting to be taken seriously  your argument suffers from the flaw in the opposite direction actual speedrunning goes way too far but at least playing a game aggressively and taking risks rather than progressing slowly and safely will get you far more familiar with the mechanics and their implications and give you a much better appreciation for how a game is designed
  if the game didnt pretend that the characters are supposed to be different by giving them different main stat sheets i wouldnt really raise an eyebrow its full of games that make it explicitly clear by not doing this and having only a class stat sheet but ffv isnt like that ffv has two stat sheets of which only one matters this is unarguably faulty bloated and senseless design  its clear you just dont understand the first thing about game systems or design if content designers decide they want the starting stats on characters to not have major differences for the sake of gameplay thats exactly the right place to do it and if those designers want to make minor differences to the stats just to show that yes the underlying system accommodates it thats also perfectly fucking fine only a complete fucking retard would argue that you should design a system that completely prevents you from assigning individual stats to characters to avoid some vague concept of bloat    if you look at most dd games made in the 80s and 90s none of them fully implemented the ruleset they all implemented some subset and on top of that implemented ruleset they only included a subset of the possible content that could be built on that system thats just a fact of game design content gets built on the system and a good system can support a wide variety of content that doesnt mean its bloated it means its a welldesigned system
  if while playing dragon quest 3  dq3 works on a fundamentally different model all around you cant compare it to ffv and your carefully crafted scenario is literally a newbie trap and doesnt go further than that moreover  you would find yourself with a party so weak  that wouldnt happen if equipment was actually implemented well eg like in saga games from which ff should have taken a clue or two in there its common to be able to recruit characters with extremely low stats even at the end of your playthrough due to the nonlinear nature of the games you know how those characters can carry their own equipment and much faster more balanced growth rate with no need of multiple stat tables that cannibalize each other a lot of other games also figured this out since decades how is it that ff couldnt and still cant   why doesnt bloodborne let me play as a classic tomb rider styled tps  because its not a tr style tps in the first place that is your argument for ffv that its somehow its own supposed style of rpg  im sorry i cannot take you seriously with this there are so many ways to fix ffv without compromising its structural integrity and purpose and most of those come down to simply making math formulas that actually matter cut out the bloat and making mechanics that actually matter instead of multiple layers of bloat that compromise themselves  how about adding proper weapon differences instead of flat multipliers so that weapon types arent just stat sticks with some rare stale gimmick such as elements or stat multipliers how about adding proper exp/ap bonuses tied to job level so whenever you switch youll be able to catch up fast how about fixing equipment relations to character stats so you dont need a pointless secondary sheet that is also unnecessarily complicated and a waste of space and time
  you cant even stay on subject  says the guy conflating my points about mechanical mistakes with my points about identity  stat bonuses from equipment are not equally significant in all games  i didnt deny that which is why i said there not in ffiv maybe you should take your time and read other peoples posts carefully instead of just vomiting insults and half baked posts  most importantly theres more to an rpg than the stat system  i agree and its a pity that ff games dont have something more to them other than that  yes they are unless you level to win  not really maybe you could say that for the early game for a few entries like 2 where enemies are actually dangerous but no the overwhelming majority of the series doesnt have any sense of turn urgency healing items abound healing magic is far too powerful for turns to matter you can reset anything to neutral with no effort since theres no proper economy or balancing to ff games  this is a huge waste of potential  i completely agree but what does that have to do with what i said about casting time specifically  fft has more holes than swiss cheese but im not here for that we could dedicate an entire thread to that but im not here for it  spinoffs and tangents to a series dont say anything about the main series identity  seems to me they do and also tell you a lot about how the creators see their own stuff  it was a smart decision  it wasnt in any possible way it was a short term solution to make money rebranding an entire series like that not only hurt the rebranded series itself it shows how they were already putting too many eggs in one basket and the fact that they were already treating ff as a label as ive already pointed out  ask yourself why dragon quest only had three spinoff series to this day only two which play wildly differently from the mainline and still have a lot more in common with each other than ff spinoffs have with their mainline
  dq3 works on a fundamentally different model all around you cant compare it to ffv    dq3 jobs are not meant to be modular and instead are a long term commitment not better or worse just a diferent vision for a job system but the fact that they decided to go with base stats job stats for dq6 onwards is sugestive that someone at enix liked the ff3 take so did all the copy cats that came later   i was merely explaning what is it that the base stats do in the game  you kept repating that they were pointless and i was merely being informative now you seem to have changed argument to  it does something but but we could totally remove it if we were to put something else in its place to cover the hole  is there more than one way to skin cat anon no shit sherlock     a lot of other games also figured this out since decades how is it that ff couldnt and still cant  i know right they could have totally experimented with ff2 and ff8 and gauge reception but they went with the classic route pussys     that is your argument for ffv that its somehow its own supposed style of rpg  my argument was that every game should strive to be unique in mechanics and aproach     you spend half your post saying every mechanic in ff5 sucks bar none and then listing a few great saga game mechanics wich ff5 does not feature in any shape way or form this makes them more of a sidegrade than substitute for the ff5 job system because there is no equivalent for it in saga either  there are classes and races but no jobs per se   ff taking tips from saga would be the equivalent of mario kart taking tips from fzero anon like what the fuck for they are made by the same people they are totally diferent by design were ment to scratch diferent itches and while one of them can be considered overall deeper and skill based and one of them streamlined and fuck around oriented not being able to apreciate both says more about you than ffv joyless contrarian kun
  you can also kill sarevok without being touched just abusing the retarded ai
guys help i want to like robopon but the input lag on this game is a massive turnoff even if i love the fact you can basically build your own cute robot to kill each other with are there other games that scratches this itch other than the medarot games
  ff taking tips from saga  would be actually good doesnt really take much to implement common sense stuff like weapons having different damage types actual statistical balance or having proper exp distribution nobodys asking for ff to be a saga clone just to learn the very basics of game design that arent even unique to that series thats literally all you need    i mean this is all the more embarassing for ff especially when you consider theyre both games from the same compaby and considering that unlike saga its a series of completely linear and railroaded games implementing those basic rpg features and having better balance would be a lot easier    but reading this thread i guess that the standard for ff is so low anything goes as long as you see big numbers flashing on the screen
  i already get to play both saga and classic ff i really dont see any gain at all from making them more similar  like there is a lot more bluberry and cheese ice cream than plain old but since i can eat both why would vanilla need to take take tips so we can get even less variety to pick from or do you mean mix both flavors because that has lot of more chances of sucking for everyone     if you mean current ff franchise then yeah a saga styled game getting half the budget a ff would be the dream or at least for you me and a few other enthusiasts
  there is a lot more to bluberry and cheese ice cream than plain old vanilla     well shitposting from my phone while playing on my hammoc
  i really dont see any gain at all from making them more similar  maybe actually read what ive written before posting this drivel  nobody fucking said ff needed or needs to become exactly like saga just to actually care about mechanics and balance like that series does  if you think having a tiny bit of mechanical polish and complexity would make ff too similar to saga i dont know what to tell you saga has maybe one or two mechanics unique to it the rest is just fucking common sense that ff never had blindly defending such an embarassingly bad franchise in this way is all the more pathetic
what are the best jrpg fantrans
  your arguments against ffs mechanics have been terrible you dont really come across as someone who has a solid grasp on what makes a good game much less a good rpg  blindly defending such an embarassingly bad franchise  its not blind defense your arguments have been all over the place the only consistent theme is a raging hateboner for final fantasy that seems to interfere with your ability to make any kind of astute criticism      says the guy conflating my points about mechanical mistakes with my points about identity  no this entire discussion started because you made an assertion about identity you made broad sweeping accusations against the final fantasy series and have been hilariously unable to actually support those claims with a coherent argument    i didnt deny that which is why i said there not in ffiv  ok spoonfeeding time i guess my point is what other games accomplish with a mix of stataltering features ffiv does primarily with items this is neither a positive or negative thing ffv is not inherently better because itembased stat mods are minimal while job/ability based mods are more substantial its just a different way to accomplish a similar thing so your attempt to criticize ffiv as having only one thing instead of having more like it should is just absolutely fucking retarded   its a pity that ff games dont have something more to them other than that  they do you are apparently just too dumb to notice to any of it
  mother 3
saga frontier 1 or 2  never played any of them but the idea of having to beat a game several times to actually beat it seems daunting
    dual orb 2
dragon quest 11 while not looking retro is the best representation of classic jrpg gameplay i ever played
  its almost as if its not a retro game
  completely different games despite sharing similar basic mechanics  but the idea of having to beat a game several times to actually beat it seems daunting  saga frontier has seven different mcs with seven different stories with content completely unique to each of those so its like having seven small games into one  saga frontier 2 is nothing like that its a single storyline over which you have next to no control over so its more like a standard story driven rpg outside of the missable stuff    frontier 1 is overall more newbie friendly than 2 though however to truly get everything out of the games narrative you need to play all the characters stories since each mc has lore and other things that other mcs do not there will also be a few conflicting events but saga games with multiple mcs tend to work on a quantum universe model where all the possibilities no matter how apparently contradicting are valid
  best action jrpg  here
  its retro in feel for sure
  not trying to sell you on ff anon clearly    sakaguchi must have kicked your puppy or something since so far you have not mention a single ff mechanic that you do like wich i find a little weird everything sucks really      as far as balance in saga you must be talking about the ones i have yet to play the ones on ps1 and onwards  the first three on gameboy are super unbalanced are easy to break ff8 levels of broken but without the shitty draw mechanic wich makes them some of the most fun i have ever had in vidya seriously charming games really but balanced is a word that doesnt fit with them   saga 1  monsters are a waste of a slot for the whole game mutants quickly become at least 3 times more useful than humans by the end of the first world makes you wish you had recruted 4 of them and went balls to the wall by half the game you already hit the limit in most stats by the 4th world you can actually spare cash to upgrade your humans do they catch up not only that since their stat limit is actually 25 times that of mutants you now wish you had 4 humans instead  saga 2 is the same but with robots growth between racess is still all over the place but at least there no useless races anymore this is but far my favourite feels more polished but still fun to break  saga 3 is very meh adopts a level based growth system while still retaining all of the old systemsand races not tied to stat growth overall the most balnaced but way too easy charming still but becomes predictable gameplay wise    cont
   cont    now rs2 is balanced for sure in a very very restrictive way every character you recruit apart from your heir is only good for one thing and pasable in another maybe trying to waste ap teaching them something is a waste of time by the next generation jump they will be back with gains only in areas that fit their predertermined uses  the scaling system is whack as well some scenarios feel too hard and some too easy since the game takes only takes into acount battles fought and cares not for what you actually fought wich is pretty random any given encounter can contain either a single low tier and net you no reward  or 6 strong ones and and windfall of ap this makes the difficulty curve erratic and is easily exploitable as well should you wish to make make an easy speedrun    the scenarios are interesting the make you feel like shaping history half the time and an errand boy the rest    boss battles and hard encounters are super fun debuffs and physical skills are pretty useful and varied if only the difficulty of sparking new abilities didnt discourage the use of some old knesbut overall great combat     the story is ok but since your party has no personality and are just generic units     i have yet to play newer entries in the series will get to it in time but overall i liked the gb games way more
  if you want a game with multiple possibilities a banging soundtrack and an intense atmosphere get saga frontier 1    if you want a story that span generations of your mcs ingame and enjoy seeing your actions carry weight with a gorgeous painterly aesthetic to boot get saga frontier 2
  fuck you nigger the suikoden games are great

  depends on what you mean and what you want from the game  most major plot threads are tied up by the end but it takes a long time to get there and some of it is convoluted some sections of the game drag but fei bangs elly above mahanon  the gameplay never really gets much better foot combat is pretty easy and boring unless you really enjoy the animations gear combat does get gradually better to a point as you get some more options but not dramatically so
i love these first person console rpgs fromsoftware was making before switching to souls and their ilk the kings field series the shadow tower series eternal ring theres something very satisfying about exploring a world as this slowlywalking dude with your end goal being simple and yet so distant as you have to traverse these vast yet so compactfeeling dungeons and worlds filled to the brim with scores of different enemies and traps tapping walls like a loon when trying to find secrets and collecting various items magic and tons of equipment and also finding various helpful or not so much npcs wish my descriptions could do them justice but they are definitely way more niche than souls
    when you load it into a clay pigeon launcher and blast it to hell
  based    ok
  omg that filter is disgusting  fucking sprites fuck
  shining in the darkness  no shining force
  turn based tactics games such as xcom and jagged alliance definitely fit your bill  but turn based combat rpg not many do some of them really are hard as shit though i recommend disciples of steel if you think theyre too simple or easy
  shining force 3 is on saturn and its the main reason i bought a saturn
  honest question is this still worth playing if you fucking hate mario both as a franchise and the character
is it good something about it bugs me but i cant put my finger on it
  no it sucks  graphics over gameplay is never good
  what in your opinion sucks about the gameplay i cant think of anything outright bad but for some reason i just get annoyed playing it but i cant think of a single factor like bad controls cheapness etc
  design wise there really isnt a single unique or interesting thing about it the gameplay may not be bad but its stale when plenty of other games from this generation did this style of gameplay before and better
    the gameplay is fucking great love using vectormans boost to kill enemies
  name 3
  because you dont understand momentum physics play some sonic
  i love sonic and dont feel annoyed playing any of those games with vectorman i just feel like shit is annoying for some reason
the only problem that this game has is the small viewable screen area it causes some issues with enemies suddenly appearing right outside your viewing area other than that the actual gameplay is absolutely fine and it plays faster and smoother than a lot of other platforming shooter type games
  the second one will bug you even more because the villains are bugs and whats worse the design sucks
  holy shit are you me  the game seems like its objectively good but for some reason i just dont like it the controls arent bad but the platforming feels wonky the gameplay is good but the levels and enemies feel uninspired but the game isnt bad at all
    the second one has some shitty level design but i still enjoy giving it a run every now and then
  its a good game but its more tedious than it needs to be by giving you limited time with powerup weapons and it can take a long time to kill enemies with the basic shot i alleviate this by using game genie to remove the time limit on powerup weapons makes the whole game a lot more fun to me i think i might try to blast through it again tonight like that actually
amass like 4 extra guys in the first level  lose them all in the nonsensical bonus stage immediately after it    yeah something tells me this game is not too great
  this is true it basically forces you to never stop firing which gets tiresome
  shitty megaman style with a giant hitbox
  the bosses are too hard
  its not a bonus stage thats the actual second level
  its good if you enjoy playing it    what the fuck is it with kids these days who cant think for themselves on a even basic level its like youre all itching to be sheep who get told what to like abd how to like it
  this thread again huh its a decent game that is easily worth the ten bucks or so it garners but its nothing special outside of graphics if you really like it play the sequel but be warned that it is a step down not much more to say on the matter
  this
  well guess we should shut down the board guys this guy says theres no point in asking others about their feelings on anything thus eliminating all need for discussion and with it discussion boards
  nice way to totally miss the point not every thread must start with the same predictable words you know a simple lets talk about x game or x genre is way better a silly op who wants to be shamelessly spoonfed wants to be a contrarian etc without even trying deserves to either be ignored or bashed upon  luckily though i saw some threads way worse than this one but that doesnt change the fact that the average user of /vr/ should be different than a kid of /v/ so i expect most of them to be way more mature
its a little overrated but i like it the sequel is worse in every way though
  its not the deepest platformer but i have fond memories of it its one of personal favorites i can clear in an afternoon if im bored the music and aesthetic are what make it    vectorman 2 sadly is shit replaces unique orbrobot enemies with generic bug enemies longer tedious levels that drag the game out longer than it should beand vectorman suddenly has a deeper voice that sounds more stilted and doesnt match his character it was one of the first games i remember anticipating its release a kid and it took awhile for me admit how much a step down it was music is still pretty good      
  its not say as interactive as megaman where in this game you move very quickly but the screen is zoomed in a bit so youre walking very fast but also have to be cautious because you can run into things very quickly so youre constantly pressing the walk button then waiting so you dont bump into enemy plus megaman had unique enemy encounters and memorization where this game you stand still and blast something until it dies very unfun game design the game does look unique though and some of the soundtracks nice i think the only thing that saves this game is the sky background
  its good but not amazing some of the level designs are tedious and samey to the point of being mazelike the sprites being so fuckhuge that you can only see 2 feet in front of you sucks too its a big problem with a lot of 16bit games also the time limit can really fuck you over sometimes      probably the worst part of the game you literally die in 2 seconds because you have no idea what you are looking at at first
  its pretty fun  soundtrack kicks ass
  it might just be because ive been playing this game for 20 years but i have no problem just running through and blasting stuff it plays a lot faster than a typical mega man game and once youve memorized the stages its a breeze
  it reuses the same assets for most of the game most of the levels are color palette swaps of level 1 it was an ugly game back then too to me the sequel is a worse game but at least the levels are more varied
  i mean you do have parts where you aim above or below you so its not that simple i just wish the game didnt feel so zoomed in and you walked so fast atleast give a run button or something if i look hard enough i could see this game being decent perhaps this is a case of american design where they enlarge all the sprites and everything has weird hitboxes
  way easier than mega mans
it really grinds my gears that this of all games chastises you at the end if you use codes really this is the game thats gonna do that how about you didnt fill the game with sections where an enemy will just smack you from beneath the ground youre standing on or constantly respawning mosquitos who dont appear until you jump into them    i realized on my recent playthrough you can look up and down if you hold the buttons something i never realized before that helps but honestly not the kinda game you wanna constantly do that every few seconds it fucks up the flow

did anyone take a look at lsd dream emulators prices lately i caved years ago and memed myself into buying it for 250 cad now its about 8001600 for a copy
did you buy it for actually playing or just collecting
look at sold listings not the current asking price it still goes for 200400 no one is paying 8001600 maybe one or two people have
  ive played it quite a lot already i was just looking at prices currently not just lsd but so many fucking games have skyrocketed years ago was okay but now being a retrofag is just fucked up i can clearly see the justification behind flashcarts now
  youre just a noob yes prices have slightly increased but you dont know what youre doing and are exaggerating
  youre just a noob  fuck off faggot
is it actually rare though or just inflated by memelords i cant ever imagine a psx game being rare
  have you filled in the entire grid i remember playing the game for like a whole month any only filling out 60 of it and one time i got a square that was not even on on the main grid it was all the way to the right outside the box where they should go after that it played i think every video cutscene back to back
  both but more of the latter
theres also the book called the dream diary with pictures of the dreams the game was based on last saw it at 80000 and now cant find it
i remember it being like 80 on yja in 2012
  yup check the price every few months usually when an underage poorfag shitposts about how prices have collapsed because he bought a chink everdrive feels fucking good dont even like it just picked up copies when it was cheap before it was a hipster thing and way before it was a meme
is there anything better than real physical media
first post
i write the platform release year and developer on my discs

  anon im not being facetious when i say this i wish we couldve met under different circumstances we could be friends or even more but as things are im afraid our chosen roles are destined to collide i am filled with regret please do not hate me hate the image you perceive me projecting if you must but not me i would love you given the chance

  hes right you know
  making big cums
  i dont understand why people are still burning discs in the era of flash drives and external storage i can understand owning the actual retail version but burning discs is a waste
  sd card solutions are still pretty expensive and not widely available yet but once they are things will change on the saturn for example much easier to just get an action replay for 3040 bucks and play burned games
  its like making your own repros you mad you threw out all your burners friendo
  i dont understand much of anything  ftfy
  i dont understand why people want to spend less money
  when games used to be sold in large boxes with manuals and other goodies
  yeah the actual game i dont get why so many people are obsessed with real world things i understand you need hardware to properly play things perfectly but as far as extras like boxes maps magazines  give me a pdf any day

  i only burn discs for my sega saturn and dreamcast the sega saturn sd card loader costs somewhere like 800 orders are only open at certain times of the year and he sells out extremely quick for a fraction of that price i can get an action replay or a preflashed cart and a stack of 100 cdrs the dreamcast antipiracy is virtually nonexistent and can play cdrs with no modification to the console itself    ps1 games i get eboots of them and play them on my psp
  all my pussy is digital
  cant argue with that
using howlongtobeatcom i made an excel file for my backlog heres the total estimated hours for each system as you can see retro systems are vastly superior to modern systems
  and here it is for nintendo
    spending 500 hours on nugame shit    i see youre mentally ill im sorry
  1 youre asserting that longerbetter which is not always the case it rarely is actually     2 this doesnt mean jack shit if we dont know how many games or downloaded roms/isos you have in your backlog per system
  86 hours for the n64 library what i dont think you know what youre doing
  replaying mario 64 autistically for two decades doesnt mean shit
  backlog doesnt mean games i already played by the way
i hope that nes backlog is short because youve already played most of the games please post how many games are in each category
    n64 is pretty shitty in quantity of games its not dreamcast but its pretty close    i would think this only counts exclusive games
  roughly 6200 hours solely in playstation consoles  playing two hours a day it would take nearly ten years to get through just the playstation backlog  anon i dont think youre going to make it
  ps1    its games i either havent played never beat as a kid because i had rented it or games i havent played in 20 years so i want to play them again all the way through one time as an adult    nes games themselves are all super short    who the fuck only plays 2 hours a day besides im retired at 28 years old i have all the fucking time in the world
backlog  the idea of this makes me cringe i too have many games ive never beaten some i havent even tried yet but i just play the games i want whenever i feel like it i dont feel bad for replaying a game ive already played to death if im having fun playing video games isnt a job nor an accomplishment
  ps2 part 1    also in bound to not like a bunch of them so ill try them and delete them if i dont like them i just have them downloaded for when i do want to try them in case piracy becomes too hard in 20 years
  ps2 part 2    ok do you know backlog means none of the random shit you had rattled off is relevant i play what i want too dumb ass i just keep track of all the options mostly out of curiosity
  who the fuck only plays 2 hours a day  sleep 7 hours  work 9 hours including lunch break  round up to 1 hour for commute total  1 hour to cook and eat dinner  1 hour total for showeringshitting pissing fapping  1 hour walking dog  1 hour for miscellaneous errands  1 hour exercising   that leaves about 23 hours for gaming
  ps3 part 1      forgot to mention the ones where the time is black are ones in not going to play i just put them there to remind myself that theyre shit and i shouldnt download them that way i dont think i forgot them or something several years from now
  work 9 hours including lunch break  im retired had a payed lunch when i did work and didnt work 7 days a week   round up to 1 hour for commute total  my job was 15 minutes away because i made sure to live close to work again dont have one now   1 hour to cook and eat dinner  cooking takes me like 15 minutes   1 hour total for showeringshitting pissing fapping  1 hour walking dog  i have a cat   1 hour for miscellaneous errands  1 hour exercising   that leaves a shit ton of time for gaming
  ps3 part 2  the lists get much shorter from here
    ps4
  psp
  nes    the only nes games i like are action platform platform or puzzle
  snes
  n64    this counts games ill play on that platform regardless of whatever else theyre on    ive already beaten ocarina major and m64 after that this is pretty much it dk64 kirby64 glover and so on are all complete fucking trash
  gamecube i prefer most multi plats on gamecube because of how great dolphin runs
  wii  wii u
  gba i beat a lot of these as a kid but wasnt to play them again once through as an adult
  the complete sega list                        forgot to mention that this doesnt include any kind of multiplayer only stuff this all just based on being the main game/campaign whatever
  graph of genres just in case some dip shit wants to say hurt durr its all jrpgs
  work 9 hours  the fuck
  8 hour work day 1 hour for lunch what is there to misunderstand
fuck the next gen of consoles     ai hasnt advanced since ps2 physics havent advanced since ps3 no new storage format no new tech like online or bluetooth the ram boost from ps3 to 4 was enough to display as many objects as youll ever need etc    theres nothing to do but small graphics improvements 99 of people wont give a single fuck about due to diminishing returns i give zero shits about games looking better than they do now     what i do care about is the development costs spiking again while decimating the install base making it so that awesome niche games dont get made until the install base builds back up again over 10 years yay less games and less risk taking for another 10 years oh and 300 gb game installs on a 1 tb hard drive
    i miss when games were just games and they werent ashamed of it why does mario collect coins because its a fucking video game if board games all tried to become movie simulators people would be nostalgic for scrabble and monopoly    idiot aaa devs dont understand that classics like megaman castlevania sonic metroid zelda and so on are not inferior relics of their time but fun games with their own unique rules and mechanics that their modern updates completely lack when they say this kind of shit is obvious that theyre not real gamers just losers that couldnt make it in the film industry     imagine if they stopped making ovens toaster ovens and grills the second the microwave came out thats how fucking stupid mainstream video game publishers are
    people spend more times organizing and listing their games than if they actually just sat down and played the games
  genre  zelda
  yup its a zelda clone adventure is a stupid fucking label when that also includes broken sword and line 50 other completely different kinds of game
  nah it was pretty easy
  this pasta tastes like shit
i made the list for myself just with notes about completion rate beaten/failed difficulty current progress etc
categorizing your collection by hours to beat seems unneeded and a bit stressful  honestly i just grab complete romsets now and play whenever but i do add the game to a beat list without logging time
  complete romsets are 9999 garbage
  how are you retiring at 28  im unemployed and jealous
    1get a mediocre middle class job  2continue to live like a broke college kid despite being able to afford all kinds of dumb bullshit  3pirate everything  4dump the rest of your money into vtsax and rental properties in middle and upper middle class neighborhoods  5live in one of your apartments while youre neighbors pay your bills
  youre only retired as long as you have tenants for all of your rentals if something drives them away then youve only got your stocks
  its the easiest way to always have what you want though
  do not engage with that shitposting retard im a few years his senior i assure you thats not how life works does it really have to be a tripfag before you fags get it nothing good will come from listening to bs like that
    lol are you fucking kidding me my properties which are all in nice neighborhoods could be at 50 vacancy and id still be fine you dont know what the fuck youre talking about and yes the stock is enough for me to live off just not extravagantly the rentals are what allows me to do fun shit
    also think about this if the sky falls all of my properties explode and the insurance company goes bankrupt and all my stocks tank forever then the worst day of my entire fucking life is what everyone else experiences every single monday the day i go back to work
  why do you even give a shit what people spend their time on
  n64 only has like 20 good games
    i dont but if you share your stupid shit with the internet dont get surprised when the internet calls you stupid
    why isnt solstice on the nes list i must assume youve already beat it
  i hate you because i want to be like you
  wait until youre a boomer with kids and you have 2 free hours a night and think about dying all the time you get real systemic about that stuff
    do it its super easy and replicable just get these books used on amazon and read them    the simple path to wealth  this one explains in great detail why using low cost index funds such as vtsax is a fool proof strategy despite market crashes and so on and why day trading is for morons     early retirement extreme  this one is all about how people waste all their time and money on retarded shit and it didnt take as much money to retire or live as people think now im not even 1/3 as extreme as the author but theres lots of actionable ideas and great philosophy in the book    rich dad poor dad or the richest man in babylon  these two are made for people with low financial sense read these if you have any credit card debt or always feel like youre broke    the e myth  if you want to do anything entrepreneurial on your path to retirement read this book or you will fail    the millionaire next door  this one is a bunch of data from guys who researched millionaires for a marketing company the marketing company was very angry to learn that millionaires are very frugal and tough to sell shit too some quick facts  80 of american millionaires acquired their wealth in 1 generation from mundane businesses like real estate tow truck company plumbing company etc they drive used american cars and live in middle class neighborhoods where they usually have 8 times the wealth of their next door neighbors and most of their neighbors have no idea    read these get a completely mediocre middle class job i worked in machining never finished my engineering degree and early retirement becomes a breeze
  kids arent a big deal every guy i know who says this has a wife whos a completely useless bitch and like a onions boy he puts up with her being lazy as fuck    some tips   you can hire a house cleaner for nothing between dusting mopping sweeping dishes and laundry why waste up to 2 hours a week doing something you can pay a highschool dropout or mexican to do for you even if they charge 15/hr where you live only 10 in ohio it makes more sense for you to work 2 hours of overtime or something while you pay them to do dumb shit for you even if you make the same as what theyre charging the time and a half will make it so you got the same amount of work done but actually made money in the process thus doing things yourself doesnt actually save money unless your time is worth less than everyone elses    same goes for cooking you can hire a broke ass culinary arts student from your local college to make food thats way better than anything you can make for pretty cheap have them make a giant amount and keep a bunch in the fridge use your time to make more money than they make or play some fucking video games     also pros are better than you at what they do and they do it faster so what cost more the 1 hour it takes a mechanic to fix your car or the 4 hours it takes you to do the same job even if he makes twice as much as you doing it yourself costs more than paying him to do it while you work    apply these time management concepts to your life and unless youre a single dad with 6 kids or an unemployed not retired loser youll suddenly find that youre not stressed out anymore and have plenty of time in your day
  nes  170 hours  dragon warrior 1 2 3 and 4 combined should already take like 120 hours  ultima and romance of the three kingdoms are also long games
  and none of them are good
  isnt that the most frustrating puzzle platformer ever made
gow codatelier  transformers and battlefield games   jesus christ
what a fucking mess op why would ou waste tie like that why label and count games by hours instead of liking them or not i dont really see a point to this gigantic mess seriously why play a fighting game 5 hours whats the point may as well not play it or how about replaying a game you liked why not count that or the possibility of that happening i know youre trying to organize your backlog but this method is a shitty clusterfuck of a mess
  rogue galaxy  33 hours  only if you rush the game like hell    la pucelle tactics  33 hours  no way    growlanser games  anything less than 2530 horu    shining tears  no time  lel zelda  its an arpg 15 to 20 hours top iirc      arcana heart 3  5 hours  for what it doesnt even have a story per se just some blabs before battle and a ending scene otherwise you didnt even scratch the surface    atelier  anything below 30 to 40 hours  kek    disgaea 4  disgaea d2  if youre going for the story only 20 to 25 hours is enough otherwise 100hours for all the content      shining soul 2  10 hours  zelda  arpg 20 hours over 40 if youre going for the advance/hard mode    and i give up on the rest just some pointers for you op
  i figured id give the story modes a chance if i dont like them ill delete them never played any cod     classic god of war games are fun go back to /v/ with your bandwagon bullshit nu god of war is completely irrelevant to the first 6
  i included the games i plan to replay the fighting games are based on the single player content    the reason is because i like to knock out the shortest shit first usually depends on my mood
  when i play jrpgs i use avoid encounter cheat codes because grinding is fucking retarded and most jrpgs are piss easy try it sometime if im under leveled ill turn the encounters back on for a little while then turn them back off again i usually turn encounters on when i first enter a new area just to check out the kinds of enemies there then turn them back off also disgaeas mountain of post game content is trash i beat 1 and 3 and dont enjoy anything after the story grinding is for npcs and autists so since i play this way i used how long to beats rushed times even though i dont rush i play normally but with the gelding cut out
  why even play then just why ill never understand faggots like you by the way hope you die a painful slow death op    i beat 1 and 3 and dont enjoy anything after the story   but you for some reason enjoy those shit stories and cheap writing the only valuable thing disgaea has going for it is the fun grind even the music isnt that great
    1 has a pretty enjoyable story and some good comedy 3 wasnt that great probably why i havent summoned the well to play the others even though i hear theyre better than 3    the story battles have the most thought put into them a lot of them are like puzzles where the devs actually put thought into what unit went where everything else is just randomly generated trash i hate procedurally generated content wide as the ocean deep as a puddle only 2 digit iq autists would ever call grinding fun literally just get a fucking job if you like working hand crafted maps and hand crafted battles thats where its at    with other jrpgs the only fun is the story exploring and boss fights fighting the same random encounters over and over that require zero thought at all is not fun if you have a 3 digit iq further more if youre under leveled from having not killed a million slimes the boss fights turn into more challenging puzzles its the best way to play
im going to be that guy and point out that hltbcom can be horribly inaccurate
  better than nothing and honestly ill bet 99 of the time the people who dispute the times are either adumb asses that think the 3000 hours they spent playing multiplayer counts it doesnt or bsome shitter that took twice as long to beat it as everyone else and is in denial about being a shitter    i know its not perfect but its good enough theres also a more detailed breakdown of you actually click on a game
    solstice isnt that hard at all but it is a puzzle platformer and it is quite fun
  ill check it out
  the story battles have the most thought put into them  you clearly havent played the post content
  some theres post content that is designed just like the story content but not the dumb fucking item worlds and all thad randomly generated bullshit i do the post game content that doesnt require 100 hours of grinding to get to
is this the best retro wrestlevania
  im better at it then you
based western boxart aki wrestling games poster
i liked wwf raw
2000 is best come at me bros
  not op but ill reverse or block every single thing you try come get some bitchboi
    revenge is better
  yes this is probably the only third party game nintendo can really hold over the ps1 and aaturn
youre looking for this
  id take fire pro g or 6ms over slow mercy any day
  i wish this existed with a modern wwe roster    wwe immortals is sort of like that although that game made me wish there was a proper wwe fighting game with exaggerated personas
  its a free country youre allowed to be wrong
  holy based
  women will never understand wwf no mercy
  go thing for you innit
  yes but fire pro wrestling d or world through steam is a super close 2nd
the great debate
i prefer balloon fight overall but have more nostalgia for joust
love joust but joust 2 is superior
without hesitation joust its faster harder more exciting has cooler style graphics and sound it also came 2 years before which makes balloon fight a blatant clone its still a good game and it has balloon trip which is cool but joust is so much better in almost every way
  balloon fight has balloon trip mode and music by hip tanaka so is obviously superior
baloon kid is pretty cool
  she looks awfully happy about being eaten by that fish
  tags willing vore underage
whats your high score  ive been playing for like a week im still pretty shit but 100000 is pretty decent
  not bad i was playing the saturn port on midways arcade classics last night and got 139k there might be slowdown that makes things easier on that version though are you using mame i ll play a few rounds on mame tonight and come back with my top score
  are you using mame  yeah  previously though i was playing on the midway collection on ps2
    joust played it all the time in the arcades great game    never saw balloon fight until years after it was out on the nes played it and discovered it was just a poor copy of joust
i feel like joust has better physics  and it feels great to catch eggs in midair  its a lot harder too  and i love the art
  nah the vertical screen just doesnt work as well for joust its cool if youve played the hell out of joust 1 though if you want something a bit different
  vertical screen is bad  for a game where the screen wraps  no
  i didnt think anybody actually liked joust 2 nice to see that the programmers didnt totally waste their time
  just played a few games on mame and i can confirm the saturn port has so much slowdown in comparison   last night i got 139k first try on the saturn tonight it took a good few tries to get a comparable score in mame   i hope you can beat this anon it would motivate me to go for something higher
  im going to bed now but ill definitely try tommorow this games super fun probably my favorite arcade game ever now used to be robotron which i still love but i think joust beats it
  i hope you can beat this anon it would motivate me to go for something higher  anon i will beat it tomorrow too too late to start now
see thread  see scores  hey this game looks easy and fun lets try it on my nes  58k  im terrible
  nes version has wonky physics  try it on mame or one of the arcade compilations that has it  or 7800 version iirc thats the best contemporary home version
    ill be looking forward to seeing that
  joust 2 feels a bit bloated to me the beauty of joust was in its simplicity imo
  here ya go damn just found out my soundboard isnt making sounds joust is strange without sounds gonna have to pull the sound board and see if anything funky is going on
  oh dang you have an actual machine thats rad  how much did you get it for
  well i traveled about 5 hours to get it it was probably around 2010 or maybe a few years before i found it on craigslist for 50 it had major issues though the guy that had it was living down a logging road in mn looked like we would be murdered and it was a ploy to get us to his abandoned trailer with misc outbuildings built from scrap metal turns out he was a hell of a good guy and even helped me load the machine    i did what i could on it but at the time i had no electronics experience so i fixed the mechanical and cosmetic issues i ended up sending the boards to bob roberts damn fine arcade tech who has since retired bob said it was the strangest set of issues he had ever seen he would fix something then it would inadvertently go crazy again he would track that down and then upon a burn in test something else would go nuts bob was a master at repairing arcade games but this took him probably 2 months i had an email chain he would tell me what he found what worked what went wrong etc he said he had never seen a board like this but he thinks it must have had some huge electrostatic shock coupled with other issues from an age all in all i think he used 120 worth of parts and only charged me 40 for labor since he said it was interesting and also since he had it for so long bob roberts was a freaking legend i put a set of new joysticks in it they were repros but exactly as the original sheet metal had to order those from the uk i believe iirc the kit for each stick was 40 all in all i think i ended up with about 400 in it at the time i pretty much did all you can do to it replaced the ram with same spec that runs cooler and also a switching power supply    now ive found the soundboard needs looked at but i have experience now so i will fix it myself
  i grew up with joust and never knew it had a sequel until a few years ago when i finally downloaded a mame set to me joust was always about highspeed reflexive action with a bit of strategy thrown in and joust 2 does all that i like the transformation mechanic since you really need to react quickly to what is around you and take on whatever form is better suited to handle that exact moment i can take or leave the bosses but the core gameplay is fucking great
  nice score man and cool that you have the real hardware this score doesnt seem too out of reach so ill definately try to beat it and post back if i do the amount of lives given is like a testament to how hard this game is i cant think of any other arcade game giving more lives
  funfact the nes version of the game was programmed by satoru iwata and had more fluid jump physics than the arcade version the programmer of the nes version was so impressed and asked iwata how he did it the formula for the jumping physics would later be used in super mario    so if joust didnt exist then balloon fight probably would have never been made without balloon fight super mario would have probably sucked like most other platformers of the day and gaming would be completely different today
  the programmer of the nes version was so impressed    fuck i meant arcade version aaarrgg i wonder if 4chan would be worse or better if people could edit their posts
  the first time i heard about it was on the ps2 midway arcade treasures disc i only mention it because its a pretty good port and there is also either a video or some cool info on the disc about it i think there were 500 made iirc    i definitely like 2 and it has some fun level design but i do find myself playing 1 quite a bit more i think i like it for its simplicity and ive never been one to chase high scores but this game is an acception
  far far worse  just think about it for a few seconds
    sadly i didnt get a lot of time to play today but im hoping this thread stays up a while
  i guess it comes down to whether you prefer the dueling of joust or the balloon trip mode
joust all the fucking way
whats the best way to kill pterodactyls if youre not playing on the red rom version
  without balloon fight super mario would have probably sucked like most other platformers of the day and gaming would be completely different today  hardly ony the floating mechanic was ported over to smb for the swimming levels balloon fight doesnt have jump physics
    also mario bros 1983 arcade game was directly influenced by joust
    i didnt know this but i did see iwatas joust on nes which was amazing    i prefer joust but i still play balloon fight today theyre both incredible games
i played the 2600 version with my brothers when we were kids was pretty fun
  looks like hes having a fantastic time
  probably still on his first quarter
  balloon fight because of the nostalgia
  joust played it all the time in the arcades   no you didnt
  great debate  yeah its been raging all summer
  this board is full of boomers  stop projecting
didnt see one so i figured id try and get the ball rollin    the heydey of dos had a lot of good games made with ascii symbols and text display tricks out the ass retrofriends these days are always talking dorf fort and roguelikes and those are great but i dont see any love for the oneoff weird and sometimes forgettable adventure/mystery/whatever games that also used these graphics feel free to talk roguelikes and dorf fort if you want though idgaf friends     pic related is the one i probably spent the most time playing it was pretty awesome     tinny beep boop music  town sequences where youd question npcs with a menu system and an ominous spoopy low res render of transylvania or wallachia or whatever  dive sequences where you go inside houses and its pic related with ascii turn based combat and exploration    does anybody else remember the time when finding a single oneoff ascii character filled you with imagination and excitement not even a sprite but something like a weird t in a different font that meant you were going to have the cool sword or a rare item or something no graphics or lographics ascii games thread
  wallachia  game is named dracula in london    oh right fuck if i know its been a dogs age since i played it
    i had a lot of fun playing zzt and there were a lot of content creators doing really cool stuff with the scripting engine
  oh wow i played that too thats one i was trying to think of when i was making the op i remember someone made a castlevania game in the engine with a scripted whip and jump physics it was fairly wonky but the novelty of running custom content in this engine was awesome
  no results found for lographics ascii  you might want to explain what your made up term means otherwise someone might unwittingly post about it sending you into a fit of the vapors this is very likely considering you posted a pic of a cga game as opposed to something made with ascii symbols and text display tricks out the ass obligatory wew lad for being a lad and retarded
  ok    theres dudes in that screenshot represented by like text symbols and stuff    but i guess if im not welcome on vr cuz i didnt recall the proper technology for an era of games i was demonstrably having trouble recalling ill just go bruv
  nigger this whole site is dogshit
  fit of the vapors    wahhhh  called it  of course new /v/abies coming here acting like this is /v/ arent welcome lurk moar and behave like an adult and youll get a better reception
  thread is about to become a shit fest but youre the one over here who inaccurately claimed my screenshot of ascii symbols in a game would not be considered a game that used ascii symbols we could be talking about your favorite msdos games right now but you had to sperg out over made up terms as if a one off adjective was the new zeitgeist    cancerous sekrit clubism this is the only board i even go on and none of the conversations are up to your bullshit standards stop lying to yourself sweetie
  yikes cringe
  jesus christ this is depressing to read
this board is for the discussion of classic or retro games retro gaming means consoles computer games arcade games including pinball and any other forms of video games on platforms launched in 1999 and earlier with the release of the 8th generation of consoles the sega dreamcast will now be considered retro though the remainder of the sixth generation xbox ps2 gamecube will not    helpful links  game tech wiki  emulation general wiki
what did you think of the snes mode 7 at the time
i thought it was p cool
  it was cool the sprite scaling was really neat
  nothing  i was like i dont know 7 or 8  i didnt really understand what it was or why it was impressive the improved graphics and sound compared to the nes were much more impressive to me than this particular gimmick
  i thought it was a good solution to doing fake 3d on an under powered system
  gimmick  just no
  i kinda agree but for racing games only it looks like a total mess and isnt fun at all for something like contra 3 or pilotwings its pretty cool though
  it was though you faggot
  yes its a gimmick
people didnt care there was better stuff in the arcades long before ps1 and n64 era is when people really started caring about 3d because there werent games like mario 64 ever before stuff that was marketed as being 3d or prerendered was usually taken with a grain of salt with the exception of pc/dos games like doom
  i came here for hyperzone
  it was impressive but the novelty quickly wore off when thats all it had for quite some time that is until nintendo and others started producing the expansion chips like superfx      mode 7 never scaled sprites only a tilemap layer though some programmers did a very good job convincing players that massive scaling and rotating objects were sprites that you could interact with       a defining feature   merely a gimmick  zzoozoomers gtfo
   ps1 and n64 era is when people really started caring about 3d   what is the pc i am a clueless zoomer that was born yesterday  you need to leave
  defining feature    or used in a limited amount of games a few of them big    in other words    a gimmick
i wonder how many minds would have been blown if something like this came out at the time when the sega was relevant  
  pretty sure i mentioned pc in my post did you not read the whole thing there were even atari games that did smooth 3d visuals like robot tank
  everyone would of just said it looks like a shitty mario kart
  limited amount of games  fuck off you clueless fucking faggot
  ugly it ruined the ff6 map
  you mean dos roms
i liked it felt like the arcade experience was in my home some games did make use of it in a gimmicky way but i also thought they were cool
  ffivs map used mode 7 when you were in the airship
  no its not a gimmick when its useful its very useful and can make entire games possible that otherwise wouldnt be nearly as good like fzero and smart developers can use it tastefully like square did in final fantasy iv which was subtle enough that someone in this very thread obviously didnt even know about it
  its kind of a gimmick but thats not a bad thing
it was essential for racing games for everything else it was a gimmick
  i thought pic related was impressive as well as the toy story/jurassic park fps sections although not sure if those were actually mode 7 or not
     the toy story/jurassic park fps sections although not sure if those were actually mode 7 or not    they werent you need super fx to rotate/scale anything but the 2 backgrounds you get with mode 7 and toy story had a similar 3d level on genesis
  i saw it initially in photos and thought it meant the snes had scaling graphics like a sega or snk arcade game but i was disappointed when it found it cant scale sprites
    that was partially wrong sorry both games are bruteforcing the graphics entirely through software without using the standard snes background and sprite setups including mode 7
  i still think its a pretty neat effect desu i like how it gives the perceived impression of full 3d movement dunno i just think its cool looking
  i never thought much of it i was just a kid and things like hardware limitations and sprite scaling/rotation capabilities were lost upon me anyway
  back when it came out there was a huge crowd of kids around an f zero demo at the store and everyone was taking turns crashing into the walls and blowing up
brainlet tier  mode7    man of intelligence tier  abusing scanlines to quickly draw a road    elder demigod tier  using scaled sprites to simulate depth    lord of multiverses tier  making different backgrounds for varying degrees of curved roads and toggling between them
  looks like a silky smooth shitty mario kart without karts or music
    its a cool demo but the genesis is going to need some of those cycles for sprites and gameplay logic maybe the sega cd could pull it off
  what did you think of the snes mode 7 at the time    very cool i had fzero and i thought it was a 3d game there was nothing else like it
its fine i dont get why people hate it so much i guess its because it was used as an advertising marketing thing but i think it adds to the visual experience and sometimes gameplay too
it was a gimmick for everything except racing/vehicle games     in your typical jrpg where they use it for the world map it just gets in the way like in secret of mana    problem is that most people think that mode 7 is the name for literally every special effect on snes that axelay roller pin effect is not mode 7
  at the time    i figure at the time most of us didnt know what that fuck mode 7 was and just thought it was a cool effect was pretty far from mindblowing or anything though to anyone who owned a computer
  was pretty far from mindblowing or anything though to anyone who owned a computer  you must be an emulator kiddy pcs couldnt do anything even close to mode 7 with 1990/1991 hardware
  please explain how exactly mode 7 is a gimmick     i am sure you believe that smk and fzero were worthwhile games you really think they could have been done without mode 7     give any other effect on any hardware that is not a gimmick     of course you have no explanation for it youre just a clueless zoomer going around hating on random shit to pretend that you know something better than others do/did and also to troll
  there was nothing else like it  this is what ignorant nintendildos really believe
  toy story/jurassic park fps sections although not sure if those were actually mode 7 or not      they are not mode 7 jurassic park fps 3d is a software driven raycaster engine that was created using the sness 256 colour mode pretty sure it was done the same way wolfenstein 3d on the snes was created toy story was coded to use vertical textured strops to create 3d walls the toy story sections actually ran at a faster framerate on the genesis/ mega drive too    great video from the programmer of toy story showing how it was all made    
  pcs were already doing full 3d when the nes was released much less the snes enjoy the half a dozen games that used the superfx chip babby
honestly none of the 3d features of the snes impressed me i already saw doom by this time  it was leagues ahead what consoles were doing      what did impress me about the snes were games that featured prerendered sprites that was a massive leap forward from 8bit and early16 bit gaming
i dont remember it was like 28 years ago
     actually i take that back  i was impressed with the 3d traps in yoshis island you know like when the wall collapses on you in the castle was this mode 7
  yoshis island was superfx 2
  pcs were already doing full 3d when the nes was released  yeah like what      i was impressed with the 3d traps in yoshis island you know like when the wall collapses on you in the castle was this mode 7  nope mode 7 is just the rotation or scaling of a entire background layer for example it cannot do perspective tricks by itself like the world map shit in final fantasy vi but can when combined with hdma    those wall collapsing parts in yoshis island are either a canned animation pulled from the rom or polygonal shit which the superfx chip was responsible for
  i wouldve prefered sprite scaling          you should be banned from this board
  despite playing and enjoying the games i wasnt aware of its existence i was just a kid
  this game looked so cool in the arcades until you played it and couldnt figure out where the roads were going    
  remember the tazmanian devil game for the snes
good for shit like fzero  stupid for shit like that one level in castlevania 4
  my arcade had a cabinet with a car you could sit in that would swing left to right with the turns in the game  it had a seat belt and everything
i generally did not like this effect as it was super pixelated    however a few games made good use out of it namely the super star wars just used it as a ground texture     i never knew what it was actually called until later finding out that nintendo basically pushed developers to include this whether it fit or not explains why it usually looks bad
  this
i still think super mario kart snes is one of the best looking games and none of the other full 3d versions has ever lived up to it
  come on dude just enjoy the games lets not turn this into a weird middle school fixation on trying to prove you are mature because of the toys you play with
  oh god thats just awful
  confirmed not born when the nes was release
  whats it like being homo
  sega cd had hardware for sprite scaling and mode 7 look at soulstar and the racing portions of that batman game forgot which
impressive for the time because not even all arcade games had 60 fps 3d but once you see a few games you realize its pretty limited i even thought super hang on  on genesis was really impressive when i saw on demo in a store
i dont think mode7 is very interesting some of the effects pulled off in panorama cotton look far more impressive
  i always found this game to be very impressive for the mega drive it came out in 1990 as well    
  i completely agree just look at this    nowthe actual track was messy being a sloppy jagged rotation but the style is unmatched my ideal game is 3d with handdrawn characters just draw 40 angles fuck character models
  the music too im hearing it in my head right now
  it was this moment i knew i needed a snes
  i rented this game explicitly for its 3dish mode 7 graphics on the package 
  this game i mean
  i fucking love mode 7 still do
  sega cd had hardware for sprite scaling and mode 7 look at soulstar and the racing portions of that batman game forgot which    there are two batman games on the sega cd/ mega cd that use the systems hardware scaling sprites both are driving games the first one is batman returns which was based on the 1992 movie this was actually a port of the genesis game but adds additional driving levels and a cd soundtrack          there is also the adventures of batman and robin which was based on the cartoon series this one was nothing but driving it also contained original animation from wb         both of these games use the same engine and they do show the impressive scaling abilities of the sega cd it is well above what the snes can do     there are also games like soul star       battlecorps       thunderhawk       that all showcase the scaling capabilities really well though one small issue with the sega cd sprite scaling is that it was generally capped at 20fps because of the bandwidth limitations of the sega cd to sega genesis/ mega drive interface but then again most of the sega super scaler arcade games ran at 30fps anyway so 20 was not too bad all things considering     another example is silpheed which uses polygons for the player ship and enemies as well as hardware scaling along with prerendered fmv backdrops     
i remember the empire strikes back snes game had a mode 7 level where you flew a speeder and used tow cables to bring down atat walkers i thought it was fun and a nice change of pace but i imagine there were some players who just wanted a run and gun and found it annoying
  all the super star wars games have stages like that they look and play pretty good at least as good as the snes can handle a scaling shooter
whats the closest real life equivalent to this game maybe some verbose 80s text game
  any bioware game post me2
should i play it
i bought this 7 years ago and still never taken the disc out of its case i think i just wanted something good to put on my saturn shelf
  being this shitty at your hobby
  is this one of these weird antiskill threads where we all pretend that video games are serious business and think people somehow have deep emotional investments in being good at them
  yes
    thanks for saving me clicking the link sorry i dont want to be a gatekeeper for how someone else plays with a toy
  hes playing on mame so even if he managed to play it well it wouldnt count
  we dont want to to watch your video
tmnts a garbage game cant blame anyone for only wanting to play it casually desu
  actually caring enough about somebody elses casual mediocre playing to post about it on 4chan
people who say they dont notice any input lag in emulators should emulate pic related
use mednafen
  that game has input lag on console the rhythm is just really weirdly specific
git gud
hated this game 6yo me thought it was gay af and really a nongame  is it worth getting back to it 20 years later
  this it is just off in general even on a crt
  its actually pretty fun        a tip for anyone playing this or um jammer lammy dont push the input where it is on the screen ddr and modern games guitar hero want you to press the input exactly when the bar goes by on the screen parappa actually is usually a bit after the input graphic listen to the music and you will do way better than trying to blindly press the input when it says just think of the input as a cheat sheet to see what youre going to push but let your ears determine the timing    in other words if you press x exactly when it matches the on screen prompt you will be early if you press it half a second late to the musical beat it will be perfect
     dont do it if you didnt like it     vib ribbon was the best game this dev released
who was your first /vr/ crush
i didnt play mega man as a child    so i only like roll now as a grown man

  implying he cant have both
  he actually cant having both would entail pedophilia

  kid link from oot was my first crush as a 7 year old kid it was something about playing that game when i was bored all the time and the cute boy hero that got me
  yiff in hell furfag
  correct answer
  both elles nah how do you choose anon
since a nintendo mag put megaman 64 at the cover
and thus a lifelong infatuation with huge titted ninja was born
unironically lara croft
  unironically    im getting sick of people using this word the wrong way
  well considering how /vr/ seems to hate her
    still not how to use the word
  saria is ageless though
i mostly knew her from the anime since nearly all the medarot games are only in japanese but she counts
  this
  my brother
    not tron bonne
  good choice
  what game is this
    marin a qt 314
  jersey devil for ps1
  she had a codpiece bolted to her crotch youre not gonna get far with her

  its actually a buckle on her undershirt its shown on some piece of concept art
i cried when she died
cuck shit nigger poopy fuck
  hibana from nightshade

loved her as a kid
    i used to hate lefthanded people so i never liked her as a kid but now that im not such a retard i like her kek
nina from tekken 2
misty
  the first would have been chunli right around the time i got my first erection then i quickly jumped ot lara croft
  i used to hate lefthanded people  why i always thought lefthanded people were cool im righthanded myself but i always kind of wished i could be lefthanded
  it sucks gotta do carpal tunnelinducing wrist contortions to write properly
    mah boi    but i am pretty sure it was too anime misty so technically not /vr/ is it
let me be honest here
  all the ocarina girls are normie tier even her
chunners 4eva
for me it was selphie  ignore the cg book art
  my man
    her third strike sprite made me discover precum
check it out losers if you dont fap to this youre not even fapping  
definitely my first vg crush even though shes a healer and wouldnt do much atk dmg i would always have her a my main healer/mage her limit breaks were cute though
f e l i c i a
  wasnt she dubbed with a guys voice or something in the anime i remember thinking she was a guy for a few episodes because i couldnt hear her correctly and the design is very boy like
step aside anime twerps  good luck  commander
  wasnt she dubbed with a guys voice or something in the anime  nah it was just a bit scratchy and i first heard her in the swedish dub which is similar but not as scratchy i only rewatch the subbed version nowadays though  and the design is very boy like  yeah she is a tomboy just like a lot of other great anime girls    i still like her by the way best girl
regina
primm som
  that game was way too depressing it had so much potential too
  shake it baby
  it was a masterpiece and i strongly recommend generation 2
  same
  i havent given up on finding a girl that looks like quistis to marry even though im old enough to mow lawns and drink monster now
as far as vidya it was terra
  mail order brides from the former east bloc
  which eastern bloc country i really would if she actually looked like her
  your best bet is ukraine thanks to the ongoing conflict plenty of pretty blondes are seeking an escape
oot zelda
  lisa from persona 2
  friend of mine used to read porn fanfiction of her and link on gray archives  shit was weird still friends with him too
  tfw no spunky young elf gf
cut my life into pieces
i dont think i had a video game crush but i can definitely see child me falling fucking hard for soltia if i had a saturn growing up
this cunt
  please dont judge me
  i always hated her
    celes
  dark one actually but this is the only sprite image i found e
  judges
ywn be haunted by a qt chubby ghost lady with excellent balancing skills
  quistisfag here i liked her too until i was turned off by her thing for locke    also her bondage scene was probably my first why is this allowed moment in gaming
  she looks amazing in the remaster
  locke is my favorite ff character so the dynamic between the two of them in the game ended up making me fond of her too    and yeah knowing how fierce nintendo was about censorship and all on their consoles back then im surprised that scene was allowed
2nd place
  excellent taste anon    pretty sure the generic valkyrie unit from ogre battle was mine
the one and the only
  not waifuing jessie    pleb
    honestly are her genitalia exposed
  its not because she has fur dummy
kat is hot as fuck too bad her game sucks and she will never ever appear in another game again
  she will never ever appear in another game again  this is really saddening because i miss her so much her game isnt really bad but no one wants to play an oldass jrpg with high random encounters rate from a series where the modern state of developers dont care anymore so she doesnt really become more popular as those red flags prevent it
    quit bitching and give muff
i never really caught the waifu bug but the closest i ever came was her   or ann from harvest moon
  some sort of police shoot em up or a russian spy game
tomb raider iii credits is what pushed me over the edge into trying this jacking off thingit had a still of lara kneeling naked covered by a pillow
as a child i always wanted to kiss roll not retro but my first romantic video waifu was bloodrayne
my first sf main wheni was a kid
    use meg
  did anyone else go into buildexe and make a warehouse full of strippers with different colored outfits for fapping purposes
  why do that when you could do the same thing with the alien captured tentacle babes
  came here to post this close runner up is lani from ffix
  oh fuck where is this lovely from
real actual irene from ninja gaiden    the whore one from the newer games can fuck off
  oh its just the plump villager from zelda 2 but drawn as deliciously as possible by kaigetsudo
prove me wrong
its pretty strong yeah there are a couple i personally like better but im not gonna say youre outright wrong
its good but i preferred pic related
  not playing the stargate version  bandwagon jumper
  ive always had a particular fondness for dragonfire although dragonstomper and escape from the mindmaster probably would hold the most interest for todays audience
  i cant in good conscience recommend dragonfire when the colecovision version walks all over it
  im a spiderman and yars revenge man myself
you could have called this game bird vs camel and no one would have argued with you
    best 2600 game coming through
  damn you got me    my parents didnt buy it for me til xmas 85 
the 2600 game which really blew my mind was tomcat but you rich kids had probably moved on to 3rd gen by the time it came out    
  no fucking way thats running on a 2600    jesus thats insane
  enduro is my favorite also star raiders is really fun i like using the multimedia remote      theres a space shuttle simulator too that uses all of the switches on the console for controls
    just bought this the other day it was also the first atari 2600 game i ever played  it was years ago in a friends basement    its very simple the the physics of the game hold up really well
  i guess it wins the best turd in the catbox award yeah
    its fun to talk about the lesser known games on atari but really the most famous games tend to be the best pitfall joust etc
  fucking incredible makes me want to rebuy a 2600 just to play it    for me warlords is a topshelf multiplayer game cant go wrong with a round of warlords
  i own two sets of paddles and ive yet to get to play warlords 4 player its sad
  still cant figure out the gameplay on this game    damn impressive for a 2600 title though
  its a good one but moon patrol is better
  is it wrong that i like the 2600 port of the arcade game just a tad bit better
  could go to a con one with older stuff older tabletops older games would probably be able to supply three willing players    i got the atari ultimate collection vol 2 on ds along with the first volume but the second one specifically for its 4player singlecard warlords i carry it along with a few other choice singlecard games in case i am going somewhere with ds players guaranteed fun
exemulation support group post your horror stories related to emulation and how it has affected your life pic related
post your horror stories related to emulation  i emulated clock tower nearly shat my pants    and how it has affected your life  clock tower is now my favorite game
  post your horror stories related to emulation and how it has affected your life  emulation redpilled me into not paying good money for vintage plastique from ebay maybe just an everdrive and my favorite console the horror
i once purchased a 599 cd blank to burn my roms onto
it ruined my marriage and i lost my job
but i still love metal slug heavy machinegun
  emulation made me realize that for every company thats still around like bethesda or activision or nintendo etc who regularly have 9 figure budgets on games and still have the nerve to complain about their own customers stealing from them and how they have trouble paying their bills for each of those companies there are 1000 games made by noname developers that tried their hardest and got no fame or fortune or anything    they are the people who spent what meager budget they had wisely and the game still ended up being shit the people who still dont get paid anything despite physical copies of their games being worth thousands of dollars on ebay now due to scarcity the people who had the nerve to try out some weird idea that for whatever reason never caught on
anyone got a link to that
but seriously neo geo collecting destroys lives and minds youre better off developing a meth habit or getting into gay prostitution
  i started emulating about 15 years ago but back then even snes ran shitty on anything that wasnt a powerhouse but it was still worth it     the intermediate years were up and down as i ditched some systems abd hoarded others when the prospects of passable saturn emulation threatened to be doomed forever     but gloriously breakthroughs were made and i was finally able to emulate even it and i could long last have a 100 crt free house
  100 crt free house  let me guess the wifes son prefers lcd /bait
  you definitely didnt emulate 15 years ago if you had issues emulating snes that is some made up fantasy shit right here people    an athlon xp could demolish snes at 2x resolution with filters with a mid grade 9xxx ati gpu
  15 years ago  that was about 1992 right    youre right 1214 years ago you could have emulated snes on a psp with no problems you could emulate snes all day long in 2003 with any toaster around even if you still had a w98 computer like i did
  ehh i still remember sd3 running like ass when i first tried playing it and that was probably not much before 2003 it was in the 00s at least there was some embellishment i am just making fun of this thread after all
  the psp actually does a far worse job than any 2003 pc ever did but it was also mobile hardware back when we didnt have a majority of our focus on mobile hardware
  oh im not arguing that im just saying it was even possible on a psp meaning computers of the time had no problem at all
  expecting literally anyone to read that monstrosity of a capslock mess    post your horror stories related to emulation  i emulate armored core and ace combat my two favorite ps2 series regularly and its very fun i enjoy the higher screen resolution a lot playing ace combat with a hotas is great too    post your horror stories related to emulation  i am now better at armored core and ace combat emulation got me interested in hacking/modding ps2 games specifically armored core emulation helps test changes quickly due to how fast it is to load up an iso file i got knee deep in a hex editor and learned all sort of things about programming and computers things like strings ints floats their lengths data formats ps2 technical information etc it got me interested in programming to help make hacking armored core a little easier even though many of these programs didnt come to fruition i didnt stop programming though and later programmed things unrelated to modding games the result is that i enjoy my favorite games even more having learned how they work internally and i have become a better user of computers emulation has made me a better person and inspired me to expand my horizons    if youre one of those muh original hardware people good on you i can see the joy in collecting that stuff and the nostalgia that comes with it but dont demonize emulation just because i want more control over how i enjoy my software
emulation lacks soul it can never recreate the true 90s gamer vibe its like masturbation vs sex with the real thing
  i think the soul is how much of your own soul you wanna invest in it i enjoyed games i could never play the proper way because eurofag on emulation as much as i enjoyed the actual carts on the real consoles    i am one of those guys that think the game itself is the important part though so feel free to disagree
  the dreamcast default date is 20 years behind to the day 11/27/1998
  its like masturbation vs sex with the real thing    your example would be truer if it were paying a prostitute to have sex or masturbating both will get you off one might be better but it costs a shit ton more    of course this example is for people who werent alive back in /vr/ times and didnt buy games when they were cheap im lucky that i didnt miss the boat and grew up then but in the last couple years there have been a few games i had to rebuy or ones i missed and it felt as dirty as id imagine it would paying a prostitute for sex
  some people cant separate the software offers as an experience and the experience of shopping hardware yes they are related yes its not same global experience playing the game without having bought the hardware or carts playing it on tv set however the software/code like it or not standouts by itself and can be delivered in different ways
emulate everything for years  fall for the hardware meme spend a ton of money on consoles and flash carts and expensive pvms  eventually realize this isnt actually any better than emulating  go back to emulation
  who was that
  not him but me
david perez posted that 17 years agoi wonder where he is now
  2001    nigga how in the fuck do you have a neogeocom screenshot that old
  are you saying you dont
wow that person has some kind of anxiety disorder im guessing
  emulation made me bad at video games because i spent the early 2000s heavily abusing savestates in zsnes instead of getting good like i had to on actual consoles
  lucky for you flash carts have save states
  horror stories  once upon a time there was a board on 4chan where adults came to talk about their old toys  then a bunch of redditots came along and started talking about emulation  so the whole place went to shit and no one lived happily ever after  the end
been emulating since late 90s i am 25 years old and i dont regret it games are expensive on brazil
  old people dont emulate
  all your old shit will die one day emulation is the only path towards immortalizing video games unless you want to rebuild everything in a new engine rare but its happened a few times like with daggerfal
   2001   real hardware is better than emulation   written by some shit posting noname on some shittier forum  thanks for giving us all fucking cancer op    indeed anon same
  on brazil  i think you mean in brazil
  bitch stfu u and i are next to each other on my iphone keyboard stop hating u broke ass nigga we all know that it was supposed to be in brazil u fuckin tryhard lame ass old loser
  wait wtf this actually happened to somebody
  sorry i meant  o and i
  hahaha thats right gotta work on my broken english    funny thing is that ive played pokemon on an emulator before i got my own gameboy and that was my first exposure to english unironically it helped me a lot to learn something
  youre doing fine man i guarantee your english is way the fuck better than his portuguese will ever be
  literally had an emachine celeron that was a christmas gift to the family in 1999 that couldnt run max payne 1 at a and i was able to play snes games just fine on it with emulators 15 years ago what were you trying to emulate them on
  talking about something is the same as doing it  talking about is the same as incessantly shitposting      i have shit older than you that will be working just fine after you die the first star trek replicator capable of accurately reproducing a vcs will die long before the last real vcs does but keep telling yourself that being a poor emufag is a noble cause
  technically were all on our country instead of in it because we live on the surface of the land instead of underground
  happens to everyone when they grow up kiddo
  no one cares m8
  criticizes someone for shitposting while shitposting
  so what im allowed to emulate just never mention it in case it wounds your delicate sensibilities you poor baby
i emulated the psone port of diablo one
emulation is like a gateway drug to real gaming  you start out small using savestates and cheats and before you know it youre neckdeep in modded consoles and piles of plastic trying to get imported euro carts to run properly through your framemeister  its really sick what happens to you people
  trying to get imported euro carts to run properly through your framemeister  once you buy a framemeister the disease is terminal and its time to kys
  about 15 years ago but back then even snes ran shitty on anything that wasnt a powerhouse  im gonna go with bullshit for 500 alex  snes9x ran perfectly fine on my families budget storebought emachines pc back in 2001
memes aside is this game any good
its a genredefining beatemup or bemup as theyre known among gamers
  i thought it was a tmntvania
its decent has good graphics and music but its hard as balls everyone memes about how hard the turbo tunnel is but as far as this game goes the turbo tunnel is easy ive gotten up to the snake pit level and after that i was just like fuck this this is way too hard anyone who beats this deserves a round of applause
its a good single player game
  the slappaknees call them bolt skrillaz
    always considered it more of a scotformer
best pause music ever    get good at juggling birds in the wookie hole and youll do well
  it revolutionized the sidescrolling conflict amphibian genre
  you mean beltscroller
  man it sucks charlie browning the bomb in rat race
the peak of battletoads is the arcade game
  took me about two weeks of grinding to finish this game but once its done you can pretty much beat it every time its really good one of the best on the nes because it throws multiple fun gameplay concepts at you and forces you to master them all or you wont get to progress
  not enough formin so id consoder it a scotscroller
  you mean a depthy detractor dispatcher
  as long as we agree scot was involved
  play the genesis version its looks and sounds better all around
  i prefer the snes or genesis versions of battletoads/double dragon in that its much more focused on the beatemup gameplay rather than the more eclectic mix of styles that the first game had that and the music is even better    theres definitely a different kind of charm to the first game though    nah
  its fun with a friend for an hour until you get to the hard levels that eat lives and you dont feel like playing anymore
its a tourdeforce of nes action platforming the amount of variety and novel mechanics is staggering very deliberately designed and requires near perfection at times its barely a beat em up and those parts are the most dull anyways
  yeah its tough but you can get through it with hard work and dedication
  its belt bmup you faggot
  its a tourdeforce  sup 90s game journo
  this guy gets it
  its french for tour of force you ignoramus
  no its a mishmash of minigames and half of them dont work correctly the later games are much better balanced
  no shit you fucking faggot  t never read a 90s video game preview
  its only a beat em up if you never make it past the first level
  find out urself
what did he mean by this
last blade 2 is snks greatest fighter  i wish more people played on fightcade
  based and redpilled
the samurai knew before anyone that the jew was going to destroy the world
  the jews fear the samurai
    i wish it was true
  i played it once there were few guys playing i even played two guys expected to get ass kicked but destroyed them with moriya teleport glitch but than a singaporean player game who was on a different level nicely beat all the ego out of me with speed lee  what do you play senpai i play speed moriya but am spending time with power lee and power setsuna i also tried amano but hes kinda hard since his main combo cancelling lunge into super i can only do on left side because of keyboard and fightcade emulator but on shmupmame i can easily do it  also final boss is a bitch
