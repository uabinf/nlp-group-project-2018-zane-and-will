its true im one of her gfs
  thanks
its a deal
try to post on /int/  rangebanned  unban me how hiro or ill send emus to your house
oh jesus no not the emus  hiro please think of your shrubbery
is the advice board broken    it wont show any images for me and my adblocker goes fucking nuts reporting a ton of blocked items when usually theres only 1    ive tested a dozen other boards and none of them are behaving like this
  there are three threads exactly like this in the /qa/ archive        hope those help
  thanks buddy    now this is a bird thread
shirts you would buy
is the russians on 4chan thing just a meme
nope theres actually russian bots that try to convince people to like trump
absolutely and if there are its mostly on /pol/
im genuinely fucking sick of our board being spammed with up to 6 generals at once which arent even related to music theyre just trashy fap threads that belong in /b/
when are we going to answer the kpop question                   
  upboated  take it to irc plz
  bump
  you would think those kpopfags would have a discord by now considering they use those threads like a chatroom
but if mods ban that general /mu/ will be flooded by the kpop trash thats the reason why they decided to make a general to maintain their garbage there
  4chan is already flooded with kpop trash outside of their containment gas em all
shiftclick you autistic fragile child
  you better shut the fuck up asshole or im going to skewer your asshole with my wee wee you fucking shit im going to make another /kpop/ thread right now on /mu/ out of spite
stan loona
  missing out /trash/ wjsn general

  they have several each with about 30 homosexuals erping with each other and coordinating their daily 4channel raids

  sorry we made one of your dozens of shitty 6ix9ine/kanye/fantano threads disappear    also stream solo 
/kpg/ posters are good people they stay in their threads and dont shit up other threads   sometimes they open a couple of threads too many but outside of that its no problem   the only reason you see so many /kpg/ at the same time is that the rest of /mu/ is so slow
  we just make a new thread at bump limit not our fault the rest of the board is so fucking slow
  based tofu post
  you forgot /wsg/  koreaboos were the predecessors to tiktokfags
both /mu/ and /jp/ suffer from being heavily parasitized by kpop/jpop idol shit which generally are the worst threads on the site    they pretty much surrendered their right to be treated like anyone else when their threads have been straight up spam and image dumps for fucking years subhumans if there ever were any they dont even seem sentient and have this obsession they dont even verbalize    put those fuckers in a room together maybe just exile all of them to /trash/ and lock the door youd expect a nasty fight but all theyd probably do is continue to act like nothing happened and make blank posts at each other all day or more realistically mods could talk for once and tell kpoop gen to produce real discussion or else risk action being taken for the years of spam
  its because you spam them with bot posts instead of getting a life and make new ones just to stay at the top when bump limit is reached
  youre not supposed to make a new thread when you hit bump dolt you make a new thread when it hits page 9 or 10 like a normal person
    fuck you virgin same excuse every time youll be gone soon
what is it with 13 year olds on the containment boards known as mu and bant being so butthurt your boards are dead so the only threads with activity  namely the kpop threads  rise to the top thats how this website that you stumbled upon a year ago and which youre crying on right now works deal with it
nobody likes korea
ban them
look at the posts itt and tell me they arent bots  
  agreed
  wow yeah thats bad
  holy shit you guys have a problem  will keep bumped
  /metal/  fuck off neckbeard
  frogs  shitty rap  beatles  shitty metal  grimes the gremlin  mukpg is the only thing keeping the board afloat
kpg here we do not spam any other threads in mu think about it how nice is that the whole fucking /mu/ could easily be rendered useless if we so desired and started shitting every thread but it so happens we are actually nice anons who are genuinely mostly interested in our own thread and talking to each other about our waifus and shit i mean whats so wrong with that
  gremlin  not your fake korean freaks you keep folders of like the real pedos you are
  /int/ solved this problem by requiring all general threads to wait for bumplimitpage 8 before posting a new one i expect this would also be a killing blow to the image spam they rely on
  defending the gremlin      i didnt know that was policy on /int/ is it really enforced its been a while since i participated in any general there but just looking at it right now theres /brit/ with three threads up at the moment
  the perfidious anglo has learned jannys active hours in a couple hours itll be enforced again
why is this allowed
    look at this shit look at this fucking shit    the same goddamn images posted   t h o u s a n d s   of times    some fucking autist has posted the same kpop image over 2000 times
  nah they keep to themselves we really need to ban all tenashi56 threads though
  thats all literally one guy though dont judge us all because of him please
  several general threads of the same topic/kind  do kpopfags dont know what a general is
  why are dead boards allowed
  there is nothing wrong with slowpaced discussion you scumcunt
2468320 2468329 2468330 2468335 2468345 2468352 2468353 2469279  yikes
  discussion  thats a good one
ban it
  you render it useless by forcing threads into the archive through posting over 8 generals at once i dont think you should be banned but at least limited why do your generals fill up so fast exactly
  they think they have to constantly spam every random little thought that comes into there heads every minute its almost bizarre    that and they have this weird obsession with pics you should see when a thread reaches image limit they all start crying like babies for a new thread immediately even if theyre 50100 posts away from bump limit
  post on imageboard  wonder why images are being posted
  holy shit
  no i meant theyll just post pics to post them theres no sustenance or any form of discussion to the posts themselves
  but theres no discussion or words at all its like a tumblr timeline as soon as a thread starts people just flood in hundreds of photos until it archives
  maybe they are too busy fapping to type words
  kpop fags topped /brit/ being the most retarded posters
  i wonder if they have scripts
stream fake love
they need to be removed for sure
  stream a fucking workout tutorial
this is now a tarkus thread
  just camed a brappis cum a shit benisman most likely

  fucking this why does the shitty pop music of a equally shitty cunt deserve to be that relevant for fucks sake there are a billion image boards out there why cant they just go to those sites instead of turning /mu/ into /kpop/
i honestly only come to 4chan to witness pathological behavior
just make a /celeb/ containment board and let kpop spammers duke it out with /v/ eceleb spammers /tv/ underage actress spammers and all the other normie fucks who decided to come to fucking 4chan to talk about popular people doing popular things
if all of you werent newfags youd know that moot endorsed kpop but everyone knows /mu/ is populated mainly by underageb so its really not surprising
i used to love kpop generals but after choabros got banned it went to shit
  moot has no power here
  moot is dead  and no one cares  if hiro cares  ill kill /kpg/
  bump
keep us floating boys mods will see us eventually
  good people  not even talking about music  smh nibba damn in /mu ur like jews in germany preww2 nobody likes u outside of ur shitty cults
  this has to be one of the best suggestions imagince the shitstorm in a board like that   10/5 stars would lurk there
  taking in the account on how hiro is driving the site towards i wouldnt be surprise he already has the vtuber starting up  tfw you will soon see jewtubers ending their videos telling you to come and post in my thread on /celeb/ 4channel
  based
so it appears the kpopfags decided to make two separate threads and are trying to convince /mu/ to have two  the cancer is growing
  lmao there are actually two          and /mu/ continues to have no moderation
  based smashing pumpkins breaking up the filth
get banned you sick fucks
kpop yeah im thinking its slavery
  yes weve known kpop is a fucking cancer but we havent been able to get rid of it for years    theres a fucking kpop general on every random board except for /b/    one day we will make a /celeb/ board and banish all the tiktok/kpop/celebritystalkers faggots forever
  one day we will make a /celeb/ board  that day will be soon
we demand a solution
stay mad cucks    if you care so much write some extensive text about how kpop is triggering you and submit it to the feedback page so that it can be deleted right away
kpop more like kstop
  explain the mods and managers who have posted on /qa/ then
bump i too am very fucking fed up with these fags they do not discuss music nor anything at all they mostly just spam the same webms/images over and over again until the bump limit is reached rinse and repeat please mods give them their own containment board
mods are too busy trying to monetize this site instead of purging the cancer that is kpop with righteous fire
frogposters are flooding again dont let this baby archive
dont let frogposters and /jp/tards distract you from the fact that /qa/ is a meta board and this is important

not funny but two days ago i stumbled upon some dudes personal page about guis he still updates it but i dont think the layout changed much since 2001  
remember acts of gord would that be considered reddit now
  for doing the jobs that nobody wants to
  no matter what it is someone would shit on it
  everything becomes considered reddit in time
    a site for faqs
  for faqs regularly posted to usenet newsgroups
  not sure how old it is though basically the internet history or something       shame its only in wbm now
  interesting also welcome

  was it considered digg then  i hadnt seen it before or if i had i forgot it it was funny
  i found this the other day while looking for an iso of the hooters racing game and havent been able to stop thinking about it the last update was this morning but it looks like the design has stayed the same since the day it went up      one of the few english language action quake 2 fansites still around a nice monument to mod culture of old      bunch of screenshots of old websites pretty interesting to see how many things came and went in such a short period      0037s history of 4chan wiki seems to be down again but wayback has it    i have a bunch more lying around somewhere but i dont remember where heres an old wallpaper for consolation

  /a/ ezine never ever
  pedobear is still extant by means of this one particular variation
  i remember showing all my friends that
  spurdo is such a huge alteration to pedobear in terms of visuals and what they represent you cant call them the same meme
  we kinda did the same to kuma beat    in a way pedobeats evolution was one of radical changes
  i guess but its kind of nice to know it had noteworthy origins
  pedobears evolution was one of radical changes  im rather thankful that this is case as opposed to the alternative all the variants of wojak are for the most part visually the same in terms of shape just with some variation in color and emotion eg wojak is mad deponent calm a brainlet ect  kuma on the other hand stared off as sjis art without any specific meaning and evolved into a pedophile a stereotype of a finnish teenage subculture and a silent and passive observer and the image evolved into something truly distinct every time
  fuck i remember that thread on /sp/
fukkireta
  
  how are these that old already  
  cool tried it on /qa/ but i think the antihotlinking measures broke the thumbnails
homestarrunnercom
  havent been there in a while
what does who /something/ here mean im an esl but it seems its not a legit grammar construction more like a meme and i dont see it outside of 4chan
who /esl/ here
fuck off lamemord  lurk ffs
  ive been here for years and seen it almost every day i understand theres just a skipped is/like verb by meaning i meant to say origin of such construction
    fuck off
who /notafaggotlikeop/ here
  its talking like ethnic minorities do
being esl is not an excuse honestly
  been here for years   still cant speak proper english  fucking how
  theres practically no proper english used here
mfw is my face is when i post on 4chan 4channel reddit the /qa/ spinoffs hardocp and somethingawful on the daily all the same without preferring any site to another in any substantial way  who else does this
  ayano says youre a traitorous faggot
i can do all that with an rss feed and have it scroll across the bottom of my screen without browsing anything
  only 141 more days
  tfw use the internet as a tool it was designed to be and dont buy into retarded internet culture or legislative shit
  this is me who also adapts to every site without permeating one sites style unto anothers
fucking fix pass on 4channel already your fucking imbred apes
everybody here has posted a picture of pepe once in their life
i only posted feelsgoodmanjpg  by the time people were trying to talk to me about rare pepes i knew it was old and overplayed
been here since 2001 never posted a frog
literally never posted ppe
  before it became one of the most creatively bankrupt shit memes on the site
cant use pass across 4chan and 4channel at the same time  what is this bullshit
  pick one faggot
paying to use 4chan  literal autism
  this has nothing to do with autism stop shoving that word in every sentence
  buy another pass goyim
i havent noticed this did you remember to allow the same domains to do the same things on 4channel as you did 4chan  15 minute cooldown before posting on blue boards  they should implement that globally by requiring old cookies then retards would have to learn to edit cookies or wait before crosssite shitposting slow the cancer down that much more

refute this
i cant this is true
cant be good morals if no one buys it
what evil behaviours are encouraged and what is the punishment for having good morals
  define evil and good
  cheating the system leads to long term economic damage which hampers buisnesses in the long run and eventually leads to depressions

evil behavior  good morals

  i like you
  purple is my favorite drink
  i like kagamin    
  lucky star s2 when
  never ever
  i remember when ls came out i was playing wow bc and my sister was watching it and i could hear it from her room and i used to hate it back then like all the other 4channers weird how japanese anime has protags as girls because desu theyre smarter than men
im not sure i ever actually hate anime or weird japanese stuff ever it just came naturally for me to like and enjoy it
  me on the right
i like konata because she is a otaku like me except she has friends oh god i wish i had friends too _    konata also likes videogames and she is kawaii and there are lesbians in the show and thats good because i like lesbians and i will never have a girlfriend why am i such a loser    konata is like my dreamgirl she has a 3 face i love that she is also nice why arent real girls nice i got dumped a lot of times but i love konata and she wouldnt dump me because shes so nice and cool    we would play videogames all day and watch naruto and other cool animes on tv and i would have sex with her because sex is so good i wish i could have sex with a girl
  reddit spacing
  4channers  cringe
  this site has gone to the fucking dogs
  i know normies and their passive aggressive made up stories are boring as hell i dont understand why they dont just kill themselves theyre just projecting at the end of the day
  why did you reply to it
  passive aggressive made up stories  are you talking about     lol
  thats what it really is though anything you say or do is in your own little world you cant speak for others you are only your own brain
  the paragraph youre talking about has been posted on 4chan verbatim approximately fifty thousand times starting from something like 2005
  thats what it really is though  maybe when it was originally posted in 2007 but by now its a decade old copypasta that any lucky star fan thats been on 4chan more than a year would recognize instantly
    sorry i didnt browse pussy blue boards like you 10 years ago when fox news was getting all the normies on 4chan
  so what were you doing at the time
  so youre defending anime but at the same time attacking /a/ oldfags
  fucking your mom and staying far away from scientology raid shitters
  jesus tittyfucking crack smoking christ on a moped why would you have this saved    seriosuly what kind of person seeks out downloads saves and reposts an image an animated image of a deer fucking a crying schoolgirl    like i know there are bizzare fetishes and weird shit that turns people on and you know im totally cool with that i just dont look at it but this fucking this    the fact that somebody thought it would be hilarious to save thisthing and then that everyone else wanted to see it jsut boggles my motherfucking mind what type of a persona re you seriously do you keep this shit to yourself or do you act like a creepy fuck in public too do you have any friends at all i sure as fuck hope not    and the worst part of all of this is that in about 30 posts this will morph into a lucky star porn thread with almost a hundred images of similar situations depicting children being horribly molested that nearly a hundred people all have saved to their hard drives to jack off over as the helpless little girl squirms in panic on their screen for their own enjoyment    just what the fuck i know this is how the internet works but what the fuck    too much what is this i dont even    inb4 capslock is cruise control for cool fuck off pedophiles i can press any damn key i please go rot in jail

  i want moot back
thanks japan
it couldnt last anyway  the influx after the 2016 elections ruined everything
  he isnt
  this hasnt been an anime website for a long while but youre still a fag if you cry about people posting anime images as reactions or offhandedly
  orange man bad
  who are you quoting
  wheres the lie
  this is an even dumber reply than this 
  ah yes the classic election boogeyman
  wow the replies just keep getting dumber huh
  what sort of critical analysis were you hoping for
  t redditor
  just not going down ridiculously unnecessary tangents as if theyre the only possible path
            hahahaha fucking retards
inb4 only pretending
  anon please dont tell me youve forged this image  this sort of fake news is really not acceptable in a tight woven community like /qa/
  if the replies seem flippant perhaps its because what hiro said should have been obvious to everyone who posts here
  no i mean look at this reply chain        
  i agree with the last poster that the 2016 election gets too much credit and that the first poster is wrong the third poster is just saying the same thing  did the second poster the npc poster is the only earnest shitposter in the situation
  well anyway my point is that theres a clear break between the first and second reply that the third reply the one to the second reply further entrenches an unnecessary tangent in this case details of the election or even further partisan matters
  well i can agree that the 2016 election should not have been brought up this wasnt an anime website for a long time before that if anything the 2012 and 2008 elections had more to do with it but certainly werent the main causes
  implying hes good
  i can see why youd think that but all i mean is the first post is an opinion but the second post is a tangent
benevolent  how has hiroshima been benevolent in the slightest
  look at all of the nice boards he has made since he came here
  i want moot back this jap is useless
  none of them have worked out in a beneficial manner /bant/ is only just mediocre the rest are worthless
  moot said basically the same
  reminder that anything moot says during the canvas era is mostly revised bullshit of his own creation he tried to reinvent himself as well as 4chan   he started this place as a porn dump where he and his edgy irc pals couldnt get banhammered so easily
  he said the same he always said too bad you werent around before archives so you wouldnt know
ughhhh
    who cares what that redditor said hes gone and hes not coming back
fake news  
  the perfectly formulated english sentence really should have given that away
  100000 platinum mad rn
  fake and gay but japs hate weeaboos so it could be
  implying moot still cared about anime after 2005

    op here i should also add i do that shit where i find someone and start searching for excuses to get them out of my life like im not good enough for them im a school drop out so its true and then i beg them to be my friend again just to do it again sometimes is because conversations online are kind of boring proof is that is was harder for me to cut relationships i also had in real life than with people online i just told to stop talking to me
whoaso this is the power of 4channel

  i hope this actually works out
  really like this idea  maybe ill see if i can acquire some modicum of drawing ability in the next few days
nothing lewd/explicit  whats the point
  christmas is a time of cheer not lust

  cant i just send people free stuff like manga  wheres the list where i can just send free stuff
maybe ill do this could be interesting but also more work than shopping pictures
bump
  i dont think there would be an issue with photoshopping together a christmas card for the other person i doubt everyone can draw or would be satisfied with what they produce as long as some effort is put in it should be fine
bump  two signups so far
this is a really great idea who is drawing them
i wanted breakfast  i wanted a sandwich  so i made it  so i made one  it had egg  it had cheese  all was good  all was right  until  i forgot it  i forgot one thing  the core  the bacon    my breakfast was ruined  my breakfast was terrible

  psycho rightwing capitalist fascist industrial death machine  all these buzzwords  prove it
  defend americas healthcare system i want to see you try
and say yes to white nationalist fascism
goddamnit leftypol you have a whole board for this shit on your spinoff
i said it before and ill say it again say no to capitalism and communism both are devoid of humanity and miss the mark by a hundred miles materialists are living in the dark ages the bad kind
  this but unironically
can you please just fuck off with your /pol/shit back to /pol/ or go die in a fire otherwise
/qa/
is there a board with a faster shrinking userbase than /mlp/
  why wouldnt this be the case they gave one cartoon a single board of course people will get bored of the show and move on that has to be the most retarded decision ever made its like giving the dark knight rises or neon genesis evangelion an entire board it just doesnt work    mlp is /co/ and its inevitable that  will be deleted gr15 will be deleted and my little pony posting will be moved to 
its still faster than /an/ /po/ and snorts /vip/
  /bant/
  that has to be the most retarded decision ever made  it was a containment board for ponyfags and it served its purpose  instead of being deleted the board should be merged into /mlpol/ again
  do you even remember what happened when there was no /mlp/ board and the brony thing just came into existence
  yeah i was actually actively posting a lot more back then people just used ponies as reaction images it was mainly /b/ imagine and /co/ who complained mods could have just banned people who overdid it for avatarfagging    some retards got triggered by ponies thats why the rule and the board exists
i did pic related and still had all the daily posting data  normalized the posting data for each board the day with the most posts  1 the day with the least posts  0  calculated the slope of the trendline that best fits the data using the slope function
and here is the data  /lgbt/ /wsg/ /cm/ /news/ and /adv/ are having a surge in popularity  /biz/ /wg/ /cgl/ /bant/ and /gd/ are declining
  for retards who understand slopes positive  board is getting more users and negative  board is losing users numbers closer to 0 like /asp/ and /aco/ still have about the same number of users
  4faggots
  /biz/ declining  i cant imagine why i dont think theres a board more shilled on the site
  /biz/ must be the lowest on the list because most of the cryptocurrencies are in the toilet right now
  for people who dont understand why /lgbt/ is surging in popularity this is definitely why    the maletofemale trans general dominates /lgbt/ and its not only full of tripfags but it has links to fucking reddit in their op want to know how bad the tripfaggotry is there    heres one of their recent threads it has 1083 posts and only 593 are anonymous
  current year is not 2013 nor 2012 nor any year prior nobody gives a shit about ponies aside from lee and even then hes lost a considerable amount of steam if you removed gr15 you might get some light flame wars for a week and then everybody will stop giving a shit
  why did jewt think was a good idea
the entire 4chan/4channel site is down in traffic look alexa ranking we dropped 200 ranks this year alone all the normalfags are leaving and i assume some good posters too
  those faggots also colonized /gif/ the porn is the same shit you find on reddit as are the posts somebody once posted a loli webm some time ago and the freakout was beyond belief they legitimately thought it was illegal and shit
  further data  /lgbt/ has had 1795203 posts this year and 1409372 are anonymous that gives /lgbt/ a 2149 tripfag/namefag population      so far in november /lgbt/ had 187716 posts and 141433 are anonymous that population now jumps to 2466  so theres your explanation redditors have invaded /lgbt/ and now make up onefourth of that board thats why /lgbt/ is more popular
  sorry forgot the other data    
  alexa rankings are determined by grandmothers unknowingly using the malware alexa toolbar and are not reliable in the slightest
  can you post the source of the data    /cm/ is becoming more popular  nice    because every time the price of bitcoin of etherum drops a good bunch of them kill themselves
  /qa/
  can you post the source of the data  hownuru
  russian hackers at it again
  boards like /cm/ and /news/ are too small and volatile to really see a trend  /lgbt/ and /wsg/ have really gone up quite a bit  wondered why then looked at the threads and it seems its because of tiktok
  this they keep shitting up trap threads with shemales despite already having their own thread
  theyve turned it into their personal porn dumping ground /gif/ is really just the nsfw extension for their fag board    plus they have have the exact same indignation in response to people disagreeing or expressing distaste   hurr just come out of the closet bro  why u posting in a thread you dont like that means you actually like dicks up your butt  just let people be gay bro who cares that we turned this board into fag and degeneracy central    literal redditors who colonized the board and basically took control of it successfully disgusting
  its like giving  neon genesis evangelion an entire board  good idea
    literal and figurative faggots christ i feel bad for the oldfags on that board
  /wsg/  this is probably the most normalfag board on the site prob even moreso than /b/ at its height
  now thats embarrassing
  thats because pewdiepie constantly browses /wsg/ on his videos his fans moved there
  true just didnt think theyd be smart enough to find their way just based on the layout
  no he was only ever on /gif/
  i thought /adv/ or /soc/ must be among the most normalfag boards in particular because everyones manner of speech sounds outsiderish
  that gives /lgbt/ a 2149 tripfag/namefag population    jesus christi figured it would be bad but that is just ridiculous fucking fags they never disappoint
  i think most people block out those two boards when thinking about the other boards just because of how awful and unlike anything else on the site they are
  the porn boards are the absolute worst in that regard granted you cant expect some high discourse from boards where everyones typing with one hand but still its just too much what in the world goes through someones head to reply to posts in a porn dump as if whoever posted the picture in question was that actual chick the kind of posting that goes on in threads on /s/ and /gif/ is on a whole different level  also the people who post their ugly fat girlfriends/wives and the slime that post pics from facebook deserve a public lashing too
  you never have this problem on the 2d porn boards simply because because 3d always guarantees the lowest of the low normalfaggotry finding its way in and normalfags byandlarge dont wanna touch 2d hentai because they think its weird tentacleshit or furshit and its a good thing they dont too
  it has 1083 posts and only 593 are anonymous  woah shit    that gives /lgbt/ a 2149 tripfag/namefag population  woah shit  we gotta backtrack when did the general start better yet at what point did tripfagging gain this much popularity
  also the people who post their ugly fat girlfriends/wives and the slime that post pics from facebook deserve a public lashing too  this is my biggest pet peeve on /s/
  it has nothing to do with being weird its fairly normal in this day and age its how it takes a special kind of retard to be attracted to drawings and that is why hentai isnt that popular with the rest of the site
  the first category is simply fascinating these people lack any kind of selfawareness but its expected from mouthbreathers who post ugly slobs on /s/ and reply to posts of ugly slobs with omegletier responses   the facebookposting and whatever other social media they get their pics from kind should be banned as a matter of principle      time to close the tab and go to whatever site you came from
    wew you guys werent kidding 
  post url pl0x 4channel broke clover
  time to close the tab and go to whatever site you came from  ive been here for 12 years and some odd months i never came here for 2d anything
average daily posts per board via 4statsio  /gif/  6268 posts  /s/  1749 posts  /hc/  412 posts  /hm/  382 posts  total posts daily 8811     /trash/  20926 posts  /aco/  2530 posts  /d/  1401 posts  /h/ 835 posts  /u/  718 posts  /y/  374 posts  /e/  297 posts  total posts daily 27081    that is why hentai isnt that popular with the rest of the site  where do you think you are normalfag
  4chan the home of /pol/ what year do you think this is 2004
    linking lole
  what year do you think this is 2004  no he gave you the stats for 2018
  4chan the home of /pol/  lole fuck off electionigger
all porn addicts are the same type of normalfags to me rotten people
  moralfags like you are why 2016 /pol/ was a mistake
  he left out that /a/ is the 6th fastest board now its having a good week being 5th right now and that the legacy anime boards have been static in population for a decade
  i have never visited /pol/ normalfag
  the election of 2008 was when the ron paul meme began on 4chan anon sorry you were too busy fapping to 2d to witness it
  you dont even realize modern /pol/ is hardly the same as pre2014 lole
  thats why i dont browse it anymore
  literal redditors who colonized the board and basically took control of it successfully disgusting  so we have /r/the_donald claiming one board and /r/the_tranald claiming another seems like a nature thing one type of cancer balances out another just purge both and be done with it
  me neither   gamergay and election filled it with too many redditors and unassimilating newfags lole
  4chan the home of /pol/  dont you mean 8gag or have you all moved to endchan now or back to stormfront
  the worst part is even if they did assimilate it would be nu/pol/s culture
  the meme magic shit and the frog god was the last straw for me  i only wanted happenings not epic srs bsns and gay ops
  tfw space elevator threads got replaced with flat earth threads
  youre not wrong election2012 and the zimzam era was peak /pol/ the blood moon tinfoilfaggotry and the rise of attention whores like milo and gavin and pjw was what made me leave
  what most worrying is how open nu/pol/ is toward embracing eceleb shit like mistermetokur ie internetaristocrat and other youtube shitheads
could someone do one of these graphs for s4s i would love to see how popular it has been over time
  i still cant understand how flat earthers even exist    like how can you even be that retarded while still being able to understand language
  here ya go  at this point /s4s/ is on its 3rd or 4th generation of users
  the prevailing theory is that its cia niggers or whomever are purposefully poisoning the well by posting that shit so that anything that actually is closer to the truth is drowned and assimilated into the bullshit as people associate them all the same    old /pol/ was good at recognizing this but now nu/pol/ takes it at face value or doesnt care fucking cia niggers
  prevailing theory is that its cia niggers  what a convenient explanation for literally any inconvenient observation
  we know that cia browse image boards its been proven what exactly theyre doing is uncertain but we know theyre among us
  very interesting it seems like it gradually decreased overall for most of the time but now it has roughly the same traffic now as it did in the first year    i wonder what changed the trend
/f/ is reclining
  its probably the same old psyop social experiment that theyve always done  considering the collective iq of nu/pol/ is just under 100 im just not surprised they keep bumping that shit
  tfw two more years until its dead for good    shine on you crazy diamond
  more like foreign intelligence services and the independent contractors they hire browse 4chan its important to be accurate     
  tfw used to browse /f/ extensively in 2013  tfw stopped around 2015  fuck i guess i wasnt the only one
4chan is finally coming out of the closet heh
  i wonder what changed the trend  /s4s/ crosspollenating between /qa/ and /bant/
so will mlp shit eventually be forced back to /co/
  where can i find those graphs
  lurkmoarnet
gr15 is roughly speaking a special case of gr3 it should be extended to include all off topic posts and not just pony related garbage
  /pol/ at the top  /po/ at the bottom  this pleases my autusm
  complaining about degeneracy on a porn board  get a load of this guy
  holy crap even posts against lgbt are from reddit 
bronies lol    why did they ever think it was a good idea    who would stay somewhere where everyone hates them they must really be out of options
  who would stay somewhere where everyone hates them  most of the people who use this site
  considering its part of /co/s userbase to which later a fraction of /b/tards joined its a mystery
  most people who use this site werent so obnoxious that a global rule and containment board was created just for them
  a fraction of /b/tards    /b/ was where bronyism was popularized
considering almost all of /mlp/ are little fanfic cyoa threads there isnt much of anything left comprising real discussion even out of that remaining sliver more like especially out of that remaining sliver because those are the stubborn fags sticking their fingers in their ears going lalalalala at the reality of the fandom/board    so basically nuking it would barely make a dent on the site besides maybe having a general on /trash/ or occasional thread on /co/     remove the board keep the rule adjusted to just /trash/ for a few years on course they wont even entertain such logic because there are several brony subhuman mods autistically holding up the board fact there are more brony mods not janitors mods than there are mods even for big boards such as /a/ and /tv/ if only you knew how bad things really are this also explains why so many issues around the site are handled so fucking poorly  these know it alls who actually know nothing the term is sciolist keep blundering its up to hiro or manager to fucking fix this shit but there is a snowballs chance in hell of that happening
  if all 30 something boards slower than /mlp/ arent getting axed /mlp/ isnt either
  fact there are more brony mods not janitors mods than there are mods even for big boards such as /a/ and /tv/ if only you knew how bad things really are    im not surprised what halfway normal people from 4chans glory days are still around most normal people spend more time on reddit now bronies are also super defensive about their image so im not surprised theyd worn their way into the staff you can often see their selective moderation at work
  i love that bronies measure their worth this way    i posted 40 pages of a sonic x fluttershy fic see im contributing and our fandom is very important    learn to selfworth
  yeah but none of those other boards were made as a pure last ditch containment     its like keeping around world war ii planes flying waiting for axis planes to show up they wont that fight was had eight years ago and theres no reason to keep an arcane artifact of a board from preboom 4chan around they dont even really use it for anything valid youd get banned in ten minutes trying to make a sex fanfic cyoa for smash bros or some shit on /v/ or /co/ yet its fine for tons of these to do as they please on /mlp/ theyre being outright rewarded for fucking terrible deviantart/livejournal tier behavior and sheltered from reality its useless time to put it down at the bare minimum their generation of show ends in what 2019 2020 that would be the absolute most logical time to wrap this up
  sonic deserves its own board honestly
  they should just make a deviantart board and put bronies furries and sonicfags on it
  i do it wasnt even bad
  they call it content notice they never claim it is good or needed it just exists because they have nothing better to do over there and nobody stopped them from getting ultra autistic about it
  yes they are narcissists more in love with the idea that they are content creatorstm than actually creating anything worth a damn
  and what is your idea of creating anything worth a damn what metric are you using to gauge and measure content quality compared to any other board or hell even fandom for that matter     you sound incredibly salty over nothing
  i dont know how about would anyone besides bronies have any interest in this
  and the same could be said of weebs by normies or any subculture board on this site yet you single out bronies as something specifically special    you present a non argument as anybody not interested in something could fall into your camp of not interested in thing no matter what it is
  and you sound incredibly defensive over nothing     all i can say is that as far as pastimes are concerned i respect jacking off or collecting roadkill for pelts as hobbies more than relentlessly writing sex fanfics / slashfics and taking it super seriously for years with established authorship so does practically anyone else with even the tiniest grain of dignity or expectations in their hearts
  he mentions weebs first    look i know you feel all fandom threatened about the popularity but you have to acknowledge you ingratiated yourselves on this site and thus cant expect to have as much clout as anime just deal with it    im not arguing with you im telling you how it is its not up for debate
  as far as pastimes are concerned i respect jacking off or collecting roadkill for pelts as hobbies more  well then you have pretty worthless opinion and an even more worthless authority on the matter    you also make very broad generalizations i have no clue what youre talking about when you claim anybody is taking lewd smut super seriously its no different than any other fanfiction or erotica on the net if you have a problem with that as an entire concept then fine thats ok but if youre singling out /mlp/ for that specifically well then youre a hypocrite    also /mlp/ has an artistic output that is probably  only rivaled by pokemon and touhou
  you also make very broad generalizations     this guy has a bug up his ass about the very notion of judgement nobody must ever judge him as any worse than any other group    id love to read some of the mlp fic hes written i bet its amazing
  i keep lurking but still no one mentions the site
  you guys wouldnt be there still doing this year round years later in maybe 100 canonized generals if you didnt collectively take this all deadserious you dont take it seriously it doesnt matter okay then can you be on board with wiping all the fanfic / middle schooler smut off the board no problem even if that annihilated 9 pages it doesnt matter after all right    time serves as a filter here with relentless regurgitated playground stories gradually turning off and straining out the more sensible minds until we are only left with the most deluded ones on the board drunk on hubris and blinded by entitlement borne in the form of mods telling refusal/ignorance to just stamp out those habits in the bud     my point wasnt that fapping or collecting roadkill is so good it is that fanfic is so bad that it is even lesser than these basal things its too fucking lame even for 4chan this isnt news this is something that was collectively known and accepted everywhere across 4chan as common knowledge and still is prior to /mlp/ going headlong into it around what late 2013 2014 note how no other board followed suit with /mlp/s route and nobody is any more receptive to spamming fanfics counting as a desirable thing as the board population diminished because twilicorn and the meme fandom bloat was fading some people took to desperate measures to force people to stick around mods didnt nip it in the bud and it took over basically the whole board like a lush lawn of crab grass as far as i know moot was just astoundingly ignorant of what was going on and some underhanded biased mods swept it under the table instead of perform the expected inherent 4chan instinct imagine that a mod or mods with not even the most basal 4chan sensibilities what a fantastical compound failure this all is what a shitshow years brewing
  they already have a permanent general on trash thats full of namefags and blogposting theres some magic browser extension that lets you put an invisible name/trip on your posts and the 6 of them just blabber on about inane drivel constantly
  you guys wouldnt be there still doing this year round years later in maybe 100 canonized generals if you didnt collectively take this all deadserious  thats just simply the natural result of being forced and pressurized into one location take any subculture that exists on the site right now apply a gr15 style rule and heavily enforce it and i guarantee youll end up with the exact same end result thats what happens where theres no freedom to move around people segregate and highly specific niches and habits begin to form    you dont take it seriously it doesnt matter okay then can you be on board with wiping all the fanfic / middle schooler smut off the board no problem even if that annihilated 9 pages it doesnt matter after all right  honestly i dont care for any of the cyoa threads which alone comprise like 30 maybe 40 of the board catalog all those branched off into so many specific turd generals because theyre forced into one place they should honestly be on /qst/ but oh gr15 exists    theres nothing wrong with writing lewd smut or even nonlewd stories within the context of discussions so i only half agree to your proposal    i wont argue with most of what else you said as i can somewhat agree with it but again i just want to point out that this is the natural result of being forced into a cage and pressurized by heat moderation     note how no other board followed suit with /mlp/s route and nobody is any more receptive to spamming fanfics counting as a desirable thing  see above also i want to ask why youre so specifically fixated on fanfictions in particular you dont talk about the artwork or any other type of endeavor made by the fandom    oh and   its too fucking lame even for 4chan  do you consider 4chan srs bznss by chance
  so is everybody other than weebs and maybe one other group supposed to just never make fanfics or fanart because its not important enough 4kids is srsbsns and you shouldnt be wasting your time here making drivel right
  no but you shouldnt expect people to respect you for shitting out reams and reams of trash
thats just simply the natural result of being forced and pressurized into one location    see how they can never take responsibility for anything even all the trash they put out is because the haters just wouldnt let them be free
one guy on /qa/ is all of mlp  no other group here ever shifts the blame to (((someone))) else
  dont even engage with him indirectly hes an idiot just making noise and youre entertaining him
  4chan isnt all that serious but this isnt about being serious its the conduct not the content the idea the standard or lack of thereof its about not acting like a board of nothing but fanfics seemingly made by horny 13 year olds passes as a fine thing and that nobody can/should criticize or ridicule the shit out of it ridicule of this farce doesnt happen nearly enough really but that comes with the territory of just being forgotten and actively shunned by the rest of the site     admission is the first step  /mlp/ freely stooped lower than any other blue board before it and remains there today this isnt really talked about or looked at much because lol bronies and that free pass is mistaken by people like you as acceptance it isnt really though as a meta thing it isnt you in particular i am calling out as youre just a happenstance result  a result of mod inaction why this all was allowed to happen is not your fault so much as mods either ignorance or intentional sheltering of that fanfic meta there have been a few scruffenings but that was just lipstick on a pig fact of the matter is the collective lack of standards of users and mods produced this you never see this kind of thing on /jp/ which was made under somewhat similar auspices as /mlp/  /mlp/ did this to itself the curtain will have to close sooner or later and being entrenched so hard on this path will only make it hurt that much more when it does
  why are you even here
  mods knew better than to try and fight with bronies    they knew letting bronies sink into the muck that they created would be the most fitting revenge
  but this isnt about being serious  its the conductthe standard  so are you saying that the conduct which is not about being serious has a standard what is that standard then and who arbitrated it you if youre trying to apply a standard of conduct that behaves above silliness then pretty much every board that isnt a dumping board falls flat and thats evidenced by the many meta threads talking about these issues frequently so in essence youre stating that /mlp/ doesnt measure up to your standard of conduct and subsequently doesnt belong on 4chan while simultaneously giving other boards who if applied to the same standard would fail get a pass am i reading this correctly     you keep mentioning fanfiction and you still have not answered my question about why you focus on that and nothing else     your second paragraphs while perhaps true only in the vaguest sense still only speaks of generalities of why you think its so bad please list some things besides bad fanfiction of what you think is bad about /mlp/ that doesnt apply to other boards     /jp/ is a broader board than /mlp/ it should be obvious that the more general the board the less room for specific niche topics and generals to develop if /jp/ was instead /2hu/ or something itd have a similarly limited scope as /mlp/ and likely develop the same way over time with generals and fanfiction
  kek
  wow resetera really is invading
  yeah wasnt saying anything to the contrary just that only a part of those who simply saw yet another opportunity to laugh at someone going nuclear with rage started watching the show
    fucking /pol/ was right about this bullshit were being raided by redditsetera
  redditsetera   youre trying too hard and youre also retarded the trip fags on /tttt/ just blogpost all day about their boring lives and help convince the migrant crossboarders to buy programming socks just like how every ideological board tries to convert the wanderers not only that but the trip fags have been increasing since long before re made its 2 threads about might maybe raiding a blue board and to top it off the majority of people on /tttt/ hate the hyperfaggot tranners that clog up the board with their shit instead of posting like normal people  all it took to figure that out is a few hours in the archive also weve fully derailed the thread by now  inb4 lul reasonable people
  also weve fully derailed the thread by now  its a thread about grown males liking tiny cartoon horses so not really
  the only embarrassing faggots are kpoopers shitting 4 fucking simultaneous boards
  you can keep whining but your dead board will just keep being dominated by one of the kpop generals also ts five boards
/mlp/ thread  no one posted ponies
  it was as bad as furries except it was more popular and people irl were bronies
  as long as the faggots stay in their containment board
  and people irl were bronies  and furfags are carefully hiding their fetish irl right
  you dont see them everywhere in the streets except in a few degenerate cities
browse /m2fg/ a couple weeks ago  someone keeps threatening to kill itself because its boyfriend broke up with it  people keep responding to it  all the while the boyfriend is posting in the same thread
  yet besides if it was possible to signal how much of a faggot they are without walking around in a literal fursuit theyd do it in a heartbeat
      seething
  u mad bro xd
  tripfags are literal faggots   lmao
  now its the size of your average 4chan cartoon fandom i fail to see the issue the initial boom wasnt meant to last  the whole board could be a big general easily
  saw some cool mlp desktops   thought i was being ironic lol  find out about the pedo pony shit about a month later  delete instantaneously   shudder when i think of how many people saw me with them  goddamnit
  declining  and theres two reasons for that webms and the fact that every day is dedicated to posting the exact same shit every week thats why i stopped going to /f/
  declining
  wheres /tv/
  only about 20 people on the whole site still care about gr15 and 10 of them are barneyfag the only reason i see /mlp/ not merging with /co/ by the 2020 reboot is tradition or the fact the board has too many generals      this board however was actually a waste and didnt need to be made
  my home 
  flash  two thousand fucking eighteen
yes the board of directors for advocacy organizations supporting so called renewable energy
  the name is stupid they said it was going to be 3 letters and asked for suggestions then they went with a 4 letter name   and its a stupid board /pol/ without the politics just the gay circlejerk discussions
also i dont lurk /pol/ much any more but i think they stopped moving threads to /bant/ and just started deleting them outright
  is it time to reintroduce trolling the fuck out of evageeks as a meme
  this board however was actually a waste and didnt need to be made  they wanted to neuter the influence of /pol/ and of course /bant/ was a failure and they went as far as to make 4channel
  /biz/ friend here the board is pretty much dead compared to even 6 months ago and a good 20 of the posts at any given time are offtopic/brap threads    ppd on /biz/ really strongly correlates with price of bitcoin as a lagging indicator would overlay it but im lazy
  pic too dark
  this much of a decrease in 6 years  sad
  no they still do it  
  /x/ when through something like that in 2010 but recovered when the schizos arrived      thats a stable pop
  how and why exactly is this allowed
  /lgbt/ is half /soc/ half homo mafia problem with /soc/ type communities is that it attracts a lot of retards and attentionwhores    lgbt is soon gonna look like /mu/ did during the height of ironic shitposting
  what in the world goes through someones head to reply to posts in a porn dump as if whoever posted the picture in question was that actual chick  porn communities attract the worst dregs of the internet a number of them are medically insane and the rest is severely socially retarded    that one schizo on the /aco/ edit threads is hilarious tho
  crazy shit first time i saw a bubble burst first hand
can anyone post /co/ and /his/s traffic      that 2015 is actually /f/s historic peak/f/ was a 10 people board more or less since zone xenon and c0da stopped posting for most of its history that board was a fraction of even its modern day userbase 0x40 hues and coming up with theweekend chinese porn takeo ishii and a bunch of other remixes that ended up in youtube were the main reasons why we grew so much    i remember when we hit 200 posts for one thread on /f/ nobody could believe it      at this point /s4s/ is on its 3rd or 4th generation of users  while i agree how do you define that      the original 2013 crew the top lel top kek guys and music composers dispersed slowly it began to rise again from what  said      this
  why is a general about a musical genre allowed on a board for music  why is a general dedicated to high resolution kpop pics allowed on a board for high resolution pics  why is a general about kpop webms allowed on board for webms  why is a general about kpop allowed on a board for random international discussions  why is any thread allowed on a board made as a dumping ground for threads  not too bright are you
  i doubt it
helb 
  that spike on april 1
  this meme has gone too far
people think posts will dictate when a board is removed when /3/ still exists    oh no no no no
  also /mlp/ has an artistic output that is probably  only rivaled by pokemon and touhou    in quantity maybe in quality though no way
  dis
  from what ive heard once bitcoin became super popular /biz/ got flooded and the original user base is pretty much gone
  the maletofemale trans general dominates /lgbt/ and its not only full of tripfags but it has links to fucking reddit in their op    /lgbtr/
  /soc/ is straight men posting dick pics to other straight men
  or maybe /pol/ is just full of stupid hicks who think theyre geniuses for talking out of their asses
so how dead does /mlp/ have to be for gr15 to get removed i want to see barneyfag have an existential crisis
  probably when the show ends next year  not even im sure yet especially since when it ends the next generation of the franchise starts the following year with a new movie and show  i havent seen any boards that have been deleted due to obsolescence and its still somewhat popular probably the 28th fastest board on the site right now just above /o/  at this rate /f/ has a better chance of being deleted given how flash is going to be discontinued by 2020
im guessing this doubling of posts in /wsg/ is the tiktok spam
  cant believe its ending next year its been so long
  yfw mlp will have been on air for more than half of 4chans age  yfw /mlp/ and gr15 will have existed for almost half of 4chans age  yfw were all still here
  tfw /cm/ is having surge
  literally my first thought were approaching to a new era of cuteposting
  its imbortant to note that the data for that chart doesnt include april 2013 through october 2013 anecdotally speaking the post rate was higher in the first bit of s4ss life then tapered off while it was unlisted factually speaking the earliest archived post was  on november 1st 2013 so over the 6 months before then the average post rate was about 6476 posts a day although this ignores that the post rate was much higher during the first bit of april and s4s was an unlisted board during this time    also the rightmost point in that chart is april 2018 which is when s4s picks up pace because of birthday posting the current posting rate is pretty similar to 20152018
    i never understood why /pol/ attracts so many causefaggots who treat the board as srs bsns 4chan is last place you would want to do any political activism from given all the trolls and shitposters trying to derail threads or get reactions out of people  the site has no structural barriers to entry so any movement can easily be coopted by entryism and whatever meddling thats done by political think tanks/bots/whoever is in many ways indistinguishable from said trolls and shitposters
  imbortant
  soon itll be a whole decade
  trump won shareblue shill
  i dont understand why its so hard to comprehend the popularity of /lgbt/ board or what should be renamed as the / g t/ board    what the fuck did you think 15 years of porn addiction a need for more niche porn and no women were going to result in
  /pol/ is sharered
   mlp will have been on air for more than half of 4chans age  fim/g4 mlp as a whole is way older
  that makes it even more depressing
/lgbt/ rising  woah woah woah  are you saying there are more dykes here    what the fuck do you mean there are more dykes    is this what the world has come 2    am i gonna have to start spamming yaoi to spam homo lez away
this is all fine so basically i can get down with what were all saying here which is to delete /v/ /pol/ /gif/ /lgbt/ and /mlp/ this basically translates to deleting kids stormniggers normalfags literal tripfags/namefags and horsefuckers
  3 of those boards are among my favorites you sound like a shitposter
  i browse /mlp/ and previously /pol/ but id trade /mlp/ to see the other 4 killed if three of those boards are among your favorites in current you are unadultered aids please kms yourself
  but id trade /mlp/ to see the other 4 killed  youre alright horsefucker youre alright
  stable  this save for the drop in /bant/s population this august or the bleeding off of interest in a the board after it was created /bant/ is rather static in terms of userbase
  think a majority of us went back to anime a few years back desu i stopped watching and posting around season 5 which was 2015 i thinks
  are they the trans that sucker in bisexual guys or the ones that steal all the questioning straight girls
  
  4stats tracks posting rates so its not the best proxy for popularity with that in mind people on /cm/ might have just decided to post less one day and more the other
  jan 22nd was a 4chan outage you will see similar drops on other boards that day
loli board when  or allow us to post doujins on /h/    looking at these stats im scated for this sites feature and were already at a low point
  never
  mlp is ending next year
  the cartoon is but not the board
  well see about that

thread motto 
i have no idea wtf im doing but ive decided to get into 4chan because i saw some videos specifically vavetitan and wanted to see for myself what it was all about so can someone help introduce me to this site or at least help me in some way
lurk more
thanks for advice i think
  search tuxedo pepe on google images  then create a thread on /v/ containing that image and the text fuck jannies
somebody post that screencap while its not too late
  ill help you out by just stating this  4chan is not the lulz epic /pol/itical trolling website most youtubers make it out to be while that is one part of it a large majority of the website is focused on different kinds of topics with different kinds of people some take to the websites roots and post anything and everything animerelated some are just here to have fun and goof off some take to serious discussion about their hobbies etc etc what i would suggest for you new user is to find a board that fits any topic that interests you lurk there for about a year or two to get an idea of what its like and determine if you like the anons there if you like it you can begin posting if not maybe another website is better suited for you and to end this off ill say that  is terrible advice and will only get you reported as spam
  cringe and bluepilled
  go back
lurk for two years before posting make an effort to not read the same shit threads every day
lets have some fun /qa/  you can become a master in any single skill of your choice however any attempt to earn money/profit off of this skill will result in you losing both the given talent and the natural talent you once had for said skill making you a complete failure at it  what do you choose and why  personally id choose to be master artist just so that i could draw my waifu
hmmm  i was thinking something like programming but if i ever needed money thatd be something that i would potentially want to use so not that so im left with a choice in the arts department since im less susceptible to making money off it and would probably just do it for the fun of it i could be a master at art video/picture editing or writing art would be great since i could essentially draw whatever i had in my head and make the things ive always dreamed of making however if i was an expert at editing i could make all those image edits ive thought about while looking at things and i could make a whole bunch of neat videos and webms that may last for a long while and maybe improve things for the better if theyre good enough but then theres writing which would allow me to clearly communicate all my thoughts into words and hopefully improve my understanding of how to word sentences/arguments well or do whatever i please with my words i could probably convince people to actually improve upon themselves if i could write well enough just as well id be able to create stories humorous and interesting thatd be able to entertain others and put people in a good mood   however since i can only choose one i guess id go for art since thats probably the one thin im currently worst at i can barely get anything anatomically correct if i draw a person more complex than a stick figure
did  not  read
when you reach the zenith in any kind of skill everything slightly associated with it also gets risen to extremely high proficiency i forgot the name of they coined for this but think of a graph thats shaped like a mountain most any skill i can think of will bleed off into how i frame the world so theyll indirectly influence how i make money    i think culinary woodworking and sanitation wont have too much influence on other things unless mastery is to an absurd degree between the three id pick culinary if mastery isnt too extreme sanitation if its moderately extreme and woodworking if its really absurd
playing the accordion profit in what way maybe id want a youtube channel i wouldnt have to monetize it but profit might be the value i feel towards being popular and wellliked if i go to a party and play and become a hit that night does that count as profit even if i make no literal money
  didnt think of culinary it could be nice depending on if you like to cook i dont really care much for cooking complex meals so i feel like it would be wasted on me      was mostly thinking monetary profit or directly trading for other goods and services any emotional value you get is fine
professional nog free gibs
drawing obviously    im already fucking rich from crypto  i just want fucking fans  im fact  fuck the talent  just give me fans all i want is a fanbase  i dont evem need fangirls just at least 1000 people who read muh stuff one day
  im already fucking rich from crypto  hope youve sold
  you can become a master in any single skill of your choice  master of dicking women
  crypto is just beginning    all the major financiers who were shit talking bitcoin pre 2017 all bpught into crypto  dont be fooled by the whole normie big bang fad that happened last year you think normoes throwimg in 1000 actually made a difference on the marlet normies are too dumb to buy anything not tron bitconnect or the big 4    but i do not think bitcoin will last bitcoin has been obsolete since 2014  whats really going to take over the world is ethereum and ethereum based tokens and of the tokens thay will be most successful even more successful than eth will be chainlink    i hold link about 400 k    it went from rank 110 to rank 40 something in 3 months that meams it beat 60 other coins om the market    i am 100 confident that im gonna be a multi millionaire in the future
  i dont remember if i asked you this before or not but i have 300 shares in a healthcare company over 300/share so thats like 90k or so how do i become rich dont say put it all in chainlink
  well any company with a 30 billion market cap wont make you rich at all since thing like appl are only 500 billion so you saying its 300 a share means nothing only the market cap    have you googled and read lots of info about your company how often is it mentioned on the news is it in a lot of lists like  top 10 stocks to hold for 2019    i find that top 10 lists are the biggest indicator for a stocks success desu  if you see your stock in 20 top tem lists just in this months its a good stock  if it only been featured once it probably sucks    this is only true for stocks tho   and even then the stock marlet is about to collapse     if youre going with stocks i would just swing trade shit like jnug with 5000 on robinhood because having 25 k allows you to swing fact a good swing trader can make money even in a bear market especially when trading gold  but swing traders make jack shit compared to successful longterm theres a reason why warren buffet was a longterm holder    if you were going long in commoditie etfs i would go all in on ugaz weve had pretty warm weather so far but i have a feeling winter is going to hit like a bitch in january and get really really extreme    anyway  youre retarded if you dont go all in on link its going to be one of the most revolutionary features ever connecting raw data with the blockchain k a deventralized oracle
  ive had the stocks since i was born they were like 12/share back then  but i dont know anything whatever a market cap is or whats high or low ive read info about the company but none of it makes much sense
  do i need to actively avoid profiting from it is the deal based on intent to profit or on actual profit    id learn to accordion and play bach on the street  
sexing
  even kyubey couldnt help you with that
interesting question
  im going to say actual profit but if someone tries to give you donations it doesnt isntantly take away your skill you just cant accept it and if you are playing on the street and someone throws money in your case or something you could just dump it out when you are done however i will allow working for charity as long as none of the proceeds go to you
answering questions
programming probably specifically as it concerns building and maintaining websites
conjuring cute 2d girls  for obvious reasons
  living so i can stop thinking about dying
does the skill have to be real
  pretty much yeah so if you choose sorcery/magic you gain extensive knowledge of the sorcery and magic in fictional universes also you get to be really good at slight if hand magic
  making madoka threads not shit
  id like to be a master spinner  i love to spin wool
  see  
  improving discourse isnt a skill
  its not possible thats the point
fun fun is fun
what about athleticism does that count as a skill or is that too broad of a term
legendary weenspermer  so i can impress all my /qa/ friends
asking questions
programming so i can help all of my /qa/ friends and not just be some dummy that can only suggest things
math so i can better understand the universe
so you wanna be the master of pokemon  do you have the skills to be number one      you should probably specialize in something
  be careful thats extremely general you cant profit off it at all or youll lose it and i dont think its even possible to avoid profiting off of it unless you swear yourself to a life of manual labor only math skills would naturally help anything you do even like passive investment or some shit   though maybe a comfy life of unwraveling the secrets of the universe would feel really good even if you were poor you could even solve millennium prize problems if you turned down the money as already mentioned by others itt popularity and prestige gained from your skill doesnt count as profit unless you use it for career advancement being some sort of stoic minimalist mathematics god would be super fucking cool actually
  persuasion ill be the king of 4channel if not japanese or art to draw my waifu
mods are trying to hide the truth
holy fuck
the text at the top clearly states that theres a setting under navigation to display the full list of boards so where the heck is this navigation because its obviously not under settings
visit any thread  press settings  navigation  cant do it from the catalog since it gives a different list    post more kitties
  thank you very much  shall we convert this to a qtddtot or just request that the mods delete it
  the /qa/ cathes come here to smoke at us
  aww what a happy cat

  suck more mod cock fag
  lole youre so kawaii anon i luv uuuuuu
  thanks 
its not like we know his ban record  just that hes a jerk to people on irc  some of the other mods not on irc would probably be even jerkier or more autistic  imagine bat_guano talking to users on irc
  mods like to be blown not sucked get it right loser
  he hates lolis and shotas
  and most of us are very grateful
  he is based because he hates anime
  hes a fucking faggot like every mod here whos not swaglord

  how is this not original
whats the point of fighting games
low test post
  for nigs and nogs to be violent legally
  doesnt seem like the brightest interpretation
selfinsertion power fantasy  a way for 400 pound blobs to feel fit and powerful
  to play against your frens and have fun  and also to go on a journey of selfimprovement to develop your skill at the game taking fulfillment from your personal progress
what she said  
fun
  fun is a meaningless buzzword
boob physics
to play as cute girls beating each other up obviously
whats that one fighting game where the girls clothes get ripped as they take damage
  dead or alive
  dead or alive
  soul calibur does it too now
  playing as your favorite characters and beating up other characters with maybe some extra story  you dont play fighting games that arent based on franchise do you op

you dont know what you have until you dont have it at least fireden still works
how do you successfully spur content creation and creativity on a given board do you force a meme make a drawthread do you just post just what youve got how can it be promoted as something fun what motivates those rare spurs wherein content is created is there some kinda reciprocated competition between posters to make content in those instances is it dependent on certain board conditions on the type of board
content creators    anyone who uses this phrase is a narcissistic furfag more interested in being seen as a creator than producing quality work    all the draw threads should be removed for this reason    seeing them pop up on every board without protest is a sign of the declining moderation here
  if a certain board has been abused to hell and back theres little chance of posters being willing to provide oc due to dissatisfaction with the state of the board if major problems plaguing the board arent managed or fixed completely then it becomes a downward spiral i think one such example is /qa/ where youve had the notable /qa/tan making silly fun and also metaesque threads but he has long ceased to post    i also recall /v/ having some spur of the moment oc once in a while as it is also confirmed by the happenings thread i would wager my guess on the continuous new user influx that will always have the potential to create oc since they have no past to compare to the current board state as it is their now there should be nothing to inhibit their creative spirits i want to also remark that there are however stubborn users who while they appear once in a blue moon despite the constantly declining board quality manage to contribute to the board positively and have been for a long time those are a rare and/or dying breed in of itself
  you have mental issues
  maybe it helps to have something to make oc about something people know the community is interested in or some notable happening
  do you force a meme make a drawthread do you just post just what youve got  any of the above i guess
  do something that inspires oc
every post i make is content i have created i bless 4channel with my witty retorts
  cringed
  thanks for the contribution fellow content creator
  okay i actually cringed hard
i made a content
make more oc
  desu he left around the time /qa/ got listed rather than when people invaded  and i tend to make stuff although i dont usually post stuff i make here since a lot of my humor is bizarre generally though what lowers my use of making dumb stuff for people to laugh at is just being busy or other irl shit
  you get topicappropriate moderation that means no politics or porn make a board good for discussion of something and the people who care about it enough will come
7chi
lele
  he made a couple of posts after /qa/ got listed
  and thats why /bant/ is the hotbed of content creation
  good job anon  maybe if we all post contrarian paint garbage someone will be contrarian to that and upload something decent
  i dunno sometimes i think of something funny and give it a try like i thought what about spurdo in arx making a benis rune and then i made pic and later am going to ask /wsg/ about how the fuck can i make a gif  id never force a meme and my only interest is to have fun myself and amuse others in a noncancerous way dunno what you mean about board conditions and i like the idea of cooperation more than competition
  nice butte n hipz love /qa/tan
  you now realize this was the wojak posters plan all along
just make it
post whatever music you feel like posting  
been humming this one a lot recently  
  thats a pretty unusual intro
oh yeah brother  
  this version is optimized for headphone consumption a version for stereo speakers although from an amiga emulator not real hardware can be found here  
vidya esque original music    
  whats the cutest version of this
  original for sure mirai akari just doesnt have what it takes  
  very cute
  thank god for akane not sure id be able to find a picture that conveys emotions similar to this song without searching for hours for one
  think im going to go through and listen to every song in this thread might take a while
  whats the difference between them
  love the yuru yuris
  the former arranges the output as virtual surround sound channels and applies a dolby headphone effect a fancy name for a headrelated transfer function to make the music sound more natural to headphone users so it seems to appear from a sound source in front of you instead from inside your head  the latter is pretty much the raw output but with some crossmixing on the stereo channels as the amigas sound output was notorious for strict stereo separation two channels on the left side two channels on the right which may be unpleasant to listen to especially with headphones  
  the title quite literally means wageslave
  someone should sing the /qa/ version
  everyone wearing a bikini but the protagonist  no wonder shes invisible
i dont care too much for the dnb sections of this but the trumpets are doing good things to my ears  
  how did you like the show
  i havent finished it yet been watching 1 or 2 episodes a day i like it a lot though
  whats the best music for going to sleep
  fuwafuwa
  
  metal miku
  a bit weird throughout no doubt intentionally
    thats actually pretty nice
  its easier if you open this thread first and then play the music in the background while reading the others
nice music
  install linux on your personal computer
  black leather lords  were so tall and so proud
  in the commentaries and documentaries accompanying the extended dvd edition of the film director peter jackson explains that the song wasnt inspired by frodo but by the premature death from cancer of young new zealand filmmaker cameron duncan whose work had impressed jackson and his team the first public performance of the song was at duncans funeral

to all our readers in the us  its a little awkward so well get straight to the point this monday we humbly ask you to defend wikipedias independence we depend on donations averaging about 1636 but 99 of our readers dont give if everyone reading this gave 3 we could keep wikipedia thriving for years to come the price of your monday coffee is all we need when we made wikipedia a nonprofit people warned us wed regret it but if wikipedia became commercial it would be a great loss to the world wikipedia is a place to learn not a place for advertising it unites all of us who love knowledge contributors readers and the donors who keep us thriving the heart and soul of wikipedia is a community of people working to bring you unlimited access to reliable neutral information please take a minute to help us keep wikipedia growing thank you
i wised up after the first few rounds of ads and made 4chan whitelist only in umatrix so i dunno what ads these are
  99 of our readers dont give   
  lol
  a damn
just fucking do it
  whats lurking
  more  stupid zoomers dont even know how to spell correctly
  isnt shia lebouf a spoiled manchild constantly on the brink of sucide lets take his advice
registrationfree boards arent exactly a system that encourages lurking are they
lurking means reading kym right
  no oldfags read ed
  no they read lurkmore
how can we make people lurk moar again answer must not involve confusing them with memes that didnt work
mfw i write wikipedia entries and use 4chan threads as sources
a lot of people on 4chan lost the distinction between stupid lazy questions that should be shat on and questions that it would be helpful to answer
  what do you expect when they spend all day on websites that train them to expect a reward for responding eg karma likes shares etc
  they lost the distinction a long time before that
  banning people who ask for sauce or help in general
  i posted once on /b/ and got told to lurk for at least 2 years i then proceeded to lurk for 2 years that was 12 years ago
  did you learn anything by lurking
spoiler lurking was never intended to be taken literally  it was just a way to tell people to fuck off because of their overt ignorance
  it was only as a joke i swear  and your second line doesnt contradict what lurking means
  i wonder how much mods bother to lurk these days
hello /qa/  quality anime how was your day  checks catalog  oh my whats going on here

which vpn is the best
  depends on what you want to do with it  for simple i dont want that site to know who i am nordvpn is cheap enough and has tons of servers no reason why you should invest in anything expensive    if you want it for privacy and sharing sensitive informations using a vpn is the worst choice you could make you are routing all your traffic through some shady vpn provider from the other site of the world nordvpn and luminati and some other big providers are all owned by one israeli company you really want to share everything you do on the internet with them    if you want it for shitposting on 4chan so that you can evade bans this is what i think you want to do looking for vpns is also the wrong thing to do you would rather want some simple but big proxy pool but i wont give you suggestions because you would just use it for posting weeb shit spam here
your own network of vpss rented using crypto currencies
its better to make your own
i just use tor when i need anonymity
i love anime
you could get laid twice for that price
  cute figures a bit cliche tho
i too like the animated cartoons
  nendroids are really ugly
cute figures
you had to post this while all mine are in storage didnt you
yeah
  no you dont you wouldnt shitpost it if you did youre a selfish turd who would shitpost every single one if you felt you would get attention for it
  funko pops are worse shut up
  nice ritsu
  i agree but what does that have to do with anything
  funko are worse but theyre both real bad
lol same
  eh its a mixed bag none of them compare to real figurines but their price means more people can actually buy them

see all the people that studied with me graduating from college   most of them are a bunch of jobbers with money   i struggled my ass off to get good grades keep it good and yet i failed to graduate this year   fuck this shit already why people that didnt do shit are graduating and the ones we deserved are a fucking failure   fuck this gay earth
  its all fucked shit is fucked
  dont worry by the time you are 40 some of those people will be dead and you will wonder how you survived
dumb cat poster    /qa/  quality amphibians
  i failed to graduate this year    yikes
im 25 and i never even finished community college
  imagine being a floridian
  but im not
does anyone else dislike posts that are not using an anime picture
no 3d pictures can be great
i dislike posts that feature catkillers
  stay on your safespace board and you will be fine

how do we stop the fucking zoomers from shitting up entire boards /vg/ is getting infested with retarded moneygrabbing anime mobage garbage and /wsg/ is being overrun with stupid tiktok shit should the minimum age for posting be raised to 27
idk
what are you gonna do make users upload their photo id and add image verification everytime they post retard boomer
  haha
kanji captcha
  gen z go home
everyone here was a zoomer back in 0309
    yes and we had good taste in everything zoomers dont have that 5 years from now you will see them talking about how their tiktok camwhores were good back in the day how fortnite was such a good game and some other cringy shit
sips  yup fortnite was a damn good game they just dont make em like they used to
  except that its shit because it doesnt have gnu/linux support
  you are the problem boomers and zoomers is just a forced /v/eddit meme
  no idea what that is old man
where were all these freaks hiding before discord existed
    generation gaps were invented on 4chan
  this gif always bothered me because it didnt actually show any flossing
bump
  the answer is always higher standards if they cant keep up they get banned
  should the minimum age for posting be raised to 27  raise it to 100 shit doesnt matter at all that rule only exists to ban people that are actually dumb enough to post their age when theyre under 18
  its honestly a pretty pointless rule when the posting standards are unsupervised middle school locker room tier
  generation gaps were invented  this
anime mobile game players are pretty old though its mostly early twenty somethings who sperg out about how people spend their free time
 /qa/
brilliant parody thread
good timing
do you use ttsreader
reading is such a hassle
would there be a way to play mario rpg that could somehow include /qa/
like what different people controlling each character even if you could thats still only 3 people
  yeah i was thinking that seems a bit low thats why im trying to think up ideas since i really love the game but would want for all of /qa/ to be able to play it together somehow
  a chatroom that cycles players every battle
  hmmm that doesnt sound too bad of an idea though it may take time to figure out i think it could work out
    this sounds like the best way to go about it anything using posts over here would be terribly slow
  whats the game like
could be fun
add me in ill get us the super suit
  timed button presses  essentially a jrpg with a billion quicktime elements
now that the idea is in place i guess the only problem would be figuring out how to actually make a stream of the game of sorts where people can pass the controls to each other
  maybe this it says you only need irc not necessarily twitch  
  bumping for this
unpopular opinion time this game fucking sucked and was a huge disappointment given how gorgeous it looks from a graphics standpoint could have been an awesome 25d platformer but instead it has a bizarre pokemonesque battle system that interrupts the flow at every opportunity
  im not sure why you expected a game with rpg in the title to not be an rpg
hold up it looks like the twitchplays sort of stuff is pretty slow to react and i dont think that will mesh well with a game whose combat is based on timed presses it sounds messy    it could be rigged to only pay attention to a certain user taken from a list and then cycle through the different names
  bizarre pokemonesque battle system that interrupts the flow at every opportunity
  i think he means that he doesnt like turn based rpg combat
google says parsec is the most popular thing for online controller sharing didnt look too much into it
cool
  its alright ive been looking into it myself
  just create a roleplay dnd version
  but then what would you do about the music  
  i see
you could do a rom hack  or you could just make your own rpg    either way imageboard games usually dont go to far
playing games with friends is fun
fishe
itt we discuss the recent bans and whether they were justified  
i want to see what they didnt ban
  women ruin everything even hunting specially when half of them are instagram whores selling hunting equipment to boomers    ban 3 days
reasonable chucklegif
banned for off topic
  only 30 days why not 2 years until his birthday
how many years has barneyfag poster been at it jesus christ
  about 4 or 5
  nice quads but dont talk to me loser
  what kind of porn do you think hirohito is watching
ill never understand why loli and shota porn are banned in /trash/ of all places
  the furry mod still has morals
  pedos are not welcome
  verniy how much free time do you have that allows you to do this
  dont bully my op
  didnt mean to bully i was just curious
  maybe they think they can react faster to 3d if they keep the pedos in one place  or that at least it will be pushed off the board quickly if they dont do anything
very classy board
  i dont think any of the janitors or mods have very strong morals im just not feeling it maybe it has something to do with one or more of them leaving fetish threads and posts up while deleting threads that criticize moderation for leaving fetish threads up they both break the rules so why not get rid of both
bans dont do a lot these days
  a lot of people who deserve it dont even get banned in the first place
they all look justified to me
so fucking sexy /a/ ban  kek
hmm
lol
kek
  that ban was excessive
lol some guy banned for 3 days for posting bandaid vagina right next to bandaid nipples
  dont for one second think the plague of underage users isnt sitewide tons of them are on the boards you frequent
  these have to be fbi looking to find pedos  there cant be this many underage females looking to fuck neckbeards they meet on 4chan
 s4s anonymous i evaded my ban and now i can post agen yay yay dont tell on me  ban 30 days global 9  ban evasion  it was a bit dumb to tell this   another discovery   hm who or what is a barneyfag
  ill never understand why /trash/ even exists to begin with      he fell for the pedophile meme
whats the point of archiving bans without archiving the thumbnails    its not like it would take up much space either
its all /tv/ /v/ and /pol/ lmao
    hiro is suppose to ban reddit if he wants this place to be good again
   /v/  anonymous  based sony  warn  n/a  global 6  quality of posts  11/25/18sun233151  hilarious
  hm who or what is a barneyfag  see 
  /pol/ and /v/ are the most popular boards on 4chan
how long do these things last usually kind of annoying tbf
  and /b/
  i was range banned even after checking my ban status which told me i wasnt for like 4 hours so i just waited until the next day and i was fine phoneposting actually worked as a workaround during that time
    none of it was justified half this site is faggots this is why voatco is now superior to 4chan nothing is banned from system subs other than as spam or cp
  be sure to recruit as many people as you can from 4chan and take them with you
  i doubt he has to do much to maintain it
why doesnt it log rule 1 bans  im trying to find my jailbait threads
discuss a fighting game on /v/  get banned
  why dont you show the mlp image you posted to ask the question you faggot
not using my bloated javascript version which shows the archive links  no im not including it on the server side version
  could you rephrase that into a coherent sentence paco
  why dont you show the my little pony image you posted to ask the question you faggot  the ban wasnt for discussing a fighting game its for posting my little pony outside of /mlp/  now youre showing a pattern of lacking reading comprehension
  i mean dahlia has a following
  why dont you show the my little pony image you posted to ask the question you faggot  im not that poster faggot i dont even browse the shitfest that is /v/  copy and paste text into google    please point to the my little pony character in that picture anon
  im not that poster faggot i dont even browse the shitfest that is /v/  yet you didnt have trouble acting like you knew everything about it    please point to the my little pony character in that picture anon  uh the fucking ponies above and below the title
  yet you didnt have trouble acting like you knew everything about it  because there is no pony fighting game on the steam store  uh the fucking ponies above and below the title  none of those are my little pony characters retard try again
  why dont you post what an mlp looks like then faggot since youre such a god damn expert or are you just pretending to be retarded
        a pony fighting game by the person that made mlp doesnt belong in /mlp/  theres reaching and then theres this
  why dont you post what an mlp looks like then  why dont you learn how to use google anon    i guess every cartoon she has worked on also belongs on /mlp/ then right
  why dont you learn how to use google anon  because im not arguing with google im arguing with you prove your point or fuck off
  i guess every cartoon she has worked on also belongs on /mlp/ then right  1 its not a cartoon its a game dont expect a brainlet like you to get that  2 it is if it uses mlp characters
  youre not arguing at all youre just trying to bait me into getting myself banned    so every game she works on belongs on /mlp/ okay i think i understand now thanks  it is if it uses mlp characters  wait a minute you lost me again like i said there isnt a single my little pony character in that game
  youre not arguing at all youre just trying to bait me into getting myself banned  so then you acknowledge that it was justifiably banned  discussion over go basedsplain to someone else
  are you pretending to be retarded posting my little pony characters outside of /mlp/ is a justifiable ban getting banned because someone posted about a fighting game that isnt about my little pony isnt  discussion over  the equivalent of /threading your own post did you exit and hide the thread too anon
  kek
  furry hates lolicons  pots hate kettles  i dont go there but that shit makes no sense at all there are people dumping horse porn in aco but images of people handholding while fucking ilya arent allowed
  people handholding while fucking ilya arent allowed  it should be legal to be honest
  the javascript version of that site view the dynamic listings has an additional archive link for every post that successfully finds the associated post by post content filename poster name and date in the boardspecific archive in most cases  the ban archive itself only archives what you can see on the ban page
  as often as the mods have to squish posts with pepe and wojak attached to them i wonder why they havent just created some algorithm to automatically detect and ban the durned things would save them a lot of trouble
  my favorite
  ban evading mlp fag going on ultra damage control over his thinly veiled mlp thread getting sacked for being posted out of /mlp/  its like pottery
when alternative is feeling especially mad at me he goes hunting for my threads and posts like this   its kind of funny how petty he is
  where do you post that you havent heard of him on second thought dont answer that question
  yes  god he got so much hate for that one word including from a lot of nazis that justified his stance
       
why not a warning
i got banned for brap shitposting on /pol/ 3 day banhow the fuck do mods justify this bullshit no fucking fun allowed yet they dont even moderate or follow their own rules literally not even a warning a ban for this this isnt the worst though i got banned for posting seething in a thread a few months ago ive also been banned for posting sneed once in a thread on /tv/ all 3 day bans not even warnings     you know the hilarious part is that racism is not allowed outside /b/ yet 80 of /pol/ is racism trolling and other off topic bullshit but that never gets moderated or enforced but oh no make one innocent shitpost and the mods go on a power trip
  no you were banned from all boards meaning you are ban evading why do you even complain about your bans if youre going to evade them anyway and no nobody believes you are going to serve the ones you deem deserved
  being banned from all boards does not mean someone was ban evading
  yes it does its literally you the one whos banned the means to do so happen to be ip bans but if you are posting during your ban period you are ban evading
  no one asked
i read through about 10 pages of these and its about 90 legit bans which i suspected but then there are legit good posts or straight up on topic posts that just get banned leading me to believe the mods do sometimes just ban people who say something they dont like  also i saw a ban on /s4s/ and it was someone talking about the state of the economy in ghana and it was quite the complex post made me laugh
  what were the common ban reasons for the legitimate posts
what the fuck
  this is some prime fucking entertainment i love this
    what motivates them
  your ban was deserved now kill yourself or dont do it again
  die you fucking barneyfag
  hes gonna go far in life
  i got banned for brap shitposting  good
post the same as i always have  get banned for 90 days for proxy/vpn  appeal  denied but commuted to 4 days  i dont understand was it because i refreshed too many recaptchas when it was acting insane after the split or did i piss off a janny who made up some bullshit reason and mods signed off on it why was it commuted to 4 days either i was using a proxy to samefag or evade the post timer or i wasnt so why commute it instead of lifting i wasnt proxying i wasnt rebooting my router frequently to get a new ip i dont use a vpn i post almost elusively in /adv/ where i offer actual advice /civ4xg/ and worksafe loli and pout threads here i have no idea what i did i dont go running strange exes i really doubt i am being used as a proxy by someone else i dont even post pepe or wojak very often and when i do they are used in the traditional way sad feels  what am i supposed to learn from this give up on posting from my pc and only phonepost to avoid bans doled out for no reason
  its all porn dump ban evasion or underaged lole
well thats just fucking retarded
when its ban and it says na for length does that mean perma
  or maybe a warn
mods have been banning psyposters on /x/    shit i like those threads
    literally not one of these are justified  rip 4chan
  actually the majority of them are incredibly justified
  sure if youre a nofun reddit diaspora
    jesus christ
ip bans are a shitty moderation tool
  everyone already knew /r9k/ was the most underage board next to /pol/
fuck abib or whoever has a hateboner for lolis and shotas
  you could have make the exact same thread on /c/ nobody has a problem with you posting loli but doing so where its offtopic
  that doesnt justify a ban if the mod believed that my thread belonged to /c/ he would have moved it as he does with all the threads that are moved to /qa/ /b/ /trash/ and other boards every day  even if the mod had given a real explanation either in the thread or in my ban message as to why my thread broke the rules would have been better than a generic message that doesnt explain anything and only makes them look completely incompetent
  masturbating to preteen girls not ok on the sfw video game board  masturbating to underage teenagers and older fine on the sfw video game board  see if moderation could get their act together and ban all people who use the boards to turn themselves on the people jerking off to preteens wouldnt have fuel either this is bias or moderation really does have no idea how to judge what is and isnt sfw
  i didnt even want lewd pics i collect cute and wholesome pics of lolis and shotas even the op mentioned it  i made the thread in /v/ because it was more prone to get replies than the image dump boards
  underage teenagers is the superior choice though
  the people who jerk it to that kind of thing probably would have flooded the thread thats the logic the mod would use and its not wrong     but then that raises a question why would such a thread be so severely threatened by porn why act against the symptom and not the cause  what really makes it possible for that to happen
  fpbp
im fucking mad at the amount of warnings when i get a 3 day vacation for exactly the same thing
  and its not wrong  yes it is
bans are usually justified
  you should have lower expectations on the fairness of bans and the universe in general who knows maybe some mod misclicked maybe your shit was ajacent to someone elses in any case your life really wouldnt be any worse if you actually did sit out the 90 days hell you even could phonepost if you gave that much of a fuck
  /l/ is gone and loli inconsistently eats banhammer all the time you arent owed a move is this outcome really all that suprising
bans are not that important
holy shit why do so many underage kids greeentext most of them arent even good stories
what
this is from the peak of the anti loli bans from a while ago
  loli got banned sitewide after moot got cold feet about exactly how legal it was the laws regarding what is and isnt considered cp are a bit more vague than they should be
bans are never justified
  i just dont get why it was commuted  if they think im guilty i should get the full punishment  if they think im not guilty i should not be punished at all
  what do people use this term sexualizing to mean  nobody is sexualizing young girls they are sexual entities inherently
  wtf theres actually a place to see all bans what is this website are 4chan admins aware of this
  autism built such things as the linux kernel why are you surprised
  complains for being banned for shitposting  what did you mean by this
  
  oh i thought it was all bans
  you clearly have no clue here you should reasonably expect to be banned for anything not liking chocolate milk shopping hiroki with a santa hat posting 19th century czarist artwork     dont sweat the details so much not every ban is a directive or a lesson
bans are always justified
  what am i supposed to learn from this  that the people holding the sticks arent omniscient but human    recall your high school days the teachers werent always right as an adult now other adults you know can be wrong the police can be wrong the courts can be wrong and even 4chan mods can make mistakes    irl its an issue but here with a little bit of effort its water off of a ducks back unfortunately its also water off of a ducks back for malcontents too
are you gay or something   one week ban
  bans for proxy/vpn are automated no one will ban you for using one unless you explicitly state so someone on the dev team set up a scraper that automatically searches and bans public proxies for 90 days used to be less than that though since 2014 if im not mistaken in time it became more efficient it has nothing to do with captchas or posting patters your ip either appeared on a blacklist or some proxy site blame your isp
  that was a good post though
  i am happy you got this ban and hope you get more
random range bans on certain boards  posting was reenabled for these ranges but posting with image is still range banned    no amount of range bans will get me to buy a pass you cunts
  i see verizon must have been changing my ip frequently maybe its less paperwork to commute than repeal ipv4 exhaustion and levels of nat that shouldnt even be possible will make everyone look like a proxy poster within a few years
  nano a cute  warning    for what reason
  what does retarded template babytalk add to the board
  red  unjustified    jannies btfo
harsh
  phoneposting  cropping off what boards they were posted on  typing retard shorthand  being a fag
  do you believe its wrong when posters on /lgbt/ are not interested in bestiality  thats typically a stereotype for posters on boards like /an/ or /mlp/
  interesting
your time is up weebniggers
  not so fast sadfrog

teen shlock
why is everything so censored these days  it feels like everyone is afraid of offending certain group of people  isnt this the very same oppression they are trying to fight against are these censor happy people just hypocrites
political paradigm shift  just ignore it theyre just filling a social role that will always exist in society  theres no convincing them
  i assume youre talking about america  racial and ethnic tensions are getting worse and worse by the day in 30 years were either going to have a full on race war or an oppressive corrupt government that censors and suicides everybody who speaks against it if you want to see an early example of totalitarian political repression look at the proud boys vs antifa thing leftwing terrorists are never arrested and tried for their crimes but rightwingers get buttfucked by the state for peaceful demonstrations and selfdefense
why do people correlate hate speech with free speech 4chan has went extremely downhill over the last few years in this regard    the longer that japmoot supports hate speech in the guise of free speech the sooner it will be that is site will be nothing but filled with complete cunts moaning about shit and how they cant get laid
  pol fags always trying to inject their toxic venom into every conversation
  im just against censorship in general  people are fast to use hate speech as a weapon to basically neuter everything  it starts with banning people saying racist stuff then before you know it these people are replacing lines of code like slavemaster because they are also racist    im no /pol/ user but this pc shit is starting to affect me in really negative ways things that werent politcal before are now obligated to follow a coc that wasnt needed before  i am honestly sick of it and id rather have everyone saying retarded shit than a censored world where people cling to these new rules just to have some power and remove or destroy stuff they dont like
  nothing is free you have to earn your respect unlike  who thinks you have the right to be obnoxious
  earn respect  on an anonymous imageboard  looks like someone needs to lurk moar
    yes there is always a line that has to be followed not everything is black and white hate speech or free but there has to be that line to far in any one direction leads to awful circumstances 4chan as a whole is leading to an example of this for the extremist point of view
  where does one draw the line then who decides whats wrong and whats right  the problems with 4chan are not even related to this they are more related to the awful moderation and general lack of direction from the admin
shut up niggers
  its just a pathway to power and control for most some however are just useful idiots for the power seekers      because free speech by definition includes hate speech and other forms of speech some groups of people find unpleasant
  it feels that way because more and more people are using the internet worse still is that some people think being on the internet gives them a free pass to be a horrible/idiotic person with little to no selfregulation and critical thinking no side or stance political or otherwise is immune to this these people dont think critically about the reality of the bigger picture and what part they are playing in it and they dont understand the intricacies of human nature instead they join groups of likeminded people and more or less ignore people outside of their circle this leads to poor circles of thought that do more bad than good for the long term what they want to believe becomes more important to them than reality and then they get angry if theyre told theyre wrong too many people being too sure of themselves is a death sentence for humanity    more people being trash  more countermeasures to get those people away but getting those people away isnt always taking out trash sometimes youre just hiding from things you dont like whether they be true or not
    the line is drawn by the people and countries they live in to me its more im fine with things as long as it doesnt affect the rights of a group or individual or incite violence on them     it is related to this as the problem with 4chan happens in 2016 when it doubled the user base to 120million in a few months mods couldnt handle it and now its got so far out of hand the whole site is fucked
    kill yourself schizo
  do you think those people came here because they are happy with their reality  politics in general create this climate of conflict  but my question has more to do with censorship in general do you believe that censoring and banning people out of your platform is the solution to all the problems
    do you believe that censoring and banning people out of your platform is the solution to all the problems    it would solve the problems of the site yes they would just go somewhere else to say it so wouldnt solve the issue it just an issue of should people be given a safe space to post whatever hateful shit they want id personally say yes they should but its not 4chan 4chan used to just be anti mainsteam for both sides its lost that ballance to me and i dont think it will get it back
  the whole internet was different back then  i dont think you realize that
  you have the right to be obnoxious  at least here in america we do  micromanagaing populations is the pathway to authoritarianism

hello this is varappi and i uh    i fucked up spine  it hurts to open doors now  how the fuck did the rowing machine do this to me    あんd i know i know its all the lesbians faults and the fucking nonvirgin chad guys  theyre trying to stop me  from being a virgin husband to muh future experience pseudomilf japanese wife who wub so much    but thats besides the point  the point is i bought some goddamnn creatine and this stuff is fucking freat i feel so much muscle mass  im growing tits  im growing boobs  muh futuer jap wife is lesbian  godd i love creatine     i will pour creatine on muh future wifes pussy while i ate her out    but  i cant do it now because muh spine is fucked up i bought this preworkout powder im dying to fantasize sucking out of jap wifes pussy   but muh back hurts  muh back hurts    probs gonna workout anyway  but its because of yoga and thats whut inspired me to make this thread to talk about the magic of yoga  all i do is streth my arms in very weird positions and holds but it works being able to move your arms everywhere  so i want you all to just tilt your back and stretch your arms out like your japanese wife has 500 tits    and i want to empahsize only do the upper body muscle and not stretch the legs like a girl  be a guy not a dick guy girl    is this homo hate hell yhea this is homo hate  im not letting my future japanese wife fuck me in the ass dont do yoga on the ass  okay maybe i will let her if she really wants too   but i dont fetishize it    i want to fuck future japanese wife whiel we do yoga together  im watching scot the wizard the pepto bismal enthutist dick girl   and his show is really really great i wuv it so funny i wuuuv it  but  the times he shows video game girl clips it reminds me i wnat a japanese wifeeee cosplay
sorry about your back but you should really get yourself a twitter account to post this stream of consciousness blogshit of yours
the op alone would take 7 tweets
  you said youd fuck off until saturday
  what the heck is going on in this picture
  if a 71 year old man named trump can do it so can you

i want muh future wife now    all i think about is how much i want to make future wife happy being paralyzed in bed
im posting using a tablet and the user experience is awful the thread watcher cannot be moved with a touch screen why is 4chan so neglectful when it comes to the experience of phones and tablet users
lol
  i dont see the point of thread watcher when you can just open your threads in different tabs
  i dont want my browser to be cluttered with several tabs also switching between threads is a lot easier on thread watcher than on tabs
  memory hog
  op is just trolling
  im really not thread watcher is a big deal for me the site gets a lot worse if it blocks my view and i cant drag it out of the way on a touch screen like i do with a mouse
  you can just press the x to hide it
  10/10
isnt the advertisement the ops image is from several years old why do i only get results from earlier this year or late last year or am i misremembering
  think its from last year
  because phone and tablets are for normies and you people dont belong on 4chan
  get a you faggot on android you can move it hold you finger a bit longer on the topbar of the threadwatcher and then slowly move your finger  also all these fucks who say that you can not see hovereffects or use css hover only navigations on a tablet are all stupid idiots
how do you feel about large things ever since i was a child i have had an odd fixation on very large things    do you prefer extraordinarily large things or extraordinarily small things
i like large breasts and large hips on women
i like small things like my johnson
large things are kind of inherently cool
if she can make her clothes grow can she make people she is touching grow can she make a car shes in grow
large creatures are cool large body parts are not

  maybe your biological clock ticks differently and you already have the sleeping schedule for you my biological clock is the same when you enter the tick tock clock course in sm64 at 6 i cant really stick to a sleeping schedule longterm i go to bed when im tired and wake up when im rested but it doesnt work out for me sadly      i dont really like green vegetables spinach is okay i guess i like carrots and tomatoes though    going to finish gochuumon wa usagi desu ka now got a headache at the moment hopefully it goes by soon
  the last time this happened it was because of an alarm i had set waking me up often without me realizing it was the alarm that did it ive already turned off the one on my phone as i was typing this i realized theres another one on my desktop hopefully turning it off fixes it

welcome to /qa/ friend
thanks based mods /qa/ is a blessed board and deserves more loli threads than the shithole that is /v/
video games hello
is /qa/ the loli board
  please dont sexualise my wife
  pastel colours
how is this /qa/ exactly
  or is it the anal board
  theres a question in the op therefore it belongs in /qa/
thank you for this quality anime thread mods
belly
  a n a l  n  a  l
  is /qa/ the official board for loli anal
shes a good girl
  no lewd lolis please this is 4channel
  god shes ugly
    images can be lewd but still sfw
  post more images from this set
shes a princess
how does her butt taste like
  never tasted a butt before but probably cleaner than most
  semen      but probably like used goods  fixed that for you thank me later
  a clean butt has no taste at all      like love
is /qa/ just a slower comfier verdion of /a/ with some meta threads
  comfier  try cancerous
  
do girls actually feel pleasure from butt sex
  well they dont have a cum button like men so i guess they need to be mega sluts to enjoy it
  but that just means they can go on enjoying it perpetually
  making a spoiled rich girl submit
putting her stomach first on a desk while you and a friend pound her ass and mouthpussy
fix it
so are you able to make a post now
get the hint retard
im anxiously waiting
nope
fuck off
so did you run into some thread locking limit or did you realize it was a bad idea to encourage me flood the board
 well it looks like hiro is busy   maybe send a message to his stream about your shyness problem or just wait till he is done i guess
  seething
mine doesnt work
okay  has really gone to shit
well that didnt take long
  i blame tiktok and underage faggots for that
  tiktok  the fuck is that
  a musical social network where you can make videos of yourself singing and dancing its popular because cute girls post there just check /wsg/ catalog and search tiktok
on /v/  talk about vidya franchises that have turned to shit  404s  yeah lets just have more shitposting about literal autistic streamers hitting themselves   todd buy my game howard thread 95831 corporate cocksucking console wars and   lolis
  the topic was vidya
  yep that seems like a highquality post
  nigga did you even read the thread  listing shit video games gets you banned  that fucking mod is abusing shit
  making templated request threads outside of /wsr/ with nonvideo game related pictures gets you banned
  it wasnt a request thread  it was a fuck video games thread at worst  literal hundreds of nonvideo game related pictures every day with no repercussion
  dude you made a shit thread and it got deleted get over it it wont keep you out of college
  stop parroting this everyone already knows thats false
  shit thread or not it didnt warrant deletion and it definitely didnt warrant a ban  if im to be held accountable so should the mod for not even reading the thread
  all images should pertain to video games  red letter media isnt video games
  he does it for free
  even if the rare occasions they arent shitposting what are some games/movies/anime threads count as requests and are against the rules anyway
    what are some games/movies/anime threads count as requests and are against the rules anyway  bullshit  theyre posted everyday with borderline degenerate sex shit without consequence  this one mod gets a hardon over an innocuous rlm pic and administers a banhammer  that mod is preserving the status quo of 4channel of being a cesspool
  you probably listed the cucks favourite game
illstart    my grandpa died 3 months ago i have no more time to think of you
well you see
im not real anon youre hallucinating me
im sugandese
  happened to me too weird
what would the next phase be
nothing anyone who posts that image is larping  every single of those is bad and the first isnt even applied in context main cancers of xyz era because old  good
4chan was never good came for the cancer stayed for the cancer
  she leaves 4chan and the internet for something real
  how was old 4chan like i joined in 2016 during the elections and lurked on /pol/ for a year until the boards got split and i had to quit it since 4chan is a shithole
  back then the most popular boards mission was to have fun not to be activists you can imagine what a difference that makes
  project chanology
  it was different in so many ways its hard to even begin and ive said this many times before but i think even oldfags forget  and like in this case  i think he has the right idea but i dont think those words convey to others exactly what he means by them and you can get the wrong idea from it  anons were always assholes to each other but it just didnt go so far the best way i can try to explain it is its more like everyone was just sure of themselves they didnt have to explain shit to anyone and if you disagreed with them that was your own fault so theyd just post an image macro making fun of you and that was the end of it they didnt go on endless campaigns across 4chan to force their opinion on the entire site    another difference i remember is that today it seems like theres no limit to how deeply you can attempt to analyze someones post the patterns and their motives but i remember literally being afraid to make posts like that on old 4chan because youd just be unanimously called a faggot by every side nobody wanted to see that kind of analytical meta shit anywhere it had a much more go with the flow feeling  theres more differences but these are what i miss the most about it modern 4chan just feels like social media babies climbing over each other competing for visibility of their posts and opinions
  le kek
  kinda a mix of /bant/ and /s4s/ in spirit but nothing can actually compare to old 4chan everything was for the sake of fun not outta bleak ironic cynicism like it is today
  thats not old 4chan
  read it all just to spite you
    please die
  i like this one or something similar i feel like in response to the misery brought by the nufags hardcore ironic nice/frenly posting is the next logical step of the forever contrarian 4chan who knows maybe its not even ironic
  i dont feel this is representative of all but a small group of posters  i really think itd be more accurate of overall 4chan if she was just represented as a super angry tryhard
  it would represent you well
  hey you leave jevin alone jevin is based
  are you illiterate or do you just have adhd it literally took me a minute to read it all good post
  kill yourself namefag stop attention seeking    off yourself too youre like a fucking tumor that wont die
  i joined in the 2006 habbo raids it was retarded and everyone was a teenager every other post was someone calling someone else a nigger faggot
  i was going to edit in just a pure square of black but yours is about the closest
  ur  this isnt instagram you retarded teenager
  dont reply to him
  dumb beekeeper roodiepoo
  ill filter him then
  there are archives of the textboards dating back to 2004 they might help shed some light on the early days of 4chan its difficult to find anything more than a handful of screenshots of the imageboards from this time period though
          haha jewin
  ron paul roody poo candy ass
  it was fucking shit but back then we had anymouse leeeeejon instead of /pol/tards
anomalous is region
    angry as hell sorry for triggering
this bothers me so much every time i see this image or any similar image   the  scale  is   all  fucked  up  meaning its probably completely illegitimate the 3rd and 4th panels should be combined to represent basically 2015 or 016 and that last panel shouldnt even be there   its like that oldfag scale pic the intervals get smaller and smaller as we approach the present which is fucking retarded if youre gonna have intervals you should understand that they shouldnt be munching up at the end like that or else intervals are actually probably totally arbitrary and made up on the spur of the moment not actually thinking about how to categorize and quantify timeframes
  016  2016  munching   bunching  angry typos
  see      4chins did its thing for the hell of it it was never about the memes jack it was about teh lulz
  its because oldfags and newfags dont perceive time in the same manner for oldfags its obvious that the last 3 pics are the exact same era but for newfags who havent experienced what 4chan used to be the slight differences are more noticeable
  assuming similar hardware and skill who wins leigon or /pol/
    legion of course /pol/tards are barely even human
  its fine now get in the rope
      where is the one where everything is filtered
  what is this from
  im sorry jevin ill never do it again 
  another even more cancerous wojack and pepe thats all 4chan is right now    if 4chan is t be saved pepe and wojack would need to be banned
shit what did jev get banned for now the spoiler tag petition is gone
  i think it has something to do with him 
  it was a cube
  that last edit was made by shills you know
  death
bring back /prog/
  this
  i thought i was on /mu/ for a second and got real excited  fuck programming
  no fuck u
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
this pls
frogposting should be mandatory on /prog/  after all the levenshtein distance of  frog and prog is only 1
  dumb progfoster
just go to tinychan /g/ is too dumb it would probably suck
hiro please
  t /wdg/ retard who thinks everyone else on 4chan also has a room temperature iq
make a new /frog/ board instead
me when i browse /prog/
  and ban frogs from the rest of the website
  just look at the catalog ffs people who were posting on /prog/ fucked off long ago
  frog website
  
is this image /prog/
  no thats /g/ /prog/ is for manly men only
  thats gay my dude
  no
do it faggot
  daily programming thread is more like the hourly programming thread  roughly a third of threads on /g/ are programming topics on average  where is hiro when we actually need him
  tfw no slow board to occasionally browse while programming
  uhhh you wouldnt like the /prog/ that was if thats what you want
instead of /prog/ we need /cg/  consumerist technology
  we need a board thats basically a safe space for npcs where you can go and be an npc without being judged or criticised
  but everyone on 4chan does have a room temperature iq
  room temperature iq  i like that im gonna use it its mine now
  296k
  but make it an image board this time if  can get their own board why not /prog/    even with just /dpt/ /wdg/ and /agdg/ you have a pretty big user base
  /wdg/ should not be allowed on /prog/  web dev is not programming  /agdg/ are too shit and should stay in v
  also ban toddler languages like python java and c
  ban things i dont like
  those are all certified brainlet pajeet languages  acceptable languages lisp scheme c assembly haskell idris agda
i had my doubts that cs undergrads were why /sci/ turned to shit but this thread confirms
  no i tested a few days ago borderline retard 127
  dont reply like youre me
おねがい
  wouldnt all the programmers moving to another board kill /g/
  to some extent  also if a new /prog/ came it would likely be too high pop to resemble old /prog/ which was essentially an incredibly sarcasting /g/jp/ hybrid that spent lots of time circlejerking about lisp and occasionally other esoteric languages that most people didnt know about because it was in the textboards
  we already have that its called reddit
  we  reddit
  no
happy いい肉の日 /qa/ i hope youre having a good one
happy what
  i seriously doubt that

  sorry im only a level 2 weeb i havent learned kana yet

  id eat senas meat

  doiuseaninternetbrowser
  sorry im only a level 2 weeb fuck you
sena is a good girl
  what are the criteria for being a good girl besides giving you a boner
  good grades nice very cute cares about her friends and their sisters
  very cute picture
   didnt get me anything relevant
is this the sena thread
  i really really wish sena was real and also my gf
  she can be    
  think ill buy this one already own two pillowcases but sena is special
  already own two pillowcases  would those two happen to be akari and megumin
  unfortunately no  ones ims and other is gochiusa
  oh cute    i want to get that sena one too but i havent yet
  im level 25 weeb i know kana but no kanji so i still have to put shit through google translate
i have a sena daki and two mousepads
might rewatch her anime
tfw no friends but big harem of sexy cute girls who fight over my dick
  i love sena so much
yukimura decided to leave the club and date kodaka with rikas approval since rika doesnt feel that way about kodaka  sena tries to help yozora confess but theyre too late and yukimura reveals theyre dating now sena is pissed because this isnt what would happen in a galge but yukimura goes life isnt a game i am a woman and all i did was what a normal person would do  yozora becomes senas new maid/butler  kate having gone fishing with pegasus all the time meets kodakas dad and falls totally head over heels for him so kodaka wont be her lover but her brotherfuck this shit  sena does confess to kodaka but thats the end of that story and he dates yukimura  something something student election kodaka is nominated by yukimura and is supported by the neighbors club against the viceprez someone else wins  kodaka is revealed as a virgin to the class and his reputation drops  yukimura proposes they go on a christmas date in order to commemorate a year of dating but offers to break up if he chooses the neighbors club instead kodaka is afraid theyll break up but yukimura and he go to the christmas party together and yukimura rejoins the neighbors club it seems more like yukimura was being considerate of his friendships when they went to the neighbors club party not that they actually broke up but that shell still be his girlfriend while also being part of the club
milk truck arrived
so how do you feel now that were officially a different website from 4chan the red boards cannot be accessed from this default interface anymore
i feel nothing
its not really a different website its just a different domain  its not like theyre separate entities
  stop anon god forbid having common sense
it feels great burning the bridge you behind is a wonderful sensation
i feel great now that im looking at an image of haruhi
i fucking hate having hair on my dick  its a fucking chore to pluck it you always miss a few hairs and they grow out fast as fuck  how can i get rid of it permanently without going to a clinic
based and redpilled
hot wax
/qa/ and i
no interesting meta threads weeks 46 and 47 were great but now the entire catalog is just shitposts
/qa/ doesnt exist to be interesting to you
  it also does not exist for spam but here we are
  the best part is how you think youre a good judge of these things
  i am free to be express my opinion also youd have to be blind to deny that most of the board is in a condition worse than it usually is
i wish i was a 2hu
same
weebs are mentally ill
    so you like getting fucked by men
  yes and girls too
  thats just what makes us so cool  and fun to be around
what is a 2hu

mods mods mods
  is this picture fucking real like the one with moot cumming on himself i cant tell anymore
is that hiro
/pol/ is the fastest board on 4chan how does this make you feel
  better it then /b/ desu
  even /adv/ and /cgl/ are better than /b/ at this point
  im completely okay with this
what happened bros years ago i was desensitized to the rudeness of this place and could take things with stride nowadays i legitimately feel bad being insulted in sincerity trolling gets on my nerves in a really grating way and im utterly fatigued at having to constantly pretend that im not bothered by anything and maintain an aloof sense of cool hiding behind irony in place of sincerity     i want to know what happened is it just me or is it the site or rather is it just the new people who are rude 24/7 because thats what they thought 4chan is supposed to be from what theyve heard in their internet rumors so they emulate this imagined reality as hard as they can    i just want some peace and quiet in the threads i do enjoy company with but there is no sanctity people just shitting everywhere being as rood and obnoxious as possible im so tired
  go to nice board  3
  these are the most diabolical trolls on the entire site  dont fall for the memes
i really think its that reputation 4chan built up as the asshole of the internet and there used to be breaks on boards between having heated arguments and insult wars where you could have a little relaxation period though people seem to have no idea how to b in any emotional state but constant anger on some boards and the popularity of 4chan has made it so that not even night time is safe from the constant anger      /s4s/ is a nice board but sometimes i feel as though its just ironically nice for me /qa/ outside of certain threads feels like the nicest board on the site at least that is if you fit in with the rest of /qa/
eternal september has come again things will never be the same there is a horrible price to pay beyond money and time wasted you must work to forge happiness now
  i can assure you than you are not alone if only you knew how much i understand how you feel in fact 99 of posts would make me feel like shit if i browsed many different boards but i dont anymore
  stop drinking sõymilk sõyboy
  you sound like a faggot
take the hehpill
  its especially the worst thing on certain boards where the worst most obnoxious posters bordering on spammers practically stalk the catalog to post in every single thread and in response to every single post about a thing he doesnt like its justi dont even know what words to describe what kind of disgust anger and contempt i feel towards those kinds of posters
  thats why its easier to stop seeing this garbage these people are not capable to enjoy something they are just braindead products of the modern internet spouting filth theyve soaked here without having anything alive inside let them rot further and try to find or create a small slow thread about something you enjoy on a board you didnt visit that much before just a friendly advice if you want to stay on 4chan at all
before 4chan was a mixture of uplifting discovery and miserable garbage the existence of uplifting discovery allows you to ignore the miserable garbage    but now that that theres nothing but miserable garbage you start to see it for the first time and how awful it is
  wait a minute that image
  discord trannies and twitter artists no thanks
  yes i thought as much i wanted to make sure it was just my memory failing me 4chan always had dicks but it was balanced with nice or fun posting too as long as you werent being a retard or obnoxious yourself now everyones a dick and nothing is pulling the scale back to balance it just keeps going down on one side
  i wanted to make sure it was just my memory failing me  wasnt  i notice im also making these grammar mistakes so fucking often these days too like literal memory lapses i type out a post read it reread it it makes sense everything seems there and then after i post i read it again just to find i fucking missed entire words    maybe my memory is failing or something
no board for old channers

hey 
  its not your imagination it is as you write
    dumb cynics
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
why is nintendrone censored on /v/ how come nintendofags get special protection
  you know why
  words dont get filtered to protect feefees they get filtered when spergy retards wont stop being spergy retards
  no i legit dont why arent other epithets censored what makes nintendo so special
  mods
  because nintendo fanboys arent as annoying and spammy as those that post nintendrone nintendo fanboys just want to discuss their platform sony and microsoft fanboys go autistic anytime anyone says anything remotely positive about nintendo
  because nintendo fanboys arent as annoying and spammy as those that post nintendrone    because a dozen smash/hes in threads up at any given moment for the last 3 months isnt annoying
  the point is those are genuine discussion posting the absolute state of nintendrones xdd isnt
  why arent other epithets censored  they are you fucking retard
  sonygger and pcuck are too
nintendrone is spamfiltered  nintenyearold and nintoddler are filtered to nintenbro  sonygger and sonypony are filtered to sonybro  pcuck is filtered to pcbro
  see clear nintendo bias nintendrones have 3 epithets filtered while sonyponies have 2 and pccucks have 1
  censoring those would also unintentionally censor genuine threads that happen to contain these words    protip use an asterisk instead of an apostrophe in the filter for hes in posting
  more like /v/ users arent smart enough to come up more than 1 epithet for pc users so there wasnt a need to filter more
the manchildren mods at /v/ are nintenyearolds
is forced no script captchas not working for anyone else on 4chna x fuck this shit
  and pcuck doesnt even sound like pc its terrible
  they dont retard
  ok this is big the neofag mod just lost it
  learn to contribute with respectable worthwhile replies
  im a proud pcuck
  isnt that word autofilter to nintenbro when posted
  contribute something worthwhile and quit parroting memes and insults that way youll never have to run across a word filter    unless youre trying to discuss the uss tariff on basedbeans i guess
because sony fans are the worst people on the board
  pcuck  yuck
  while kys boomer incel are still intact
  seething pcnigger
mom asks me if i knew what a nintendo switch was  ask why  her friend at work has an autistic son and he really wants one for christmas  it took all that i had to not laugh
  youre getting a nintendo switch for christmas
  i dont play video games seething nintentard
  t sneedposting reddit teen
  imagine your mom getting you a nintendo switch for christmas and then on christmas morning when you open the present you say to her i dont play video games seething nintentard and then she goes in her room to cry for 10 hours
  because a few years ago everyone spammed it so much that every other post in every thread was saying it
  im on a business trip in dubai i wont even be seeing my mom for another three months and we dont celebrate christmas
  theyre just filtered to sonybro and pcbro
is anyone streaming anything tonight i just kind of want to watch something random while chatting with some of you guys
  i guess i can if you want
  you dont have to unless you also want to
mods tend to ban people posting stream links  maybe you could ask on irc
  why would you ask this here instead of on a board that is known for regularly hosting streams
watching a stream with a board population of 7 users
  hey now im number 8 passing by
dammit weeb mafia you get banned for this here every weekend
not trying to advertise for luna projekt but the /r9k/apture folks have a streaming service thats regularly used by their little crowd for streaming video games series and random stuff  castssl
dont know
bump
is anyone else rangebanned from posting images but posts without images go through fine
zat a phone network or what
  id venture to say that /qa/ doesnt hear about range bans like that very often if ever you should probably contact mods on irc if you care that much
yes theres been some very screwy things happened to me lately and this is one of them  im getting upload failed with 4chan x though but maybe its in actuality a range ban for images it usually blocks me from making threads too
  the range bans have been screwy today for sure     mine just went away for images for what its worth
tries to post a regular image  doesnt work  try posting this  works like a charm  wtf hiroshima niggersaki
i cant do either i guess i should hop on irc and ask the mods
  god i wish that were me
same here using mobile att
  if youre on mobile try restarting your phone after i did that i can post images it might be different though since im on tmobile
  nope didnt work i guess att is fucked
  give it a few days or maybe hours seems to be inconsistent and random when they block image posting
  the jannies are going mad with power
  u r dumb   if ur on android go to this top sekrit page and yes
  how do you get there from about device
  easy mode just download this also pressing the first thingy and turning it off and on you can change ur ip within 2 seconds if that doesnt work try changing it to random preferred networks you will get new ip ranges due to 3g 4g and h networks play with it and you will figure it out
test
  holy shit thanks
    if i change the option on the top of pic related the rangeban still comes up
  how is this different from toggling airplane mode on and off
  nothing except for the network modes also its quicker than airplane mode if done correctly     cant help you u have different version than me
also you dont need that suspicious app to go to that screen just punch 4636 into your phone app  
my verizon ip is rangebanned even without images on /v/ but i was able to post on s4s while pooping at work just fine i wonder why its just specific boards
  yeah i have a feeling its specifically for blue boards that need to be mainstream so hiro can flood them with ads
i keep getting range banned on /int/ every few days
 here  i found out that it works if i run a ping test then set the menu to wcdma only
  yes its been this way since the switch
good ol american isps using different ip ranges for 3g and 4g for some weird reason
imagetest
  no its perfectly normal worldwide ipinfoio
    nevermind apparently its fixed
test
so still no way to fix this
  it is
paying to post images on 4chan    it begins
hiro is a nigger
  maybe it filters the file name
testing
  just like lmao
i cant even post a fucking osaka pic holy shit and yesterday i wasnt able to post at all fuck this gay ass gook jew
based hiro banning the phneposters
  anyone in australia getting this issue still
can anybody explain why yellow gook moot is able to get away with randomly range banning certain ranges in order to try selling 4chan passes
testing
testo
test
  so now at least i can post text but not images
  me too but on /g/ for example it works fine
  okay it seems i cant just start a thread then
  i tried to post one on /vg/ and couldnt will try a red board
  4channel images  range ban text is fine red boards 4chan  can post images
test
testingu
  i dont have an issue with this     what regions and carrier are u with
i still cant post pictures but seens like i can post text just fine
  be range blocked without a reason  range blocking doesnt work on /pol/  what the heck is this how do i fix this range blocked issue
    i have the same issue cannot post on any board including /mlp/ /v/ /vg/ and /vr/  now randomly i can post on /pol/ what is going on
all i know is at my workplace 4chan is blocked so i have to use my phone as a hotspot and /a/ rangebans most of the ips i get takes fucking ages sometimes to airplane mode it and find a working one but i havent been to work since 4channel went live so i dunno how its going up there and i cant test my phone right now because my house is pretty much in a fucking deadzone and i run off wifi    those same ips from my phone and hotspot that are banned from /a/ are not banned on /co/ and they are range bans because i get the op message instead of the one that used to say ip ip range or country

im 99 certain this is related to 4channel and advertisers images and especially thread ops are obviously the most visible part of 4chan
  no its because you retarded fucking phoneposters cant help yourselves and constantly post disgusting offtopic shit and ban evade or spam the catalog with airplane mode    no images means no threads no catalog flood no gorespam no pornspam etc consider yourself fortunate that youre allowed to post at all
  phone posters arent the problem and have never been the problem dumb newfag  spammers dont use their fucking phones to spam
  i have never spammed shit or posted from my phone and i still cant post pictures
  phone posters arent the problem   spammers dont use their fucking phones to spam  what the fuck am i reading
  it doesnt matter if you did its a blanket ban thank the ban evaders frogposters and spammers for ruining it for everyone
if you think about it the person whos getting all of these mobile ip networks imagebanned is really doing a service for the rest of us
  why hiroshima started isp banning phone networks  ive never had problems until now
  because people are maliciously exploiting dynamic mobile ips honestly it should have happened years ago posting is a privilege not a right
test
test 2
well looks like my ip range is unbanned
testing
i can post textonly on /v/  and i have full power on /qa/  i dont get it l honestly
  your isp is cursed somehow
  honestly it should have happened years ago  if moderation and administration actually cared it would have everything about phoneposting encourages people to post low effort garbage

  i have to wonder why /qa/ of all places getting this range post blocks
  same  fuck telecom arg i tried to post with images in 12 differents wifi and all are rangebanned  im probably the only faggot who use 4chan in my city so i surprised  t engrish text
test
  probably to help curb ban evasion by preventing you from making threads mobile posting is heavily abused to ban evade because its so easy
  what city my black friend i cant post images either and i tried in 2 different provinces
test
my home network was range banned from posting so i use my xfinity hotspot to post images via mobile
only op gets image posting banned you can image reply just fine
  looks like block is only on /v/
  nope it happens in all boards except /pol/   what the heck man
this is happening to me on my home network  not mobile network    this is 100 the result of this fucking gook testing the waters in relation to advertisers and 4chan pass sales
  not on certain boards cant post image replies at all on /vg/
testing
  did you try putting 4636 into your phone app and resetting the network  you could also try 27673855 it hard resets your ip and switches you to a different cell phone tower
  reading is hard right
  yes
uploading files from your ip range has been blocked due to abuse  seriously
why gookmoot

phonecancer is finally getting taken care of  wow this is probably the first time hiro has actually done something right
  test
  how retarded do you have to be to make a post like this
  theyre probably underage most people using 4chan are underage at least they are mentally
  except its not a phone thing
and unblocked again  didnt buy pass hiro    better luck next week
  test they blocked images for me
dogs rule  lolis drool
god i wish that were me
  which one

so when are we banning usa ips again its so tiring to have to consider thigs such as  feet for measurement  beer being stale and crap  soccer being the name for football  having terrible perceptions of anime  terrible political discussion  as a standard when no one else in the world shares those views    its as if you niggers werent even speaking english but some other american language
shut the fuck up faggot retard they should ban all non us isps like they did back in 06 or something maybe actually idk if that happened but im pretty sure they did europeans shit everything up with their banter xdd
i mean we could be speaking in english but if i said something like capital best fastfood restaurant or president you immediatly understand washington dc inandout or trump  without usa however youd think of your own countrys equivalent no longer orbiting around that countrys opinions no longer suffering from big turmoil every time something like the 2016 election happens down there much of the reason of why they fucked up 4chan is because many electionfags were potential voters or around them no longer being swarmed by the source of the likes of resetera or proudboys while the effect of the us may be felt all across the world here discussion of topics regarding that place would be as relevant as the australian elections
  all of that greentext you mentioned are features not bugs
why dont you go to a nonusa site if you dont want to deal with us
  rent free as usual
  the state of europoors
why are europests so whiney
if you cant name every single one of the memes in this image you need to leave

  who owns the sky was once a semipopular meme
  ironically soul soulless is an example of soullessness

  he thinks his newfag opinions matter
  im retarded for not recognizing moottan that was his early version before the more stylized one with a cat mask most people are familiar with if you are wondering about the face and the glasses is because back then people thought moot was this guy 
  fug
  you are missing emo duck waha and azu is osaka but i get you were probably referring to azumanga daioh
  your shitposting has never been funny stop forcing that goddamn meme
  but i get you were probably referring to azumanga daioh  yup its just ive never seen this show although its been on my backlog for ages
  who are you arguing with

  this is what gets me anime girls/boardtans used to be characters that were cute or acted in a peculiar way but that was usually not their defining feature in other words they were a complete character now 90 of them look overly cutesy to the point of being sickening and have no character or personality beyond the same westernised anime templates marketed for ironic weebs or zoomers who get their shit taste from youtube    also feel free to call my opinion shit
4chan city was uploaded 12 years ago today  what the fuck happened  
  all those on the far right were created by newfags/offsite anyway
  for me its the mcchicken the best fast food sandwich i even ask for extra mcchicken sauce packets and the staff is so friendly and more than willing to oblige    one time i asked for mcchicken sauce packets and they gave me three i said wow three for free and the nice friendly mcdonalds worker laughed and said im going to call you 3forfree    now the staff greets me with hey its 3forfree and always give me three packets its such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local mcdonalds restaurant i go there at least 3 times a week for lunch and a large iced coffee with milk instead of cream 12 times for breakfast on the weekend and maybe once for dinner when im in a rush but want a great meal that is affordable fast and can match my daily nutritional needs    i even dip my fries in mcchicken sauce its delicious what a great restaurant
  not a single pepe frog on the souless 4chan    pol cant meme
thanks for stealing my thread off of request asshole

  why would a black person be part of 4chan culture i thought we hated nibbas
säge
  oh god
  i didnt know about emo duck or recognize that depiction of moot until just now not an oldfag but read ed and saw a lot of 4chan memes reposted elsewhere on the internet used to call them maymays
  what sort of 20102013 memes did you like
god i miss cracky snacks longcat wryyy o rly pedobear
  the internet in general will never be this fun again  it hurts so much
ive been here since 2006 and i dont recognize anything in the upperright third
  longcat  the rei  road roller/wryyyyyyyyy  yotsuba  pedobear  anon  orly
  worst girl
  vivian james was protosoulless but still had soul
  i liked 20122015 desu wasnt old 4chan but still not quite nu4chan either
  because all of these memes are for newfags trying to act like oldfags
knowing thrust vectoring is the one and only true test of oldfagness fact
  not him but i mostly remember the mainstreamnesss first noticeable thing being each board being big enough to really have their own stuff rather than just /b/ but that was more of an 06 maybe even 05 kind of thing  most of those have kind of died out though unlike the super popular ones hell there are jokes from 6 years ago that i barely remember  and lots of it dealt with subjects where nothing was concrete
  the virgin on the left  the chad on the right
  you say that but more than half of them havent been used in years
  thats why you need to leave if you dont know them
  buuuutttt anon   i have no where else to go
  its weird seeing what gets referenced a lot today and what seems to have died out in memory mudkips and pools closed consumed the website tenfold compared to anything people complain about these days bleeding onto every board people reference less popular memes more often they dont reference stuff like get in the car or lazer charging at all despite them being just as popular as other stuff in their time
attempting to use memes as a gatekeeper was a mistake people go to ed or kym and learn all about memes but not a thing about being a good poster
  all of the ones on the right were soulless ebola chan was maybe the only one who was made on this site and vivian wasnt anime
  hol up /x/tan is practically the first board tan i call shenanigans
  i can name all these wojaks if you want op   left to right right to left eyes closed you name it
  how are you still on this site holy shit lol look back at your teenage self when you saw that meme and think about where you saw yourself at this point how horrifying
  this is a dumb image and it pisses me off theres much more to current memes even if you personally dont like them  you could add chadvirgin bane varg gondola apu sminem bogdanoffs that fucking banana for example
  face it 4chan stopped being the creative meme center of the internet a long time ago twitter instagram even reddit have better memes nowadays
  i came to this website because of the habbo raids on 2006 the fact that i could have so much fun all these years would probably make my teenage self pretty happy still i havent done much else in real life though
never forget to remember the old maymays like worded black box
teh rei
  oldest meme
what was emo duck anyway
  
  its funny that it makes me nostalgic for when the internet made fun of emo kids
cracky was more than a mere meme
  i came at the same time for the same reason so did most people i knew irl at the time largest influx of new users proportional to the amount of users around previously
  i dunno but you reminded me that duckroll was a thing and i dont even remember what it was exactly
if you dont know this man leave now
  i dont know who that is and im not going to leave
  lol who are all of these xd
  there was no quote hover or quote preview and crossthread quotelinks looked like every other quotelink so you could pretend you were replying to an interesting post in the thread and when people clicked to see what it was they would end up in your duckroll thread
  teh rei
  looks like a pedo to me
  i love you ebola chan
  im glad i joined in 2011/2012 and not later  also i recognize all in ops picture owing to reading lots of wikis and being interested in internet history eg 
why the fuck is osaka a meme
  too early for me to tell you firsthand but i think i read in a wiki page somewhere that people would post her having telephone conversations including with the bear who would become known as pedo bear this might be way off though can anyone who was actually here for that comment
teh rei
nullpo or something like i dont even remember what it is i just remember seeing it a lot does anyone know what i am talking about it might not even be from here but its driving me crazy not being able to fully remember help
  wryyyyyyy/za warudo was an ancient meme by the time i got here in 2008     also row row fight the powah
  googling it seems to indicate its a 2ch meme
  ring ring ring ring
bump
  you are right i kept thinking it was a /prog/ thing because google would bring up nullpointerexception but no its not even from here thank you for helping ease my mind though
  wtf is that date
  20th of june 2002
  it always bothered me that cockmongler had pronounced eyebrows in this fanart
  2ch memes in a vn but why
  why the fuck does moot look like that
  its before he transitioned
  old 4chan was aesthetic
what are your thoughts
i wanna kms
its not that cold yet where i live and honestly im thankful super cold weather is only enjoyable for the first two weeks then after that it kind of sucks
  i dont have thoughts
  everytime i try to post an image i get a message that ive besn range banned forcing me to post nothing but text for months i think that hiro gook is a massive faggot and hope he dies
my car is a steaming heap of shit and i had to reinstall my os last night but failed to back up my password archive because all my data is on different drives from my os so i forgot about it googles password recovery process is fucking ridiculous  write down your account creation date right now if you use them    so im thinking i should watch some varg videos and go live innawoods
i want to fuck with fat and tall nigga like derrick lewis
thinking about how thats one of the few nonapu frog images i approve of
  but in the place where i live has no boys like he
anybody can roast beef but nobody can pee
the dragons fire is extremely painful
there is even more steam when you piss yourself
go on /b/ right now mods playing sounds on the site
  why would you hurt me like this
  chu mean homie
  theres nothing of the sort
  so basically i looked at degeneracy for nothing
  theres literally a thread auto playing gabe
      
  holy shit when they said /b/ was infested with normalfags nowadays they werent kidding christ
  /b/ was normalfag since 2007 normalfag
these are your nurses for today
piece of fecal matter
  do you need to see a nurse
i want to do nasty night shift nurses things to the left and leave the other two alone
  ill take the other 2
you little scrotes will fap to literally any old drawing
  my favorite part of this image is chie casually leaving the bottom unbuttoned knowingly showing off her panties
i have many questions but who has the answers
im not sick

lolis lolis everywhere  and all of them are chink  lolis lolis everywhere  nor any pee to drink
  i should let you ladies know i dont have health insurance

  they are boats though and i am referencing the rhyme of the ancient mariner
my feet hurt i wonder when sakura starts her shift
  umm miss your panties are showing
how come younger idols are sluttier than older ones
  she isnt actually a nurse tomoyo just makes her dress like that
  that hospital must be really running low budget if they cant even afford pants for their employees i would seek healthcare elsewhere
  its rebelling against modesty
  how come she healed my heart then
  needles everywhere is this supposed to be sexy or scary
  needle play is the thinking man fetish
cute nurses
  tomoyo has some nice boobos

  can i share right
  left i want her bottom button open so hot
  you mean right
how do i post this  
trying something
i think 4chan rewrites gif files under certain conditions although i dont know under what conditions or with what program would be interesting to figure that out
uhhh
  interesting
  i thought maybe i could get it to post by editing the fields containing the dimensions but it did post and it wasnt the same
  some dumb fun mirrored face photo  is this supposed to be creepy
  the thread is lagging my 16gb ram computer spooky
did you find him
bump in case anyone else has ideas
clang a beautiful sound
indeed
when i think of true punk rock bands i think of nirvana
i think of hanatarash
  
misfits
  yeah they also drove a bulldozer through a venue wall once
  masonna  hanatarashi  
  soundwise sure but i dont think he even comes close in stage antics    masonna is most known for yamazakis wild live performances which usually consist of damaging his equipment jumping around madly and at times getting injured  vs  hanatarash was notorious for their dangerous live shows some of the bands most infamous shows included eye cutting a dead cat in half with a machete strapping a circular saw to his back and almost cutting his leg off and destroying part of a venue with a backhoe bulldozer by driving it through the back wall and onto the stage

theres a point where posting porn threads every second kinda ruins the random board at that point its not random anymore /b/ should be limited to two porn threads or a porn general its a random board not /porn/ they already have boards for that can hiroyuki enforce a porn general thread in /b/ so that there isnt 8 threads about porn hiroyuki please do something about this
this is unacceptable loli threads are being raided by retards spamming gore in them
  i mean porn is fine just keep it one thread or two at the most but to have the whole board cluttered with it is lousy moderation mods on b need to do their jobs
check the ban page of /b/  most of the bans are for being underage and spamming  
limiting what people can post would make it not random as well      /b/ only has a couple of rules illegal content bans dont get posted
  /b/ only has a couple of rules  the mods are allowed to ban whatever they want on /b/
  so why is it they allow loli on /b/ if they hate it so much they wont even allow it on /trash/
  its not limiting its a containment thread
  because thats still /b/ besides nobody in their right mind goes there anymore i suspect mods only answer reports when it comes to /b/
  go to /bant/ its shit but at least it has a no porn dumps rule
  ive reported enough /x/ and /bant/ threads on /pol/ to know otherwise
holy shit why do you care just use another board
  /b/ has been dead and buried for years i doubt theres a single old poster left in there  get over it
its another retarded site talks about 4chan episode  starring faggot redditors who probably do browse this site and shit up boards
how can thousands of users of a website be so obsessed about a handful of other websites
  if we reject gay people then why are so many ops faggots    c h e c k m a t e   l i b e r a l s
retarded site talks about 4chan  are you implying theres some social echelon between websites and youre unwilling to accept criticism from anyone of a lower caste  are you implying that if such an echelon existed you wouldnt be at or near the very bottom
reject gay anime fans
join the discussion  become a redditor
  wouldnt that be you since youre bringing that here
  honestly what can we do these people are worse than an annoying little brother that is up your ass and mimicking you 24/7
maybe i should scribble more again
  what can we do  its far too late for that theyre here to stay
  howd you find this op  i checked it out and theres a suprising amount of people correcting him in a nonretarded way  i find it very strange that they really use both 4chan and reddit
but anime makes you gay
  why does /r/4chan pretend to hate reddit
rejects gay people  has entire board for them
  on the one hand the moderators like to be cool and contrarian like the 4chan folks which they carry as their subreddit name and therefore like to shit all over their own place every time something controversial happens on reddit or something actually noteworthy happens on 4chan which is not too often the way existing moderators pick out new members based on fame and fashion is a bit as if you gathered e g all the namefags from s4s then gave them the power to run their own place  on the other hand the users of the subreddit are for the most part the typical redditor you might imagine which includes people that are either still too scared to visit the evil internet hate machine personally or got fed up with this place and only want to look at the lessshitty highlights of 4chan the comments on the average submission are so inane that you quickly come to the conclusion that not all of them can be ironic shitposting
  /lgbt/ is like /co/ its distinct from the rest of 4chan    like how /r/the_donald doesnt fit with the rest of reddit
    die retard
people here dont reject faggots more than they reject anything else some boards are even super faggy behind the scenes
i want a chinese girlfriend who smokes cigarettes nowwwwwwwwww    i dont care if im ugly  im  fucking  blonde    im made  i just  i want a smoking asian girlfriend hnnnnnnnnnnng    ill kek every goddamn chink in muh path the chinks dont deserve those literal goddess  and i dont want a fucking nerd chink girl    i want a chink girl that smokessss    i want cigarette smoke in muh face from a chinese girl  you heard me

the jumma buddhists are mongoloids native to the chittagong hill tracts cht and were independent of the bengal sultanate next to them they became princely states of british india separate from bengal the chittagong hill tracts were 97 buddhist in 1947 but the british decided to include the chittagong hill tracts in east bengal east pakistan east pakistan became bangladesh a majority bengali sunni muslim country    pakistan dumped excess muhajir sunni migrants from india in the cht leaving the cht at 90 jumma buddhist and built the kaptai dam for electricity which led to 100000 jumma buddhist and hajong hindu refugees fleeing to india    after independence from pakistan bangladeshi leader ziaur rehman started the genocide in 1977 flooding the cht with bengali sunni muslim settlers and started killing and rape campaigns against jumma buddhists to make the cht into a majority bengali sunni muslim land jumla buddhists are now 35 and bengali sunni are now 65 of the cht the bengali sunni colonial settlers are rapists    jumma buddhists started an insurgency to fight back from 19771997 they were called the shanti bahini the jumma buddhists would behead rapist sunni settlers and leave their corpses floating in the rivers            bangladeshi army and settlers are still attacking and destroying jumma villages raping forbidding jummas from talking to western foreigners and journalists without bengali soldiers watching
  there are jumma buddhist monks who want to reform the armed shanti bahini and fight the bengali sunnis again                                                          
  the bengali sunni muslim settlers attempt the same in assam and nagaland but were beaten back myanmar ruled assam before 1826 but after the treaty of yandabo in the first anglo burmese war the british annexed assam and arakan from myanmar    the british wanted to grow tea in assam so they imported dravidians to grow tea they then needed rice to feed the dravidians so they imported millions of bengali sunni and bengali hindus to grow rice in assam and arakan the native hindu assamese like the caucasian brahmins and mongoloids like the ahom bodos and lalung were furious the hindu assamese natives dont have problems with moderate assamese sunni muslims but they hate the extremist radical bengali sunni immigrants for being terrorists and bengali hindu immigrants for threatening their language and ethnic identity    assamese hindu natives rioted against bengali hindus in the 1980s for trying to make bengali language official the assamese natives then killed thousands of bengali sunni invaders in mass battles in 1983 2008 2012 and 2014 the bengali sunnis started tje violence by demanding their own muslim autonomous region on native assamese land and raped and murdered native assamese girls the assamese ahom bodo and lalung responded by killing thousands of bengali sunni terrorists    a bengali sunni immigrant in neighbouring nagaland raped a naga woman in 2015 and then the native mongoloid nagas lynched the bengali sunni to death
  the lynching of the bengali sunni rapist by mongoloid nagas in 2015 happened in dimapur indian sunnis tried to riot all over india in 2012 by atracking all mongoloid looking people from northeast indias seven sister states sikkim nepal and tibet after the bodo hindus killed dozens of bengali sunni terrorists in battle in bodoland the mongoloid bodo hindus responded by killing dozens of more bengali sunni terrorists in 2014 to show what would happen to indian sunnis if they tried to chimpout    the bengali sunnis in assam sought help from the muslim brotherhood and alqaeda and asked them to declare jihad against assamese and naga natives    assamese hindus have demanded all bengalis sunni and hindu since 1826 be stripped of residency and deported back to bangladesh india has decided in that direction recently to strip millions of them of citizenship and deport    the hindu mongoloids and buddhist mongoloids of assam tripura arakan and other neighbours have long defeated sunni muslim invasions    hindu mountaineers in himchal pradesh slaughtered the 10000 strong sunni turkic invading army of muhammad bin tughluq in the qarachil expedition in 1333    tibetan buddhists slaughtered the 10000 strong sunni turkic invading army of bakhtiyar khilji in chumbi valley in 1206 khiljis turkic sunni muslim army tried to rape buddhist women but instead were slaughtered by the buddhists until only khilji was left alive khilji screamed in horror and fled back to bengal alone where he died in terror weeks later    the hindu mongoloid tai ahom in assam defeated the mughal turkic sunni invading armies and slaughtered them maintaining assamese independence    the hindu mongoloid tripuris regularly defeated the sunni bengal sultanate invasions and annexed chittagong city they massacred bengal sultanate armies    the mongoloid rakhine buddhist kingdom of mrauku ruled in arakan and defeated the sunni bengal sultanate raiding into dhaka itself
    i didnt want to include racial shit like mongoloid or caucasian but some people think all hindus are caucasian this is the reason race is labelled turkic sunni invaders from central asia themselves were mongoloid          the rohingya in arakan myanmar are descendants of bengali sunni muslims brought by britain to farm rice after annexing arakan from myanmar in 1826 the natives of arakan are rakhine buddhists native buddhists in myanmar dont have a problem with moderate myedu sunni muslims kamein sunni muslims or hui panthay sunni muslims but they hate rohingya bengali sunni extremist terrorists influenced by wahhabi bengali faraizi movement wahhabi najdi ikhwan and alqaeda rohongyas tried to claim rakhine buddhist land in arakan as sunni bengali land and declare an islamic state in 1948 before myanmar defeared the rohingya in operation monsoon even hui sunni muslims in myanmar dérogatorily call rohingyas and indian sunni muslims kalar and view them as extremist dont like praying in the same mosques as them and do not intermarry with them hui sunnis build separate mosques in myanmar from indian sunnis and hui sunnis accuse indian sunnis of spreading fundamentalism extremism and terrorism    bengali sunni chimpout the noakhali massacre and rape of thousands of bengali hindus by bengali sunnis in 1946 direct action day in calcutta led to partition violence    the british also promised independence to the jumma buddhist princely states in the chittagong hill tracts during world war ii for the jumma buddhists being proally but in 1947 radcliffe drew them into east pakistan later bangladesh
  the kamata koch behar and koch hajo were hindu kingdoms in the same region which fought off the sunni bengal sultanate hindu tripura and buddhist mrauku easily defeated the bengal sultanate the hindu kamarupa kingdom in assam helped fuck bakhtiyar khilji by letting him through to chumbi at first but blocking and fucking his return route the assamese and nagas refer to bengali sunnis as miya while rakhine and burmese refer to bengalis as kalar the koch dynasties were founded by the hindu koch rajbongshi people      the local northeasterner assamese sunni muslims and manipuri meithei speaking sunni muslims arent the same as mainland indian muslims on the other side of the chickens neck siliguri corridor the assamese hindus have no problems with the local moderate northeasterner assamese sunni muslims and mongoloid manipuri meithei hindus had no problem with moderate manipuri meithei speaking sunni muslims but they have a big problem with radical bengali sunni muslims and with the mainland beyond the chicken neck indian sunni muslims the radical mainland indian sunnis support the bengali sunni illegals and the northeasterners hate the radical extremist mainlander indian sunnis and bengali sunnis but not their own moderate assamese sunnis and manipuri sunnis        burmese and rakhine buddhists have no problem with moderate local myedu sunni muslims kamein sunni muslims or hui panthay sunni muslims but they hate radical extremist mainlander indian sunni and rohingya bengali sunni migrants to myanmar who came in the british colonial rule hui sunnis in myanmar dont like the indian sunnis either they view them as extremist and spreaders of terrorism and having a dirty culture and call them kalar which is an insult hui sunnis in myanmar say indian sunni imams and mosques spread evil terrorist ideas among the sunni muslims
  the jumma buddhists in the cht werent given a choice to declare independence sir cyril radcliffe drew them right into east pakistan since he said the jumma buddhist chittagong hill tracts should go with bengali sunni majority chittagong port even though they have nothing to do with each other than beginning with the same name they were not given a choice to declare independence this wasnt kashmir or hyderabad the three jumma buddhist kingdoms chakma circle bohmong circle mong circles in the cht were considered quasi princely states on a lower level than the main princely states who were given the option of the independence the jumma kingdoms were given absolutely no say in the matter no independence no choice of even joining india or myanmar they were put into east pakistan by radcliffe unilaterally the british partitioned india and upon partition withe line drawn by the british pakistan and india became independent states india did not declare independence as a unified state and divide itself the british radcliffe did the hack job of drawing the borders
  these sunni islamists are inciting against buddhism and whining about rohingyas                     
  
      soldiers rape and assault marma girls in chittagong hill tracts        suffering of jumma tribes continues 20 years after peace accord        bangladesh hundreds of jumma houses torched by settlers  as army and police stand by          attacks on jummas continue despite government promises        massacres in the chittagong hill tracts              
  jumma villagers flee the attack chittagong hill tracts bangladesh
why do people fight over land that floods every year during the monsoon season
  chittagong hill tracts are highlands not lowland plains or delta
  well that explains one of the reasons why they fight over it today i learned something its ironic that the the roles between the buddhists and muslims are reversed in the myanmar/burmese crisis just a few thousand kilometers to the east of that region if i had my way i would put them all on a ship and send them to mexico until they figure out an amicable solution but you and i both know the leaders of these countries/regions are only going to continue the status quo until the pressure makes something crack
  bengalis are migrants and invaders in both lands because they dont know about population control
  explain to bengali sunnis the benefits of not overpopulating their country until it turns into a shithole so they try to invade other lands and fail
tell us more
  they cant understand
necrospam
  nice flag
  we make war so that we can have peace
this has everything to do with /qa/
why not genocide bangladesh its so densely populated and small
genocides are typically done to distract the working class from economic/social hardship rather than revolt against their leaders jews armenians tutsi the main bringer of the masses being lead to genocide was a distraction against the failings of the capitalist system
  genocides were regularly occurring for thousands of years before capitalism even existed you pseud sidewalk dog turd
  global warming will make the entire bangladesh dissappear except for the chittagong hill tracts because the entire country is the low lying ganges delta
  cant imagine the refugee crisis that would cause

what sites got the worst posters/commenters on it im inclined to believe its youtube even with reddit and other screenshots of boogeyman websites im always amazed by how much worse the comments on most any semipopular youtube video are
wait before you try playing some old ass online fps with literal boomers dods is a good example
some porn site probably like motherless or something
on liveleak and gore sites people are pretty retarded too
worldstar  gelbooru  /qa/
  this bestgore has to be the absolute number one website in terms of comment retardation  youtube and reddit feel like heaven in comparison
4chan
  pornhub
this is a 2018 comment on a video about visualized sorting algorithms
  you do realize that the dislike button doesnt do shit on youtube
  i know but i press it anyway just because

  i dont get it do you speak english
4channel needs to have its own worksafe version of /b/    4chan has always needed a worksafe /b/ anyway
theres like what 6 different random boards  /b/ /r9k/ /trash/ /vip/ /s4s/ /bant/    7 if you count /qa/ i guess
  just make /s4s/ or /bant/ a blue board and move it here most of /s4s/ posts are pretty innocuous and /bant/ is completely useless so a change in topic would make it a bit more interesting
  both of em should be blue
/tv/ i guess its not work safe though
  a work safe /b/ for people to discuss random things and make memes its essential the /lounge/ board you find on other chans
youre on it right now
  you wish
/v/ is like the original blue /b/  just go there
  there is already one besides /b/ is just a containment board
  current /b/ is just normalfags creepshot porn /soc/ spillover and decade old reposts  but worksafe /b/ wouldnt /b/e the same because it goes against the zomg no rules theme  you cannot win
keep that /qa/ spirit  be bold  never discuss meta
  why are you here at all
yeah call me groovy  cuz when all the boys run out  spams going worse than a sandler movie  yuh i aint about that shit cuz meta is for fags and niggers that are legit  frogs cower when my autistic volition governs the spit  im the realest the hardest the strongest the craziest whoop your ass a whole new hole with my /qa/ fist so much that they call me fascist  but i aint about acting tough no  i aint those generic thugga grindas  slimy limmas nugget tryina  imma stand up and we gon rise up  against the fleeting meta threat  cuz it drive me insane  they say it just cold sweat  but it sink worse than bane  im paranoid freud was right  but it drive me on steroids with a bit of might  to put yo metawhining bitches on hemorrhoids  yuh cuz when they push me out of the wime and the dime they dont think im gonna grind to the shine yuh  so expect me at your doorstep  yeah niggas thinking im like a roulette  nah i take my chances where theyre set  so you frogs better respect    im out
bump because this is woke
  fuck off weeb
first megumin and now jevin i know youre a prude but youre a no fun guy too come on leave those jevin posts alone they werent harming anyone
the great purge of /qa/ has begun
it was so nice here without you
these board personalities are pretty retarded 2bh
what did he do i couldnt find any obvious jevin bans on archives or verniy
its hard to tell with desu search down but i know that the petition to add spoilers to /qa/ is not here on in the on site archive and this post is gone   maybe someone pretended to be jevin and then got those posts deleted but even so i dont think that its appropriate to delete all the posts made under the name of jevin
id rather have you people leave /qa/ alone than the mods
is normal that when i put my glasses if feel nausea and headaches im new with these ones
i have seen other people have similar problems with new glasses
  is this normal  it really gets worse with the time
  no its not did you pick them up from some store or were they prescribed they could be the wrong ones for your eyes also wrong board this board is for complaining and shitposting youre looking for

  i dont know what to tell you man ive never had any of those symptoms and id had my glasses since high school

trap manga ads are popping up
  source forced feminization is my fantasy
  he uses the browser for 4chan  stupid nigger
  literally in the ads name kek
  good thing we banned nsfw content
adgaurdapk for phones has successfully installed
  these there was a time when they werent malware garbage      disgusting absolutely disgusting
remove nws boards from the site   start advertising nws content
    is that twelve kingdoms on the banner
  thats fucking tg not trap  disgusting
  lifelike texture _
i it just me or have there not been any 4chan banners in a long time
i made a thread earlier but got ignored
  because you have a trip most likely
they would be cancer if made today mobile posters dont see them anyway unless they use landscape mode also plenty of them break copyrights id sooner expect them to be deleted
  hiro has deleted many of them so its obvious he doesnt care about them
  i dont think hiro deleted any moot removed that one and others in an effort to clean up the site
why bother it would just be some passcuck vote thats rigged to the most safe and boring shit ever
  in an effort to clean up the site  if thats all that was done and many more nsfw ones remain i wouldnt even want to sit next to his stink because he probably wouldnt even know how to properly clean up his own ass  like how hard can it be to understand gr5
  no ive noticed some of the other banners have been removed
  what nsfw banners are there
  shinjis masturbation one numerous with the word faggot or fag one /pol/ banner with dorner merchant and moot what would the world be without friends  im afraid they may be removed in the future
  anyway anon i think there wont be for some time because a lot of the newest banners were created in 201314 most of which arent even all that were accepted     i remember there were way more in 2013 in particular i think some one mentioned back in the day that there were around 15 spongebob banners 9 tomoko and a shitload of nichijou
i dont even have banners enabled anymore
unless theres been something since i think the latest banners are the something happened windows one and im glad there is no stupid 4chan users with the awful neon pink font
    banners are not deleted the set in rotation however does periodically change
ting ting                                                                                                      ahem                                                    i have an announcement ladies and gentlemen i have an announcement

can someone please spoon feed me on why we have so many janny haters as of late they do their job for free i dont see the reason to hate
the recent surge in janny posting is an inside job being perpetrated by the jannies themselves in a misguided attempt to persuade gookmoot that 1 jannies have a purpose and are useful for cleaning trash threads that they themselves create and 2 jannies deserve monetary compensation for all the work they do and all the abuse they receive all of which surreptitiously manufactured by the jannies themselves in order to preserve their lame as fuck nonjobs the jannies are clearly drunk on the minuscule amount of power that they wield and theyre willing to lie cheat and steal to get more hiro if youre reading this dont fall for it these kikel wannabes dont deserve even a single solitary yen from you
looks at the camera and smirks  look at that guy amirite  laughter is heard from all directions at a fixed volume
audience stars to applaud
what the fuck is /vg/s obsession with reddit ive seen it on every board as long as reddit existed but /vg/ especially over the past year or so the use of reddit as an insult has just skyrocketed you cant go to a thread without seeing it plastered in every other post   is it literally just redditors getting here at getting pissy that every post might be one of them and they wanna be in a sekrit le fourchyon club what the actual shit
reddit reddit reddit reddit
  reddit reddit reddit reddit  it feels like that sometimes   i guess its my fault for going to /vg/ expecting to talk about games but i wish we had more jannies cleaning up all that shit is clearly too much for the amount we have
    i think its honestly just shitposting unless the thread in question has a reason for not liking reddit        it obviously depends on the thread but /vg/ seems a lot better than /v/ to me
  i dont know man most of those posts feel too angry to be just shitposting but maybe its just me misinterpreting them calling each other redditfags and telling each other to go back and kill themselves
  /r/4chan is actually kind of based
/vg/ and /v/ are for shitposting only
  where on the internet can i have quality discussions about video games
  i wonder
  fuck you    in /v/ and /vg/ every so often
its the buzzword that newfags think makes them fit in
    /v/ was never good just use reddit or the publishers forums
  we believe its shitty destructive echo chamber that does much more public harm than anything 4chan has ever done we thing it discourages communication and encourages passive addictlike consumption  thats rich considering 90 of my past 15 years on 4chan can be summed up to being called nigger faggot or autistic by some dipshit who thinks the earth revolves around him so people can only say what he wants to hear
  shadowban those toxic narcissistic problematic douchecanoes
  i realized not long ago that a sizable portion of this website really does use reddit i remember once someone on /v/ tried to give me the winkwink nudgenudge about it like haha yeah i know were all using reddit in here but fuck reddit amirite xd and people agreed with him shits infuriating
  /v/ was never good just use reddit or the publishers forums  theres really nowhere to fit in  /v/ is full of prepubescent cunts focusing their impotent rage into incoherent screeching making mountains out of molehills just because they can  reddit everyone is so obsessed with being perceived as smarter than everyone else that literally every post is just oozing with pseudointellectual narcissistic attempts at one upping one another by trying to subtly insult eachother without being banned  official forums are just a bunch of virtue signalling cunts being overly polite because theyre scared shitless of being downvoted or suspended because they said sorry dude to a female  i just want a site where i can discuss vidya tell retards to fuck off but not have a faggot derail the whole thread with his 60 post meltdown without getting banned
  fuck you  hes right tho thanks to moot /v/ is like /b/ only with video games now
  ive literally been calling it /b/lite for years always thought the only proper step is disolve /v/ because its not needed its just a blue board /b/ and you already have boards for retro game and for videogame generals announce that /v/ is being merged into /b/ instead of just removing it then take all the /v/ jannies and mods and move them over to /vg/ then use forced post id in /vg/ and have mods enforce the rules completely  the simple fact is that as it stands now move to 4channel isnt going to mean much you can get temporary new ads from people that fall for the name change but thats gonna go down the drain pretty quick when they see the kind of content on side and lets be frank 4chan right now is /b/ and a bunch of /b/lite boards
  wouldnt help /vg/ theyre currently being completely overran with gacha bullshit
  gacha you mean cellphone games
  yeah slower generals are being ran off the board if they dont bump for 1030 minutes during peak times
    i probably should have said that the practice too probably depends on the thread its hard to tell in /fgoalter/ threads to tell who is calling out someone for using terms associated with reddit and who is just shitposting said term could also have been used purposefully to shitpost
  its obvious just from a numbers perspective it makes sense since reddit has like 100x the users that 4chan does all the memes and leaks and stuff all get posted to reddit before 4chan /tv/ is just blatantly full of people posting gamersriseup memes and then turning around and going go to back reddit some people post here with the attitude that reddit is for discussion and 4chan is for mindless shitposting
  i have the mistfortune of liking shit games so i was in destiny and division generals and shit gets so bad sometimes you genuinely want to line up some of those people and just pull the trigger till the ammo runs out you know i just wish for a bit more people on the mod/janny team
  it really wasnt so bad before 2016 i dont give a shit about politics but i really wish that the stormfronters hadnt decided to bring every retard on the internet into their fucking meme war are we doomed to have an influx of 16 year olds who refuse to assimilate every 8 years or something
  when it comes to video games i think its probably just a matter of the overall community being garbage itself /v/ has fallen in love with the idea that its the best judge of quality and that they expose games for being shit which amounts to calling every game shit and then taking the ones that turn out to be not as good as evidence of the boards intelligence
  /r/games
  
  thats because for all its flaws reddit is still objectively better than what 4chan has become my gripe about the crossover isnt even with redditors on 4chan its with chan tards on reddit who dont leave their redcap incel bullshit here where it belongs
    piss off        at the very least /v/ used to be a lot better than it is now it probably needs /a/ levels of oversight to get better
  fuck off its an apples to oranges comparison posting over there is what gives your text that disgusting smugness that seeps from the insincerity of your posts not to mention the desperation youve accumulated in needing to posture to your internet friends to gather the shallow validation that gives your life meaning youre oversocialized underdeveloped and a semenslurping megafaggot overall just like everyone else who feels the need to come over here from your shithole of a website fuck you
  /vg/ is easily one of the worst boards where /v/ mostly just shitposts with whatever /vg/ circlejerks over shitposting video games they practically compete with each other over how hard they can shitpost them if all the shitposters and trolls were banned from /vg/ i bet the population would drop by 70
  redditors shit up the threads and constantly steal shit from whatever general they go to
  thank you for proving him wrong the circlejerk hugbox is the worst thing about reddit on 4chan you can still call a faggot a faggot without your post being hidden by the community
  its more pevalent in /g/
  reddit stole our memes in 2011 and retards have hated it ever since even after the cesspool called twitter ruined the internet
  thats a fair point but on reddit this person can literally dictate the narrative if other people agree with him here your voice is more or less as loud as his regardless how many agree with him well at least in theory
  discussion is not possible on reddit by design the design of leddit leads to highlighting popular opinions or witty one liners not discussion contrarianism is stifled vehemently conditioning users into uniformity on the other hand that you will find plenty on leddit
  /vg/ its not perfect but it should work use the report function even if it seems pointless filter avatarfags or annoying phrases etc add this to your filter under comment  /n2/  it will filter out all double space posters ledditors
  what about faggots
  this 100  fuck redditors and fuck them good
  just use the filter for images catchphrases etc for anything else that is against the rules  report its really not that hard
    discussion is not possible on reddit by design     its not really possible here either just for different reasons      contrarianism is stifled vehemently     ive come to the conclusion that most of the people who say that are butthurt trolls and /pol/tards who get mad they only get downvotes not yous knee jerk contrarianism doesnt add anything to the discussion and if you want unpopular opinions you can always sort by controversial     conditioning users into uniformity on the other hand that you will find plenty on leddit    here as well but more so at least on reddit everyone from tankies to neonazis can make their own subreddit to rule with an iron fist so theres actually more diversity of opinion site wide       good point i think on average more of reddit has a healthy active sex life than here
  lolno actually i went over there a couple of years ago because i got fed up with idiots like you taking over 4chan
  retard      correct
  4chan the problem is probably you if you cant find quality discussion here on any topic
  resetera unironically if it didnt have an accountneeded to participate shit id leave this shithole called /v/ in an instant but then again if it didnt whatd stop it from becoming another /v/ so i understand it
  that sounds fine on paper but in reality the mob mentality is so much worse on 4chan because a person can so easily samefag and everyone loves to pile on on the losing side on reddit at least he would have to get people on his side in /v/ they dont even have to like him theyll support him just because they think itll annoy you
  it will filter out all double space posters ledditors  double space is the way people originally posted on 4chan before reddit was even a thing stop trying to sound edgy
  this is incorrect
  i once got 4 consecutive warnings for reporting spam
  spacing your posts like this should earn you a permaban you have no right to speak of the negatives of 4chan/nel as you dont belong here mongrelnigger
  the problem is probably you if you cant find quality discussion here on any topic  see and its cunts like this that make it insufferable to actually try and hold a conversation
  using spacing thats been on 4chan from day 1 should be permaban
  then go back there fag
  complaining about le reddit spacing should be a permaban
  dont need to with browser tabs i can be in both places at once
  the thing about 4chan is that quality discussion is rare but when it happens its as comfy as it gets just ignore retards and look for good threads
this site as a whole is obsessed with reddit not just /vg/
  i applied for janny/mod a bunch of times but never got accepted good thing too i guess because i swear to fuck if i was one id hit every muh reddit post with full extent of whatever power was given to me
  they dont want people who can do the job they want people who suck up to them
  ill suck all the admin dicks they want me if they give me the power to wipe this trash off the face of 4chan
  thats not enough you need to have their opinions on everything to the letter that means doing nothing to actually make the website worksafe
  theres a reason every single mod and janitor feels like the same soulless robot and why the website is equally bad on every board    they dont look for people who can do the job properly they look for people like them
reddit reddit reddit reddit reddit reddit
      feels more like that are only a handfull of them and they all moderate only on weekend
  not to me im always here and i see moderation of sorts 24/7 sometimes more sometimes less but always the same type of content gets left behind far longer than it should and often gets archived    and ive basically given up reporting anything because they just clear all of your reports and ban you when you report their porn i dont even report illegal things anymore if they dont want to do their part to make this website good then neither do i
  yeah maybe but that hasnt happened since 2015
  go back to the last few years of destiny general in /vg/ and tell me if you still believe that i fucking dare you
  you wanna know why people laugh at you when you say reddit spacing  reddit hasnt required double space to linebreak in over a year
  go back to redit you fucking fag
  crying about something on 4chan  newfag
  064350    064451
  you
  054350    054451    054550  samefag
  54451 to 54550 is 59 seconds even without image it wouldnt be possible samefag and with image repost timer is 90 seconds
  he doesnt know  newfag assblasted at getting exposed on his newfaggotry
  fuck reddit
because reddit has actually infested /vg/  for example im on /mhg/ daily and i saw someone posting a picture of a monster decide to google reverse it because why not and i found it being posted to reddit believe it or not but its true   also some guy said how an armor set would look pretty nice that was really niche next morning at work when i was browsing rddit i do this because its easier to explain than 4chan i saw a fucking picture of that exact set
which board has the most welladjusted people on it is there one board on here that has a high amount of respectful mature and intelligent individuals
/j/
    bbut anon thats not a board
  i guess youre not well adjusted enough to access it then   but you can always test to see if you are  
    damn guess im not
youre posting on it right now just ignore the two schizos
    
  good joke    probably /out/ or /trv/
  no
/diy/ is overall pretty constructive and respectful about creating all kinds of things
welladjusted people  
  ancock  ck is still iffy but theres good discussion  most hobby boards are safe and have mature posters
god i wish that were me
  short drop strangled to death    no you dont what you do is jump from a great height and have the rope snap your neck
  now thats a real goal something you can accomplish
wow you must be desperate to keep shilling your merchandise on this board how much money did you blow on the shirts how many more do you have to sell to break even
  i made a killing on these theyre v popular and comfy to wear
nice
interesting
bunp
why the fuck is there no navigation options anymore i want to put all the boards back on top    why the fuck are you so fucking incompetent gook
because your settings didnt transfer over to 4channel and youre too stupid to change them
will i ever find love /qa/
you dont have time you are married to /qa/ you cant get enough
love is nothing but a case of mistaken identity
love was invented to sell shitty hallmark cards and chocolate    wish this whole world would burn to ash
probably not god punished us for our misdeeds
can someone here explain the porncensorship laws in japan    if you post/draw uncensored porn do you get fined do you get prosecuted in any way do they make efforts to remove your art or does nothing happen at all and is it illegal to possess/share uncensored porn for no monetary gain or is it only illegal to sell it  i know a lot of japanese artists that censor their porn but i also know a lot that dont give a fuck so it confuses me
death by 1000 cuts
not censoring porn is like not reporting income if you do it a little bit youll probably get away but the more you do it and the more money it makes you the more likely youll be penalized
  interesting
dont watch porn
the artists should just hop to a more free country and sell their merch from there but i guess the retarded japanese nationalism prevents them from accepting artwork that didnt originate from japan and inundate the corrupt yakuza run government
  the artists should just hop to a more free country and sell their merch from there  it would be illegal to import it
  well i guess the yakuza will get their cut regardless
  why are you so obsessed with the yakuza
how many prosecutions have there been
you just keep on usin keep on usin keep on using me  until you use me uuup
  shut up
  the corrupt yakuza run government  this is what retarded westcucks believe lol japan is perfect in everyway
dirty thoughts are bad
how the frick is feels/brainlet posting legal let alone sfw
what do you propose
  im asking because it is blatantly a form of psychological warfare fearmongering and manipulation    people keep talking about selfmoderation whatever that is so heres a solution    the reason this true king of cancers is around is because they have simulated the feel of actual posting on 4chan when they are indistinguishable from spam robots    feelsshitheads do everything on purpose they have an ulterior motive with every key they press and button they click all stemming from their own infantile brutishness    thus my suggestion is to hoist them by their own petard let there be a  4chan happenings  feels/brainlet edition general where we post screencaps of feels posts on 4chan and then clinically clinically analyze their posting manner content and intent with a magnifying glass like holding up their posts to science to show how baffingly insincere they are    the reason this will work is because their foundation for poisoning the well has always been the propaganda that they are not fags they are bros they are not here to shitpost they are here for banter they fit in without trying to they can easily be exposed for the malevolent creatures that they are and the hostile environment they produce if we critically examine various collected feels posts and ask out loud what possible reason could they have for posting this way
so hows the proposal who wants to participate
proud bump
its not inherently nsfw but that doesnt mean it isnt usually garbage that needs to be taken out
has there been a perceptible change in the speed of boards i honestly hope this place dies so im no longer tethered to here    and is this board split indicative of jmoot not being able to sustains 4chans costs or that jmoot wants profit over anything else
some people say its getting slower but then others with traffic stats say those people are imagining things
  but do you think that the split is a clear sign that 4chan cant sustain its costs or that jmoot is a greedy bastard
  up until recently it probably could but since stripes banned it i dont know it seems unlikely in any case it doesnt make much money at the moment
i guess we are all counting on hiro being innovative in finding funding sources without pissing off too many users with malware

where do you think you are right now
  it still persists even if barely i want dead completely
why do non/qa/ boards have so many normies
  because redditors think theyre welcomed here  they are not

  the name change is distributive    have you ever studied mathematics
if this was reddit you could downvote it
  have you ever studied mathematics  no
  the name change is assonant have you ever studied english
  chucks fuck and suck sounds like a brothel what kind of feed  seed store would advertise that

so you know how when you are surrounded by people be it at a social gathering shopping for groceries or just waking on a street your eyes tend to wander to the best looking girls around to their faces their physique maybe you rate them     during this last few years im over 30 now ive found myself checking out women of all ages i would have normally ignored even when i was a horny teen like today i was waiting in line and couldnt help but thinking how the cashier would look in other clothes which led me to lewder thoughts she was a rather plain looking middle aged women but apparently now that does it for me not being outright ugly and having at least one enjoyable trait im now able to overlook any flaws i previously fixated upon im unsure if this is a gift or a curse    i thought my libido supposed to decline with age but i found myself lusting after more and more accesible women i was wondering if someone has anyone experienced something similar
  yes
  what a forced and stale meme ive never seen a boomer much less one drinking monster

women are overrated

what was 4chan like in 20032006 and what made it different than current 4chan  inb4 this image
reposting/spamming
funposting  spamming  tripfags  more spam  even more spam
  what was your favorite spam
  2006  bush is president  2011  2016  obama is president   2018  trump is president
  i feel like i just answer these constantly so apologies if my reply isnt particularly detailed or extensive    nobody took anything seriously  everyone understood that everyone was joking and so posting shocking things/dark jokes didnt lead anyone to use that post to reflect on you as a person posting nigger didnt make people think you were actually someone who hated blacks etc  more people understood anonymity there was no assumption that the person posting was like x because they have a certain opinion or like a certain thing  arguing in threads didnt really happen because it was generally seen as embarrassing most people had that arguing online is like running in the special olympics mentality  most people were into anime or had some connection to it  nobody felt that they were changing the world or part of some kind of secret hacker/political club  trolling actually involved ensnaring the victim in logic or creating threads to trick the posters  you couldnt image reply in the earlyish beginning  threads were slower but there was more threadmaking than there is now on bigger boards  4chan would go down a lot or did go down a fair amount at one point 2004 or 2005 i think  less boards   text boards were relatively active but were never great  no tabbed browsing you didnt have a bunch of threads open and reload them constantly unless you wanted multiple windows open you posted in one at a time browse away and often never found it again  more people used tripcodes than i see now  maybe surprisingly people understood sage and noko less than they do now well you dont even need to use noko now
i always get accused of being a fake oldfag despite providing quite a bit of proof a few times and after seeing how the average newfag behaves i dont even feel like sharing anything with them anymore  it dont matter none of this matters
   would go down a lot or did go down a fair amount at one point 2004 or 2005 i think  i actually found this place in early 2004 because a weeb from a forum i used told me that id like it i started lurking and then the entire site was offline for ages a couple of months maybe but it was a long time anyway
  its an imageboard you dummy of course none of this matters
  accurate /a/ /b/ and /v/ used to also have much greater crossover than they do now as muh board culture really didnt exist yet
  2009fag here those were the days to be honest    /b/ was filled with operation threads where people would do stupid shit or raid online sites info dump threads on /b/ were also the shit i raff i ruse was actually funny    as someone else said there was a shit ton of spam there was no captcha back then obviously and to be honest i dont remember the post cool down being that bad if there even was one     /v/ was considered /b/ 20  now a days i dont even think newfags use /b/ they either go straight to pol or v i dont regular those boards anymore      summerfags were absolutely a thing and people would not hesistate to call someone a summerfag    when /pol/ was first made there was actual discussion the board always leaned right but never far right like today back then it was libertarian and all ron paul shit there were stormfags and anti semites but people mostly ignored those threads because they were retarded
  more tripcodes  sounds absolutely horrible
  not really
  if at all thats the main historical reason why the ban page mentions what the name you were posting under was
  testing

stop making threads
have you tried inviting an asian girl to walk with you somewhere like a restraint for lunch
  yus    1st asian girl had pizza together took picture of her tried to hold hand ghosted    2nd asian girl had chinese together she just did homework did homework together again ghosted me when realized was coming onto to her    3rd asian girl had boyfriend    4th asian girl had ramen together stayed in her apartment for a night said she had boyfriend and ghosted me    5th asian girl had boyfriend    6th asian girl studied for 10 hours together had mcdonalds together had boyfriend tried to be friends with her at first but then she just ghosted me

about /wsr/  needs new rule  theres shit load of similar repetitive threads  can you help me find this song  they could all go in a song request general thread
similar thing should be done for the most reoccurring or duplicating threads as well
just make the general yourself and force the hell out of it
  i did but albeit new it looks to me anons continue to start their own threads
  force it harder redirect people to it until it gets popular enough that people know it by name when they got there and regularly put their requests in it just make sure that people actually get their requests fulfilled in the general so they know they can go there for song requests
stop shitting up /wsr/ trying to start stupid general threads  theres no point  the board isnt running out of space it has threads in the catalog that are 24 hours since the last bump
  it makes no sense to ask for a song and have your thread archived in less than a day because 10 other people created a similar thread on a board no one goes to
you cant really force people to use generals /wsr/ is really slow forcing threads into generals will make it even slower      if you cant be bothered to bump your thread every 12 hours you deserve not to be helped
  hurdur bump  thats stupid    and yes wsr is slow but thread creation/close is rapid which leads to small thread space number even if on a slow board

ive decided    im going to make a burg spinoff for people to discuss all things burg
  you absolutely should then you could go back there
i for one would never post a burg
already exists    
wtf this board sucks
  no way    who could have thought up that brilliant idea before me
  meant to reply to    and while its amazing and all it could really be improved by a sad burg option
will there be other menu options
  im sure he could implement other options but i dont think stuff related to sushi would be a good choice itd put him in direct competition with 
  not enough burg
  did you include burg
  i could opt for grub
  fatchouli
  fuck yes

  reminds me i was watching a youtube video a couple weeks ago about cooking and scrolled down the comment section to see what people said about trying the recipe and there was just a comment that was like im really not into incest
  is this like that one board where people could embed secret text in their images and you would need a certain program to read the posts
  no youd need to upload an image yourself to do that
  its just burg plain and simple
  you could use the burgs as 1s and 0s to write a binary message
burg thread on new board
  would it be tasty that is the question
fix this or die    i have powers /x/ cant even fathom and i am getting better each day at using them     fix this or die final destination style

how does it compare to undertale
  havent played but its probably fun enough to complete
what does /v/ think of this game
  took me about 35 hours for all routes
uhh nevermind i read that post wrong
  1 the gameplay is more fun  i was going to add that the writing is better but im not actually sure
  theyre split on it /v/ doesnt play vidya anymore so it doesnt matter     the writing is a slight bit worse
from what ive seen its more black and white kind of writting in undertale no one is evil but simply trying to survive the world around them but this game seems to have typical fantasy antagonists
  useful info regardless
go to archives  see this  what in the goddamn
im feeling really tired maybe you should delete this thread and go to sleep op
  not until i figure out whether or not some arsehole in 4chan put some worm virus in 4channel effectively ruining my laptop
im not seeing anything weird  ก
  fucking shit is there a virus in my computer wtf
  i dont see anything weird what do you mean
  not likely probably just some kind of archival error what are you seeing different from the norm

  these characters come from the thai alphabet which has all different kinds of signs vowels tone markers diacritics etc that you can stack on top of the base alphabet theres rules within the thai language which of them can be combined but unicode allows you to stack as many of them as you want  for example  has 110 mai tho glyphs u0e49 usually used for falling intonation on top of both a space and a thai letter each

  oh nice ive been wondering that for a while i didnt even know where to begin to search cheers
greetings
why are we still here
  thats really interesting
  i miss inglip tbqh
  ah ive seen outbreaks of this virus before  i believe it was developed in thailand
why do i need to do captcha in 4channel threads when i do have 4chan pass hiro pls fix it
on a date with my /qa/ gf
weebspam
two girls cant date
trashspam out of the dumpster
  shut up varappi
  but she even took me to her favorite restaurant
the ultimate get what do you think the last ever post on 4chan will say
/thread
hey wait   what was the last post on the blue boards of 4chan the post made on any blue board immediately before domain switched for good
  when did the domain switch what time exactly it was last saturday right
  the world may never know
  /site
    might get you the approximate time but i have no idea how youd find the exact time
  probably something stupid
  incredibly most likely
it will probably be a mod post of some kind thanking us for all of the fun
  so long and thanks for all the fish
  that would be nice
  what was moots last post was it in the qa thread he did
  
dicks
look what you did to me
whats the leading contender for the death of 4chan nowadays too much cost
i wonder if well even find out or if it will be lost due to the site failing
gets are never worth it
  hopefully a lengthy post saying it was shut down because most of the people involved with the website acted like trailer trash
  all boards locked  all posts deleted  only post remaining is dicks
  what did they mean by this
any last words anime
based and gridpilled
dont forgot to say rabbit rabbit when the new month starts 4 days from now
schizospam
  you say it 3 times this is probably another one of your tricks

how often do you find yourself idly touching your nether regions
  my hand has been stuck in my ass for a week now
whenever i see 2d boobies like those
most every night my hand goes straight down my pants as i fall asleep
  pic related
  whenever i used the bathroom 
my hands on my dick right now
a lot
often its a problem
  it cant be helped must rape it
  literally all the time when im not in public i love my penis so much
whenever im alone and drunk
dang i was doing it while i saw this thread  its just a force of habit
flan boobie
a thread full of trash
post the christmas boobie one
  yes that is good
the porn ads are back    yeah so when will we hear from hirohito moot about his epic failure
porn ads i thought these new ones are sfw never saw them
i really liked what 4chan was like when i started coming here but it isnt like that anymore and i cant find anywhere else thats like how it was and that makes me sad
you wont the internet has changed
i remember when things were good around here
  there is a place but if i show it to you the swarms will follow my only hint is that it is perfect
it feels like the overall iq has drooped by 20 points while hostility and rudeness have doubled it has become a pain i find myself asking if people are intentionally obtuse or just not able to comprehend a written sentence while simultaneously trying to oneup each other despite being utterly stupid its horrible
  can i have another hint
  its an imageboard and the url ends with org
also its only board managed to get barely over 3000 posts in the span of five months so feel free to abstain if you dislike imageboards which achieve less than a post per hour on average
  nobody cares go back there
  it feels like the overall iq has drooped by 20 points while hostility and rudeness have doubled  this to be honest everyone seems to be extra angry nowadays
go on autistic rants all the time  no one can trace the autism back to me  cheers to 4channel and cheers to anonymity

its where bitch rule following new fags and relaxed based old fags go to post
dda weeb mafia deyre gonna git us  i dindu nuffin when da weeb mafia showed up all of a sudden  ddey started fluding up the bord mafioso style fucking anime pics all over muh bord  seriously where da fuck do dey think dey are everyone knows anime is banned on 4channel  ddanks to baste frogbros we survived de flood but you never know when da weebs will strike again  you guys dont seriously believe this do you
go back to your spinoff
there are some who believe it and one who pretends to believe it to further his narrative
  serious question here what does this even mean isnt /qa/ a spinoff of /jp/ by that logic you want me to go back to /qa/ because /qa/ is my homeboard you know
  do you seriously think people wont realize this is a falseflag    theres 50 regulars here its very easy to know whos who
  oh yeah who am i
  fuck off trevor
  heh not even close
  why should i know or care you make obvious falseflag threads all the time to keep the drama alive
  you make obvious falseflag threads all the time  ive made like 3 threads on /qa/ in its entire existence youre pretty bad at this
youre pretty pathetic for a weeb mafia don
  he fell for the weeb mafia meme  embarrassing
  but da weeb mafia spinoff schizospam
look there was a period of time before you showed up where things were different thats why people know that you showed up at a certain time and what youre doing to make things different  you can do damage control forever and maybe eventually the people that know better will give up but its all in service of a lie
  leave the bumped posts in the original order and delete the bumps  can a bot delete its own posts
  it used to be able to before mods cracked down this summer
  how
  no matter how many times they are caught red handed all they will do is deny deny deny
  there are many ways one way is to manually do it another is to incorporate it into the script to delete one minute after posting another way is to post cp or naked lolis and get the ip banned in which case mods delete all of the posts associated with the ip automatically the third option here is what has been happening since mods removed the ability for users to delete posts due to all the abuse
  another is to incorporate it into the script to delete one minute after posting  i mean is this achievable i guess if the bot can be commanded to read the post button it can be commanded to press the delete button but how does it know which post is his    the third option here is what has been happening since mods removed the ability for users to delete posts due to all the abuse  wat but i have the delete option right here
test  regtest
  well this is news
  yeah those fucking weebs amirite        1 weeb post in that image  oonly the weeb mafia could be responsible for dis xdd  schizophrenia is one heck of an impairment
  who do you think you are fooling
dumb false flagger
hi i am gj sussman founder and ceo of sicp while lamenting over the lack of forced indentation in scheme last night your mother called me and asked me if i would be so kind as to help her with a sicp exercise being the fine gentleman that i am i put on my dapper wizard hat and robe and went over to her house roguishly sneaking through the back door i knocked her out with a cudder and tore the garments off her ripe body her full breasts aroused me to the degree that my evaluator stood straight in the time it takes to do a lazy computation not being able to contain myself i shoved my righteous sussboy in the manhole of the fine lass it was obviously not designed for a man of my obscene girth and she woke up from the pain not caring about anything but my manliness i continued thrusting as she fainted again from the agonizing torture of the tripedal creature looming over her in a minute i was about to explode with the force of several angry supernovas in a sack  the flood came and like moses i cleaved her in half from the shock not stopping i shoved the hose in her eye socket and let the rest of the sauce enter her skull after that i went home and read sicp until i fell asleep i guarantee it
  hello im george zimmer founder and ceo of the mens warehouse that reminds me of a funny anecdote involving a rape  murder case in nineteen ninetyseven this fair maiden laid crying for help screaming her mother has been raped and split apart she mustnt have been past two decades of age promptly ignoring the call of the cops i used my charm and my adonic strength to grasp of this lasss attention and bosom despite this display of masculine affection her noise only intensified so i after pondering this uncanny situation concluded that she appeared to be under the effects of unchecked histrionics i surmised to cure her of this disease by act of bending her over while the raging manhood lying between my legs took hold of her insides my incounmesurable girth did shut her incoherent screaming but now it was replaced by incoherent panting a solution to which i arrived by unleashing gallons upon gallons of my seed until her insides ripped and filled her digestive track and stomach effectively closing her esophagus forever you see this method will help you silence any person of the fairer gender and make fer forever your worshiping slave i guarantee it
why are the mafiosi so mean to schizoweeb hes just a like naive child trying to help his friends in his own way and all he gets in return is being called a falseflagger people talking shit behind his back and conspiring to make him feel unwelcome and isolated    schizoweeb i hope you realize someday that your real friends were indeed here on /qa/ but it was the frogposters all along
  see 
wow
weeby uh they say theyre iffy uh  but i aint about that trap shit nuh  yuh  spam is ok when i do it  suck a dick or two  fuckos worse than a rootkit  uh no but slim why you gotta hate  sorry mom i just spammed the board and snorted crack cocaine  i get really angsty when i see the green  guys dont know the extent of a lean teen machine  yeah thats right im all about the spam  catch me in irc fangirling worse than stans  no they dont hear ya mods are dead  fuck a loli bitch or two  whats wrong  oh right they just deleted my thread  im too drunk to be alive morphine diapers pills everything deprived  no fuck you i aint about that shit  because they catch it archived  im gonna make you kneel while i spit  no slim why you gotta do this weeb mafia secret govermnent everything but you just keep on pulling it  i take it eazye frens dont catch me raging in the thread no i clown you harder than those messed up flows  oh wait you linked it in the archive  ignore it boys we gonna bury that guy alive  plugs mic off  im out
  piss off you baboon my post was directed towards the subhuman trash known as op
the frogposters did not like this thread one bit when will they learn to take it easy
  when you finally go back to your spinoff
  no
  yes
  reply hazy
/qa/ deserves spoiler tags because we need them sign this petition so the developer can put spoiler tags on /qa/ if we get enough signatures they will listen    sign it now
cringe
  sign it
  he needs to spoiler meta posts  cringe
bluepilled  cringes
  done
  are you a girl do you have cute feet
signed
you have my support
if we get enough signatures they will listen
and fuck niggers too
  lol
im in favor of spoilers on /qa/
agreed
  updated you missed a signature friend
  it doesnt count unless you sign
  signature not a seal remove the emblem or it cant be official
where is echibiki    echibiki      sign the paper
    i did my best on this 4 inch tablet
  why do you keep summoning that creature
give me dat paper  theres not enough rooooom ill just use my super long penis powers to extend it  expand dong    this isnt just about having spoiler tags this is about /qa/ being recognized as an official sfw board /qa/ will not be cut for hiromoot budget cuts ever    illlll sign it
  ugh why would you want your wife to smoke
ppoiler tags are just used on kuso boards as boring post enhancers like greentext abuse  they dont belong on /qa/ and would just be another step at /qa/ being made worse through staff interference  sjis would be nice however
  go away
  go away please
why would you reply to me twice
  i love you jevin youre so based
  uh no id only use it if i was talking about spoilers to great anime series
  spoileryou dont belong on /qa//spoiler
  we all know this is just to help hide your loli porn even more
ha ha it was a trap
  youll be hearing from my lawyer
  u aint me but its cute that u tried to find the font i used and named the file jevpng      osaka
  spoilers are great fun but nothing makes me rage harder than a spoilered youtube link when im phoneposting pic semi related
  would you stupid faggots stop posting that ugly fat dumb hick blonde kid and claim thats me
  fixed
i feel the term lesbian trapped inside a mans body describes me almost perfectly and im no sure how to feel about that
  im pretty sure thats just lust you dummy
i know just what you mean
suck my cock dude

  wish i had some
  is she ok   if we sprinkle some pepper on you would you sneeze her out or something

  i used to feel that way when i was younger but then i learned to love cocks
  you most likely have agp and should probably just kill yourself
i dont want to be trans just a cute boy
hold up wait a minute now what was your question
2 cars leave the same house at the same time one is heading east and the other west the eastbound car travels at 90 miles per hour the westbound car travels at 80 miles per hour how long will it take for the two trains to be 816 miles apart
wait where do the trains come from are we talking about train cars here
whats the shortcut to hide threads again

dumb gross frogshitter
the thread is based and op redpilled
hay /qa/ have you heard my little pony is ending next year will this be the end of /mlp/
everyone hopes so but it likely wont  also to be more precise theyre just replacing everything with the next iteration of the brand which will be the fifth generation
  hay tomoko have you head flash is being discontinued in 2020 will this be the end of /f/
    i dont have high hopes for the board viewership is dropping and the board really only serves to beat a dead horse haha at this point chances are everyones gonna bail g5 and then /mlp/ will be deleted im just concerned about gr15 being repealed and barneyfag killing himself lol      not at all likely theres a lot of preservation going on and most of 4chans old culture and history is in the form of flashes even if anyone post2012 couldnt appreciate them
  die you fucking barneyfag    spoilerlol joking if thats true then mlp had a good run not that lee gives a shit he still spergs endlessly about barney despite it being dead for about a decade mental illness man nothing short of death will make him stop/spoiler
  well thats unfortunate

  i used to think it was sirno  literally me
  if youre me then who am i
what is your question and/or meta topic
hiro make a /cel/ board for eceleb discussion  that way the shills can have an echoe chamber and we dont have 10 threads about the latest epic thing some braindeadfaggot did     it only attracts more retards
you are boring op your life is a snoozefest and youre mediocre and will leave no legacy to speak off get off your high horse
  your thread is not about vidya and will get deleted sad but true
  thread was moved to /qa/  user was banned for criticizing moderation
  im all for this those eceleb threads are not only populated exclusively by children but also by people who dont play games at all and just watch them on youtube/switch jannies used to remove these threads but now they just let them happen  this cult of personality shit isnt video games and the people there never discuss video games at all  if they cant remove them or add a board at least relegate them to a general in /vg/b so we dont have to scavenge /v/ for video game threads  and no some greasy fuck mugging at the camera isnt video game culture
  we dont need more underage shills in this place
call it /boners/
who are your favorite ecelebs /v/  mine are the best friends
  probably true but ops still correct and youre a fag for defending cancer
  they really should make a /cel/ board so in/cel/s like you can stop posting here
makes an eceleb board  every jackass with one view on youtube tries to become the next pewdiepie  they spam every board with their bullshit trying to gain fame  it would only work if assholes started paying for ads
  he shrinks the more he lies/gets game facts wrong
dsp general please
i bet you would be the first person to report avgn threads
  you think he hid in a closet and ate all that chocolate in one sitting
  a /cel/ board for eceleb discussion  eceleb and regular celebs would fix a couple of boards not just /v/
  op i have a response for you
  this but there would be an influx of retards on camera so it might be hilarious
  your youtube babysitters arent related to video games just because they play them cockface
or just make a general and move it to /vg/
  projecting
there should be an internet celebrity board /incel/ or /in/ it would cut down on shilling on many different boards
  just make a containment general in /vg/ and ban anyone who posts pedopie outside of there problem solved children gone and shitposting kept to acceptable levels  of course this would require jannies to actually supervise the fucking thing
  wouldnt work too many ecelebs would generate too many tyreads and push out actual vidya discusion
  not video games
  wow someones been watching their rick and morty
agreed
  this
  just because they show a videogame on camera doesnt meam theyre related incel
  the moment ps2 belongs to /vr/ im outta here not like there are many games since then worth talking about desune
  maldraw for his redpilled tweets and patreon rewards  elon musk for spacex  jontron for being a sad sack of shit
  i wonder when thats going to happen were already at the point where people slightly younger than the ps2 are allowed to post here
  lol mad
  based and redpilled
  maldraw  why do so much faggots here follow this guy  everytime he tweets something /v/ will always talk about it
  it is physically impossible not to enjoy avgn other than that i basically only care about yms ihe cr1tikal and fantano but none of this is video games
  who never heard of him or seen him mentioned
  not directly but everytime he tweets about vidya related stuff theres always a thread made after he posted it  hes been talking about how ps2 is best lately and ive been seeing a huge spike of faggots here that say the same
  cr1tikal  dude went downhill hard years ago
  be elder godking of /v/  influences the vidya industry as a whole  what are you complaining about faggot
  you think he still cracks me up and i want him to fuck me hard
  its another youtube drama involving other channels that i never even heard of until now episode
people here are actually defending eceleb cancer    lol  2018 /v/ is fucking disgusting you are all newfags
  when /pol/shits start bitching to the mods for deleting their pewdipie worship threads all of 4chan start going down the reddit road  be glad you lived long enough to see 4chan becoming a real shithole
  hes pretty hot tbqh
  no its logically impossible to watch his videos for more than 10 seconds unless you have crippling autism and are unequipped to assess the videos youre watching the same thing happens with the nostalgia critic and all of those autismfuel channels id call them garbage entertainment but i doubt theyre even trying to be entertaining at this point  you need to have the rational skills of a toddler to be amused by people talking to the camera and saying nothing
  based and beepilled
  i used to watch this guy but after he died to pinwheel on stream i just cant anymore
  even as recently as 2015 /v/ got mad about pewdiepie because of that funny pizza land game that /v/ wanted to keep secret    its weird how fast things have changed
  /pol/shits are all from reddit to begin with your post makes no sense bitching threads stop the moment the jannies start even looking at the board as they should
  you sound like a pseudointellectual loser avgn is fun and soulful entertainment
  4chan is complete shit and basically  since at least 2012  but the 2018 cancer is so much more annoying because the cancernewfags dont even get called out on their newfag cancer bullshit
i hate threads about ecelebs on /v/  should i just hide them and move on with my sad pathetic life  nah ill just make a meta thread on /v/ thatll fix the problem
  haha but he said shit xd poopie lmao  youre exactly the kind of human trash we need a containment board for
is this a thinly veiled eceleb thread
  should i just hide them and move on with my sad pathetic life  princess is projecting again it would help if you played videogames instead of watching people play them perhaps you would have things to talk about with the video game board
vidya ecelebs are more on topic than meta threads prove me wrong
agreed any and all eceleb faggotry is pedopie generation gamergate nu4chan tier fuck off
  okay reddit tips fedora
  patrician choice my good man
  he got too meta with his shtick went through a phase where he just said nipple a bunch and came out the other end treating it more like a job than a hobby
  eceleb threads have existed on /v/ for a while to be fair    
  make a board for ecelebs digital media producers content creators and influencers  call it /fad/
  i bet reddit has a well populated board for that piece of shit full of diagnosed asd sacks of sewage like you
wew
  pprojecting i cant actually refute that meta threads are just as cancerous  so ill just say that you should play video games instead of watching people play them  thatll show them i just hope anon doesnt say the same about playing video games instead of making meta threads  well played
  so ill just say that you should play video games instead of watching people play them  yes you should be a part of the hobby you come here to discuss also you didnt refute a point i didnt make and two wrongs make one right is never an argument on any subject
  no
  youre the one who is giving meta threads a free pass while being against eceleb threads im against both so i dont get why youre framing my posts as me being okay with watching games over playing them
  make a /cel/ board for eceleb discussion  you know damn well those retards wouldnt use it just like how they post that shit on /v/ instead of whatever messageboard/forums they come from  /v/ just needs more proactive moderation and banning this shit on sight
  shut up and kill youself redditor
  cr1tikal  his fucking name is penguinz0
  thats alot of buzzwords my man
  a better solution would be an alternative broadcasting board kind of like alternative sports call it /atv/ it will encompass everything from youtube to podcasting to radio and encourage baby broadcasters to get started    of course this wont help /tv/ with their celebrity problem but neither should it making waifu threads about how you want to smell suchandsuchs feet is low quality /b/ garbage take that kind of thing to /b/ or /trash/ thats what those boards are for    but an alternative broadcast board will help get rid of youtuber threads and the like
  to add if 4chan implemented an alternative broadcast board like i suggested years ago then the site would have a community of personalities video editors and producers willing to assist with hiros virtual youtuber project but because this website doesnt cultivate any of the skills required to create a virtual youtuber the project will go nowhere
reminder that nobody reads suggestions on /qa/ you just got trashed
  it only attracts more retards  then why make them feel more welcome with a board
  the eternal paradox
  forget that make it /web/ or /www/ for all internet content     then it will drown out some of them
  why have /pol/ if it only attracts people who say things unironically
jontron is a fat greaser
  akshually yong yah is a contunt chreytur
move ecelebs to /trash/
  spoony was legit before the crazy got the better of him rip spoony
  if i could filter them it would be fine but they use no common keywords and come in 10s and 20s like ad spam
  what are kids suddenly calling greaser
/cel/  celebrities  gossip    there are like 6 or 7 boards that would instantly be freed of their cancer if this board existed real life celebrities ecelebrities pop idol worship and tiktok shit would all go in this containment board
in/cel/s
please
  boobs too big
fund it
  board requests go to    this one is not new so dont expect anything  begging your ass off wont change anything or the redditors would have gotten /pol/ deleted already
containment boards only work if mods consistently enforce the containment rules by banning people for making posts outside of them  but banning people for making those posts works just as well without a containment board
  no dramalert for over 24 hours    i need something to feed off
  shut the fuck up
  board requests to to the page that hasnt received an update in 3 years
  real life celebrities ecelebrities pop idols  i cant fathom how anyone could care about that stupid shit  you have my vote op
  just bring all the threads here     its not like they can make /qa/ any worse and the mods dont seem to care
  the feedback page is for contacting the staff the posts on there are really a secondary faq not all instances of feedback theyve acknowledged
  i really really like this
this would kill shills
  its what 4chan needs
  we need a /mom/  mommies  good boys board
  im all for it if it gets clairoposting and snailmailposting off of /mu/ thank god grimesposting seems to be dying out
celebrities  drama  would be great
  im personally in favor of keeping celebrities on the boards they are related to such as /tv/ and /co/ while making a /www/ board for internet content and ecelebs since they are two different types of cancer
  in favor of keeping celebrities on the boards they are related  no fuck that i want kpop off the fuck off /mu/
  /ten/dies
  make me you fucking faggot
  kpop  how bad is it  do they at least stick to one thread
  they stick to one thread but they immediately abandon every thread as soon as it hits the bump limit and theyre extremely fast compared to /mu/ so there are always like 45 threads in the catalog at a time
  sounds like its a problem that could be fixed with a more active janitor making a whole board seem like overkill
  well its not solely for kpop it would also clean up spam on /tv/ /gif/ /wsg/ /v/ /r9k/ and many other boards
  /tv/  lost cause  /gif/ /wsg/ /v/ /r9k/  what normal celebrities are there i can see ecelebs being a problem for /v/ but not normal ones
  a bold idea
  can you elaborate
  youtube videos will now end with come and meme in my thread over at 4channel/celeb/ bois
  there are some videos with comments like that right now
  implying any youtuber would ever tell people to come here    even people who read green text stories dont do that
  most seem to tell people to stay away
  boobs too small
    one guy ssethtzeentach directed people towards the elona /jp/ general when he reviewed the game and did the same with honey select and /h/  its by no means common but it has happened
  that was the site was called 4chan now its 4channel is completely different
why are you trying to fix 4chan 4chan was never good people always had problems and the site still survives and gets bigger oldfag culture is a terrible idea because their memes and behaviors were just as bad as the /pol/yps and wojak edits we have today if youre looking at this site as a home or something with a discernible culture youre doing it wrong    t been here since 2005
lole trying to be like oldfigs is bad but lemme cash in on that oldfag cred
my name is doug and i have mesothelioma   
on the contrary 4chan was always good and thats why im still here after twelve years
/qa/
  so they are smelling each others farts right
watch at your own risk
  no
  when do they fart then bath or shower is like the best time to let it all out
the fucking norms ああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああ
ew its a man kill it
what is this dumb normie shit
i want to cum inside an anon who has never been loved
  cant relate  im not 20 yet
  what the fuck is this shit
  post steam
having a good time hanging out with the /qa/ frog
schizospam
i did something very peculiar lets see if it works out
this has absolutely 100 completely nothing at all to do with /qa/
  based  redpilled
  the frogman is /qa/ culture
  wrong the frog is a 4chan meme and this is the 4chan meta board
  redditfrog
  cant imagine reddit squatting in my mind 24/7
hello
i dont know what stinks more your body odour or your bullshit in either case id like to take this opportunity to implore you to return to the bottomless abyss from whence you came
i love you so much please never stop posting
schizospam
this has everything to do with /qa/
sunbro dealing it out true and harsh once again
you have been visited by the sunposter   weebspam resistance increased 40 for the next 6 hours
its an unspoken secret that /qa/ /s4s/ and /bant/ are essentially the same incestuous community
sounds hot
  you wish this was true but in reality this is the only board where crossboarders come to complain
  /bant/ is full of 3rd worlders though
maybe /bant/ but esfores is different peoples
  /bant/ s4s /qa/ and nu/jp/ are exactly the same in their inane shitposting except with the occasional political flavour for /bant/ and the lolsorandum imaekmeem nature of s4s
  you would have to be a giant shitposter yourself to think that they are nothing alike
  2d/random board combination when
    yup
i only post on /qa/ i like neither /bant/ nor esfores
so what does one do when they lose a lawsuit and are indebted a sum which they have no way of paying    lets assume the following you have a job that pays belowaverage salary but you dont nearly have enough assets to sell to pay for the debt while im guessing its possible to plead to the judge to reduce the debt to a number possible to pay let us assume thats not the case this time    so with a debt on your shoulders you could only pay off by winning the lottery or having a strike of luck would a person be stuck forever paying off a debt that would garner more interest than you can pay    i know a relative who was in this kind of situation before but somehow got out of it not by any monetary means of course  thats why i was wondering what wouldve happened if that were not the case  most of you are probably from the west so us jurisdiction will do as reference just fine
they will come after all of your assets be it a car or a home or a bank account until you have paid off the balance of the debt they will garnish your future wages to make up the rest if you dont have enough assets
what program/notepad thing do you guys use to store passwords
notepad with a password on the file
  that doesnt seem that secure
  dont get h4ck3d ez
keepass like a decent human bean
keepassx here
a sheet of paper in my desk and my head
keepassxc
my brain
  this
master key is stored in my brain   feed it and website name into a password generator program written by me to generate password
i do the same as the strike witch but absolutely without a doubt had the idea before them
  nice try nsa
  my browsers default password storage for websites and a piece of paper in my wallet
  i whisper all my passwords to my cat whenever i forget my passwords i ask my cat and he meows them back to me
  the purrfect system
  a sheet of paper  okay  in my desk  sounds hard to grab  and my head  sounds very painful
  blast from the past
  ill make mine into a tripcode
keepass2 works decently well on windows and linux with mono and random scrap files ive encrypted with gnupg
  interesting concept
  only posted to share  its not much better than writing the password down directly
  its not much better than writing the password down directly  thats what i do  i wonder if they read  
  simple  less things to go wrong  more secure
  what id do if i had to write down my passwords is disguise xkcdstyle passwords as a sat/gre vocab learning list    wave measure try until  my wave to my friends was laconic they were planning on ditching me from the start  an iconoclast should be measured by the strength of his own beliefs instead of the institutions he attacks  this prosaic game is not worth trying if its not interesting why play it  i hate how scrupulous his room is  its not worth wading through all that trash to find what im looking for  i wont talk to you until you tone down your capricious nature
  keepassxc because im linux master race
  ha mom wont be reading my diary anymore   thanks dude
  it needs a strong password on the file though or its not very secure at all
  what are its features
  i remember my passwords with my brain
  what do got you need to hide so badly     yer loli porn folder
  keepass anything else is nonfoss botnet
  stupid and inefficient
  compared to the previous keepassx it can directly operate on both keepass and keepass2 databases its written in qt it doesnt need mono to run
bitwarden  its open source dont use lastpass
  i have my email and password tattood on my ass in case i die that people can explore my legacy
  my crypto exchange passes and wallet codes
  so the opposite of the please destroy my hard drives approach
  in case i die  or get too drunk
  you could have both the privacy of your body and data invaded
  an actual notepad
  whats the best f/oss botnet
  keepass is really the best crossplatform solution there is but there are other solutions as well  for example pass the standard unix password manager its not really a standard it is straightforward in a sense that every password it stores is merely a gpgencrypted file in a directory which can be optionally versioncontrolled with git the downside is that everyone can immediately tell how many passwords you have stored and for which websites/services depending on how descriptive you get with entry names  
when im in the process of learning a password i just write it down on physical paper and put it in a drawer its annoying to get to the drawer so the incentive is there to memorize it
are you fucking kidding me you retarded jannies
why isnt ban evasion a report option
  you deserved it     eat shit
  haha you post on /tv/  mods  mods  weve got a ban evader here
that filename is lacking an s  do it again and get it right
  i cant retarded jannies banned me for racism apparently wanting to fuck someone makes you racist towards them god i hate jannies
  i said do it again  go
  they banned me
  good
does /qa/ watch any type of pornography why or why not
nothing out of real porn anymore except that one couple that had a few decent homemade videos
yes a lot i dont know why it just happens
i find myself downloading lewd gravure videos sometimes regular porn is just too boring
no its degenerate and unhealthy
i only ask because ive really cut down on the amount of porn i look at ant the amount of time i spend masturbating ive realized that 99 of the time i even look at porn or jack off is because im bored sometimes i dont even want to jerk it but do anyways because i have nothing else to do dont really care for porn anymore and 3d porn is pretty disgusting now
  i jack it to all sorts of porn depends on my mood sometimes i want to see anime tiddie sometimes i want to see 3d tiddie sometimes i want to see furry tiddie sometimes i want to see a furry anime get raped by a centipede theres no rhyme or reason to it
i prefer ecchi to out and out porn since it leaves more to the imagination
  either occasionally or often what counts as porn      same
watching porn is one of the worst things you could do to your mind you may not notice it soon you may actually never notice it but your life will take certain tragic turns and the results of these turns will sprout a bitter and foul fruit be aware
  i usually include ecchi in my definition of pornographic also pictures and doujins      you may not notice it soon you may actually never notice it but your life will take certain tragic turns and the results of these turns will sprout a bitter and foul fruit be aware  yes that is true but it would be true regardless of whether or not we were talking about porn i dont et what youre trying to say
yes more than i should partly because the kids on this website wont stop posting all sorts of porn everywhere and moderation is bad at removing it  because masturbation feels good and visual stimulation enhances the feeling
yeah i just did
i have a list of girls i met in my life i was attracted to then i have a list of pornstars that look like said girls whenever i meet someone irl that looks like a girl i know its a few clicks away to pretend sex with her then i pretend like i never saw her face ever its what i have to do
  you could just use your imagination
  post list and how often do you do this
  imagination carries risk  what if i think about my grandma then i cant will myself not to think about her and my fap is ruined      as rarely as possible although considering how often i dream and how often i go outside not rare enough
  what if i think about my grandma then i cant will myself not to think about her and my fap is ruined  you either need to learn more self control or accept that you have a granny fetish
  why the fuck would you even think about your grandma while masturbating in the first place
nah not really  maybe like five minutes every two or three days to fap and get rid of any lust i may have and i use the same material most of the time
    maybe i saw a grandma on the streets the other day next to the smoking hot chick that got me bothered maybe travelling back in my memories the girl i had a crush on was grinding next to this fugly ass dude maybe i dip a bit into what a pathetic failure my life is and how disappointed my parents  now im thinking about my parents so fucking annoying id rather just keep a porn catalog and be done with it
  ok you need to learn some self control then
yesi masturbate 12 times a week to incest doujins on sadpanda   if you want qualityput this in english translated inseki lolicon shotacon group cousin  also put 4 stars on minimum rating aswell uncheck every option in the top exept for manga and doujinshi you should have about 1800 quality incest fap material im on page 22 so far
  a small correction on what to input in the search bar incest english translated inseki lolicon shotacon group cousin    i forgot to input incest in my last post
fapped to tonyface today
  loli once or twice a day mostly on gelbooru and nhentai i used to go on sadpanda but my plugin stopped working
   my plugin stopped working  edit your cookies baka
  aint doing it and nhentai and the cafe already have all the doujins i need
just some hentai for the plot it was something like 200 pages
  i read doujins and watch hentai  i dropped 3d porn because my sister guilt tripped me into it she said that women get exploited in porn and that i was perpetuating a harmful industry
  nowadays with independent camgirls theyre exploiting their fans instead
  i never got into camgirls to be honest feels kinda akward
  me neither but i saw some video where some naked girl was clapping and bouncing up and down whenever somebody donated and it made me feel like i was watching some dystopian movie where all interactions are faked and nobody is genuine anymore but it wasnt a movie its just modern society
  they choose to do that shit
i dont watch porn with actual sex but i like gravure idols and those videos where girls pretend to jerk you off while showing off their boobs
  porn almost always ruins something really think about it
  for you or for the pornstar
  for anyone or anything involved id say the least destructive pornography is drawn and only has completely original characters and is only solo softcore
  thinks about it  sorry nothings coming to mind
  it sounds like you are speculating and paranoid your sister really did a number on your head
  completely original characters  thats literally my fetish i just cant fap to characters from anime and video games for some reason
  what would happen if you really liked a doujinshi like top 5 of all time and then later you discovered it had a character from some franchise
  ask your sister to make porn for you
  if anything porn like all sex trade gives women too much power  i hate women and have limited my porn consumption because i want to live a life free of female influence
i seek enjoyment through the most purest form of just existing i have given up on pornography
delete /pol/
dont
  deleting a containment board what can go wrong
  what is /pol/  the only boards i see are  a / c / g / k / m / o / p / v / vg / vr / w vip / qa cm / lgbt 3 / adv / an / asp / biz / cgl / ck / co / diy / fa / fit / gd / his / int / jp / lit / mlp / mu / n / news / out / po / qst / sci / sp / tg / toy / trv / tv / vp / wsg / wsr / x     there dosnt seem to be a /pol/
  containment  yeah thats why youre here
delete yurus
subsidize /sci/
  hanako prpr
third season was really disappointing they shouldnt have switched studios
  pre /pol/  no containment required  create a containment board to contain a non existent problem  problem comes into existence  but we gotta have a containment board or the problem will be everywhere
  but we gotta have a containment board or the problem will be everywhere  literally yes /pol/ is the fastest board on the site theyre not all gonna leave if its gone
  delete /tv/  
what if they made a separate website just for /pol/ and they stayed there  like not just 4chan/nel like something totally separate
  delete op
  bad taste tyo did a good job on the ovas and s3
  surely youre not too dumb to understand that when thousands of exiled rightwing redditors flock to a site because it has le ebic free speech happening board and make it the biggest board on the site in the process those newfags are not magically going to disappear once you remove the board right
is it weird that im a left wing 2016 election newfag
  get the bd rip you slow motherfucker did you just download it from bakabt without paying attention
  the long ova was the worst episoide no sense of humor and the fake ass heartfelt moments made me want to die season 3 was ok but it still had that same slow chinese plastic kind of forced comfy to it that made it much worse
  wow  such terrible taste  wow
  i like fun anime not some sentimental bullshit thats trying to convince you not to end your life by trying to force down your throat that life is beautiful without proving it to you
  imagine being so retarded to miss the point of yryr episodes lmao
  left wing  just say bbc loving tranny
  its for japs whove been crushed by life and need to imagine having friends with some infantilizing show where nobody gets mad at each other because thats scary personality is scary too how about we tone everyone down a ton so theyre just husks of human beings see now its comfy now whats wrong with you dont you like comfy
  none of the episodes even opened with akarin absolute trash
  literally what are you rambling on about      fair enough i missed that along with the old transitions between parts a and b
  yes delete /pol/ once that board is gone so are the people there is no way in hell they will migrate to other boards because they are delete
  delete all those who insult pol
  /pol/ doesnt even exist on this domain faggot
  what in the literal fuck are you trying to say is there a point somewhere in all that hyperbolic word salad
on ssris   takes me 23 hours sometimes to have an orgasm  tthanks
you deserve it headcase
sad
thats what you get for letting jews play around your brain chemistry
i always knew grimes was a tranny she has a tranny face some may even call her a troon    we dont talk to those people
doctors are primarily medication salesmen you got sold medicine you dont need it and its only going to hurt you youre supposed to feel pain when youre fucking up its your body telling you to confront your shit masking it with drugs prolongs the issue confront your problems wuss
well /qa/
back to your spinoff
awful spam thread
i didnt like the ending to this arc
forget you for ever once winter starts
if i was goblin slayer i would have sex with her
pic related
gobbed goods
  its just been 9 episodes
  i would wife her
  what a slut
  marry her and never do anything beyond kissing
  but then how is she supposed to bear your offspring
    foot stuff
  he probably imagined her gobbed up disfigured cunt and shuddered
/qa/
i was sticking to my 30 day ban in fact i was happy to have a break from the site for once i wasnt going to ban evade yet somehow im able to post what the fuck i didnt delete cookies or anything why is this allowed
mods might have removed your ban maybe you are just having a lucky day
dynamic ip
  i thought thats what cookies are for yes my isp changes my ip once about 4 hours however the ban always sticks if i dont touch my cookies its odd that the ban stuck for i dont know about 15 days or so and then suddenly no more ban
  did you restart your browser also you might still have cookies that ban you on 4chanorg but not on 4channelorg
it was lupus
no it was ligma
  its never lupus
very important question i dont want to watch it by myself
you mean the actual toradora stream maybe if other /qa/eers are watching it too
i think itd be cool to watch one or two episodes a day and then talk about it that way you dont need to catch a stream and also you wont run the risk of getting the thread deld and banned for advertising a stream
  i think hes talking about the annual /a/ christmas stream of toradora
  /a/  streaming
  ano  
  it was a joke dummy
  im too tired for jokes  guess i ought to sleep
  me too fellow north/south american    or person from somewhere else with a unnatural sleep schedule
  depends if i have time then ill probably be busy with family and stuff
  no stop asking
  so how old is this tradition
i suppose its not bad but its more of a nostalgia flick
ill watch ive never seen it
i would but the /a/ stream is always when im sleeping
cute tiger
i dont care about /a/ but i guess ill watchwith them if there no /qa/ tigertrain
  well you werent at all clear about what stream you meant
yes
whats this
a dying person
the weeb mafia
6/151
schrizophrenia
  i dont think schizophrenia entails trying to communicate with another person
next one should be a public ban with a sticky
what the fuck is going on
  
owo  
  uh oh we made a mistake messing with him
  is there a new mod that doesnt know how to delete or something
  its always gonna be a mystery to us little guys
you faggots piss me off so much    i would be glad if one morning i were to wake up and find this board deleted and everyone whos ever posted here banned    your pathetic spam the long dead avatars your taking it easy your cutesy acting your repulsive frogs the fake drama and your absolutely abominable randomness  cant stand it    enjoy your weekend wagecuck  youll die of cancer
i once had a stake in this but then the steamteens assembled
have to agree never saw such concentration of fake and rotten people on any board
rent free
  not really pretty much everything mentioned in there is real and just as bad as described
whats not to like
  everything
appeal a 30day ban evasion ban  provide proof that there was no ban evasion  mod admits there was no ban evading changes the ban reason but keeps the 30day ban in place    i dont care about the ban itself since i mostly post at work im just amazed at the level of incompetence on display here how is it possible they can give out false bans like this i can only see two options the moderator just wanted to ban me and made this infraction up because its penalty length is the longest or they initially thought i was actually ban evading and were simply wrong either doesnt exactly speak highly of them
show us the post
so the news says theres now a setting option under navigation to display the full list of boards on 4channelorg but i cant find this navigation setting anywhere     i know im retarded but can someone point out to me where i have to go to fix this i just wanna be able to navigate to the 4chan nsfw boards from 4channel sfw ones again
i didnt know where it was either and i found it in fifteen seconds its pretty intuitive you can figure it out
  yeah i just found it for anyone else having the same problem  yes it is in the obvious place  the settings button at the top and bottom of the page  but itll only show the right setting list if youre in a thread if youre in the catalog itll only show catalogrelated settings thats what was tripping me up i checked it in the catalog didnt see the right settings and assumed that must not be the right place    i
baasedoung  can you drop the god damn word filter already
dubs and i wake up with yves sitting on my facepurely
are we here orbits
almost 6 hours and this shit is barely at page 5  what a dead board
if i tell only half of my story i end up looking worse than before    and no one will hear my full story if they ever do it becomes half again as they weigh the narrative of my nemesis
 you  bumping a serious and profound thread
is chad warden question and answer culture
  i dont know but he is vip quality
ahem
fuck sony
  who is this guy anyway
  he made the most commented youtube video until google bought the site and deleted it
  spoonfeeding newbabbies    next youre gonna explain those last two syllables to him
also im pretty sure he shut it down himself
what do you think your average 4channler looks like
like a cute anime girl
  4channler
is this nsfw
  youve got a problem with seeing man boobs
  if girl boobs are banned then why should man boobs be allowed how are they different
  because manboobs arent sexy and dont ruin everyones nofap think before you post ok
  manboobs arent sexy  prove it
  well i guess they can be sexy if youre into that kinda thing
  id suckle moobies in a no gay homosexual way of erotic homolust and faggotry
  4channler  gas the mods board war now
  there she is its /qa/chan
is the singlemetathread per board redacted
  no but the mods say they are so they are
    this is retarded
  doesnt matter mods  gods
  singlethread meta per board was never a rule it was an experiment that wasnt meant to last more than 1 day how did you miss the announcement in pic related being up for months
  thats not what gookmoot said thats just what the mods decided when they got tired of seeing people bitch and whine
  wrong hiro tried answering questions on /v/ when he said declared it a failure and then said to use /qa/ for meta
  modsfags     ban logs prove it
  a buildingyou clod lol i know r/woooosh but get it its a meme e
yep thats me youre probably wondering how i got into this situation
it all started in the summer of 86
i really dont care at all
why is sorting threads by last reply an option it literally lists threads by the last reply ignoring sage and completely defeating its purpose
  i bump threads that people sage out of spite because people use sage as a downvote    last reply is useful for this
ignoring sage and completely defeating its purpose  yeah thats why i use it  also you seem to have sage confused with some sort of downvote feature
  kill yourself redditor sage is not a downvote
  meme quotes  kys my man
i just saw my nephew driving this in forza horizon should i be worried /qa/
  i know this is nu4chan but at what point did anons forget they were the original weebs
  april of 2006
i approve
  you should be worried since he already has better taste than you apparently
what are your thoughts on 4chans and other sites ban philosophy and what do you feel would be the best way of going about moderation on imageboards from my perspective 4chans way of handing out and dealing with bans is too ineffective alongside the way it seems to treat its posters maybe its just the size of the userbase and the moderation being tired of moderating but i cant say for sure i feel as though the way bans are given out for periods of a day or longer for nearly all offenses only fosters hatred and anger towards the staff and encourage people to evade their bans rather than actually wait them out my idea of a perfect system would be if janitors were to handle minor offenses and be able to maybe hand out bans that last an hour or two at max leaving the more serious offenses to mods the point of using short bans being that people may feel more inclined to wait them out and maybe even avoid posting rule breaking posts in the future as it would just incur a minor annoyance they have to deal with if that were to be the norm then maybe people would feel less inclined to evade so much
  first off people really just need to stop being special snowflakes and think that they never did anything wrong when they get banned instead of really asking themselves what got them banned and not assuming its for some bullshit irrelevant reason like the mods are sjws or something its really not even hard to not get banned people just need to stop being retards the only thing i would do is make 1 day bans appealable and have janitors give out warnings hour long bans are pointless and might as well be warnings second everything would improve if the mods would communicate more this leads to less assumptions and ire from the userbase and more understanding but this also raises the issue that mods kill/derail every thread they speak in by virtue of being mods a real metaboard where mods were always present would be ideal but they obviously dont care that much or its too much effort unfortunately a problem that will never be fixed is the mods being biased it could be ameliorated if we got new mods that more or less perfectly represented the communitys opinions as a whole but thats not happening
an imageboard is fundamentally about being able to talk without having to worry about identity of a speaker but the quality of the dialogue unfortunately people tend to forget the quality part and simply use anonymity as a reason to shitpost because they can get away with it
  people really just need to stop being special snowflakes and think that they never did anything wrong when they get banned  im in complete agreeance with this and mostly think the same way although the mod bias sometimes makes it a bit difficult to accept certain bans over others  hour long bans are pointless and might as well be warnings  thats actually what i was going for with that point and why i suggested janitors should be able to use them itd be more like a kick from 4chan since it wouldnt affect them all that long but would be an annoyance to people that dont learn from their mistakes since theyd accumulate hours spent banned compared to being able to post maybe its foolish on my part but id assume that people would eventually start to dislike being banned and try to better their behavior so that theyd be able to post more also maybe a way to address if you dont trust any run of the mill janitor enough with bans would be to have the more senior ones in charge of them  also while a /q/ styled meta board would be nice in theory in practice thered just be too many people complaining for the mods to deal with while also managing everything else they do it may even take away time from other boards and possibly distort the mods views on said boards for that reason i think if they were just more open about their views and what they do on at the very least irc thatd be a lot better for everyone nobody likes a shadow group deciding what they can and cannot say especially when theres real concerns over this group being completely disconnected from the sites userbase
0 monderation and no bans  all mods aare uncessary and gay  posters should be rersponcible for maintaing post quality not mod
  while i agree that there should be as little moderation and bans as possible theyre a bit necessary for banning stuff such as cp spam and people that cannot do anything but make things worse for everyone else
ip bans are a joke sure they can help to ban spammers if thats what it takes to get them to stop or slow down and to ban proxies to keep them from being used for spam but when you have an elaborate system where ip bans are thought of as punishments and you expect people to wait them out youre just going to make yourself angry when nobody complies with your expectations besides on an anonymous imageboard moderation should be focused on content not identities on 4chan the reverse is the case the mods of 4chan prioritize finding ban evaders over improving the boards its a sick system
  cp definitely  spam everyone agrees on except the /intl/ crowd they always ended up with unusable imageboards and actual discussion on discord but it would be nice if they could find a mechanism to make it work i stop by from time to time to see if its gotten any better
using 4chan as a basis for how other imageboards should be is pretty stupid  rather than trying to define acceptable moderation one should consider what is unacceptable mods exist for the benefit of the community they should be invested in what theyre moderating and moderate to the satisfaction of said community within reason
the ban system is flawed in an interesting way it cant deal with spammers but it also takes away power from powertripping mods ive gotten banned for ableism calling someone an idiot and for liking something a mod disliked that doesnt have any impact here it also combines with anonymity makes it so you dont have to worry about losing the identity youve built  to me the main problems of moderation aside from being human is that theres normally too small of a team and with disproportionate power what could be done is somehow make the mod team liable through the possibility of kicking them out and maybe holding a kind of democratic process to determine new mods and in this way prevent a stagnant clique from forming as well as force them to communicate but this all depends entirely on the community being responsible has anything like that been tried i only know of /z/ and a dead 8gag board  a measure ive thought of which may be turbocancer is to require an account to post but also make all accounts have to wait a certain time before theyre enabled though i think a spammer would simply make a ton of accounts and only the normal users would suffer maybe temporarily block accounts that havent logged in after x time  i also dont think short bans would make people less inclined to evade switching ips will always take less than two hours but its worth trying out
  2 hours  youre awfully generous bang 10 seconds  new ip didnt even have spoof no mac
  thats my point
  a measure ive thought of which may be turbocancer is to require an account to post but also make all accounts have to wait a certain time before theyre enabled  i think ylilauta does or did that at some point if so maybe a finn could comment on why it was done and how well it worked
  yeah the system is absolutely corrupt and seems to go about all forms of moderating in the wrong way except when it comes to keeping people out since thats the only things mods seem to care about if its at all related to making the place more enjoyable or less hellish for people other than themselves they couldnt give a rats ass about the issue only when they themselves are annoyed do they feel like stepping down from their throne to actually take action never for the benefit of others but solely for themselves
i feel banning should be more a last resort rather than the conventional way of dealing with a problem but with how 4chan is set up and operates im not sure how it could be any other way
  nothing should be bannable with the exception of things that break american law overtly
  what about things that make the board unusable for everyone like nonstop spam
  spam is cool
  part of its allure
mods should ban whoever they feel like for any reason posters are trash and should be treated as such
  spam is subjective and obnoxious people can be ignored illegal content is the only things that should be deleted and even then thats out of necessity minimal to no moderation is best  imean look at whats plaguing /q/a
  what do you do when people stop actually using the site because of the spam and instead use a heavily moderated associated discord channel
  its not subjective to have a cooldown and ban proxies and vpns
  wage war on their discord
  that seems a tad counterproductive towards keeping a community together though
  id say  hit the nail right on the head its pointless to ban users because even the most braindead anons are capable of evading bans through phoneposting rather than trying to play whackamole with persistant shitposters ban whatever theyre doing thats breaking the rules if theyre spamming blacklist whatever phrases theyre spamming posting something offtopic make sure that topic cant be made by them in the future posting porn on a blue board ban that md5 it not only gets rid of individual trouble makers but also any wouldbe copycats
my ban position is that i like chocolate milk
  makes sense
  more sense than most ban philosophies  i mean it tastes good
ought to be fixed
in order to make threads post images and make posts with less than 75 maybe more characters you should have to make an account    it would work well assuming the janitors and mods have a decent sense of morals and quality
  i disagree  oregano oregano oregano oregano oregano oregano oregano oregano
if there was a benefit to sticking with the same ip for a long period of time would that discourage ban evasion
  not unless the benefits were huge like what i posted here     the problem with that is that some ip addresses may change for legitimate reasons like resetting a home network and another thing is how long an ip would need to be logged here before it can have those permissions
what do you think of automatic no registration accounts like on the late at and its illegal clones
they should think about it more
how do we fix the country
  pay a team of experts to fix it if they fail they get blamed
  which one

what kind of crops do you like to grow /qa/    i like to growlucky item tomatos
hot peppers
i was trying to grow some tomacco this year but i think my soil ph was too high
  how large of a crop are we talking here anon    ive only grown red peppers tell us more please
ive never grown anything myself but i used to help family grew corn tomatoes strawberries and peppers tomatoes and peppers are really really easy to grow
what are some things that are easy to grow and tasty
i have a tomato plant and chives by my window
i killed my pea plants in high school biology class and let a tulip wilt even though it was an unbox and water kit my only hope is to use ollas
  ollas    because water seeps through the walls of an unglazed olla these vessels can be used to irrigate plants the olla is buried in the ground next to the roots of the plant to be irrigated with the neck of the olla extending above the soil the olla is filled with water which gradually seeps into the soil to water the roots of the plant it is an efficient method since little water is lost to evaporation or runoff        cool didnt know about this
cactuses are pretty low maintenance im growing peyotl
never did a lot of gardening

/qa/ is the customer support and complaint board
indeed sadly the outside of meta this board has no specific theme and you are free to be yourself somehow got traslated to animu/touhoufags you can be as gay and lame as you can and erp all you want flooding the board completely as if they didnt have their own lame boards
  lol shut the fuck up tripfag
  yes unfortunately this board features many offsite autists who would be lost in their zeal for shitposting without this daily reminder the real truth is this reminder thread appears on /qa/ any time they bully crossboarders like   which is often
it is now /qa/ policy that you say hello to peter
  hello peter
  hello peter you look cute today
  goodbye peter
kill me pete
hello peter are you aware peter is a she 
  hello there/qa/ cat
  hello peter
end my life peter
hey peter
  hello peter oh dearest king of /qa/
sup man
let me get that for you jacko
    hey peter this is mercedes
hello peter
  hello peter
hi peter     t manul
holy shit    
lmao
when the tproject came to my high school to talk about its shit it didnt sound as faggy as the video shows it to be makes me think less of what they are doing and not to mention all the stereotypical fags that are shown working there give off a more faggy vibe all in all makes me think the whole lgbt123 thing is about mentally ill people forming a dysfunctional society hopefully they can defagify the whole thing in the future

i am eatingi am eatingcurry om nom nom fresh straight from the cook its piping hot and the steam from it burns my eyes a little the smell is strong and the flavor intense oh ciel please give me some more im still hungry i dont think ive ever come across curry as rich as this before the flavor takes over all my senses i cant take it anymore i want more of this spicy deliciousness i find the place its coming from its a hole and i notice ciel is looking the other way the hole isnt big enough for me to use the spoon but around it is soft tissue i pull it open and decide to just use my tongue to scoop out the curry i notice another area near the curry hole dripping with something so i taste it the flavor is that of salty milk and coins i quickly return to the curry to remove the taste while eating the curry i hear a gurgling noisesuddenly a hot gust of air billows out of the hole and the curry begins flowing at an amazing pace the smell the taste the heat it all comes pouring out of the hole with such forcesoon its all over my face and the floor im slathered in it enjoying it loving it i begin lapping it off the floor my hands are covered in it i begin rubbing it into myself the heat is so intense that it begins to make my erectas the curry pours out i get closer and closer to  in the background i can hear ciel moaning in discomfort    making curry must be hard work
is there an addon to bring back legacy captcha
google got rid of legacy ages ago your best bet is using noscript captcha on 4chanx
  i cant beleive im gonna have to get an addon just for 4chan but disappearing captchas are just torture i dont know how shitposters can stand to post so much
  shitposters have super autism thats how

at 25 days of anime seen i feel like ive watched nearly all series worth watching theres some movies left but thats it i havent been hooked on to a series for at least one year
get a blog faggot
  im at 72 days and have a few dozen series im eager to watch you probably arent looking very hard
  but this is my blog rude
25d  72d  this has to be a bait
  t2043d
i dont watch anime at all anymore but when i did have a mal i had watched 4 months worth of anime    and thats not including all the manga ive read
  they mean total like if you watched all the anime at once it would take 25 full 24 hour periods to complete
  how many series is that altogether i have a text file that existed long before mal and i dont feel like spending days registering everything in there im over 1500 series but i have no idea what that translates to as days especially if its not including rewatches     i feel like ive seen pretty much everything i want to see especially as most new seasonal anime doesnt grab me
sorry but you need at least 100 days of anime watched to post about it on /qa/
i have two friends who have seen even more than me theyre both pretty normal guys and did it all while always working or going to uni   i wish i was kidding
  how are you nerds keeping track of how long youve watched  i just use a spreadsheet
  wow sugoi varappi has such a high power level
i have almost 200 days
  i had a below average power level at most in september 2013  never considered myself high at all    im honestly shocked not everyone on here has seen a year or two worth of anime since im a casual
  spreadsheet is too much work  why actually write down everything youre watching when you can just press a few buttons and have software track your shows for you  
btw    keeping track of just the name of the anime you watched is retarded    the best thing you can do the very best thing is to write a small 20 word review of every episode you watched and then a 100 word review of the series    trust me  i dont think im the only one that has completely forgotten the anime hes watched over 5 years ago  youre going to love yourself in the future if you actually bother to write down your thoughts on every episode  all those series you watched and kept on a spread sheet theyre just names now    like i watched azumanga daioh  but if someone were to ask me  what did you think of the 15 minute mark of azumanga daioh episode 7  ill have no idea  all i can guess is i think thats when they were studying for the first exams
  i cannot remember the books ive read any more than the meals i have eaten even so they have made me
no idea how the heck im 60 days
93 days and i dont watch anime with action in it
thats not even that much   i mean a series might average 12 hours   so youve only watched 50 series theres a lot more than 50 series
  these days a series averages something more like six hours
  series average around 5 hours about for your 1213 episode shows and 9 hours for 2426 episode shows
  who are you quoting serious   dont tell me to google it
i did like 50 days in 1 year  logh and aikatsu being the only 100 episode shows
  literally just google it you mong
  
  i dont think im the only one that has completely forgotten the anime hes watched over 5 years ago  then you can rewatch it better
can anybody tell me what are this paintings and how much they worth i found them and they look like they might be worth something maybe
  looks like a house by a lake to me
who is this 
  uh dont post loli dude
who is this

heh
  sorry its an old obscure inside joke you wouldnt get it      im glad somebody got it though
  her vagina bones
oh now i get it
i get what im supposed to see now too but i guess im just blind because i cant see it
  glad im not the only one who remembers this epic event in /jp/ history
wonder if the mod even cares
what is it
oh hahaha its the janny cat xd    epic
so what is that
  wait where is it  because i still dont see it
  i dont know what the fug its supposed to be but this is the original
fact keta draws the best 2hus
the joke is that oldschool warosu wolves used to shop janitor cats into touhou images to epicly troll the janitors and then moved on to claim that images without cats in them actually had something hidden in them in order to confuse the already paranoid janitor
  too innocent for me needs more meat and sexualization
i remember when i used to add hidden text to images 2013 feels like a long time ago
is your homeboy beach body ready
  idiot
  at the pool with my homegirl
  nice epic i like it

this is too humane a punishment for the nefarious weeb mafia

when was the last time /b/ did something offsite together like cutting for bieber
voting for trump
  does /pol/ control /b/ now
  /b/ servers are owned by the fbi    /pol/ has become a sad version of what /b/ used to be /b/ died when you could only post if you had a pass
/b/ hasnt been the activity center of the website for years youll only see things like that in /v/ /tv/ and /pol/
  other way around
  /b/ servers are owned by the fbi  newfag detected go on post the pic you think proves it you idiots are so preoccupied with pretending to be knowledgeable or redpilled as you kids say today you end up believing and spouting any crap that comes your way
recently they voted garfield kart as game of the year on steam
  well thats something i guess
  /b/ died when you could only post if you had a pass  wasnt that this year /b/ died long before that kiddo
  /pol/ is a part of what /b/ used to be  mainly the part where some news event happened and you want to see how people on 4chan react to it  and loweffort trolling to fill the gaps  other pieces are scattered around the other boards
unfortunately we cannot accept paypal or credit cards at this time  good bye friends my pass ends tomorrow my ip is banned for no reason and i sure as shit aint playing with cryptoshit

stay here purp
this fucking nerd literally spends the entire day quiet and depressed doing nothing but watching anime and studying physics    then out of nowhere he starts talking with his internet friends on his mic commentating some video game and the fucking nerd is crying laughing literally crying laughing over being able to see his internet butt buddies      is this how cringy you fuckers look  i mean jesus christ who the fuck cries laughing talking with people on the internet this is the gayest this ive seen ever  you fucking homos when were watching hentai together next time you better not make like my twink roommate and cry laughing over internet friends  at least not be a total fucking twink loser if youre going to cry laugh    the worst part is when i tell him to shut up he just takes off the mic and starts typing to his friends  like he doesnt then look in the mirror and think how much of a fucking sheltered homosexual weeb he looks he just types to his internet friends  and  surprise surprise  hes a steam fag who does steam chat with his frens  so  let this be a lesson to all the teenshits who are in the /qa/ steam chat trevor
stop making threads
he could spend his whole day blogposting and failing accounting instead
  suck his dick

is it just me or did /b/ used to have a way of preserving images after the thread died for a little while so you could still click on and load them
  might be cloudflare caching them
  why did it stop doing it then
  are you sure its stopped and not just dependent on some factor you havent identified
  why would it change
  not just you
why do mods on /v/ sticky those dumb pepe posts  theyre not even that good

  isnt it weird that they choose the red pill from the matrix as the symbol of their truth yet get all their information from an anonymous imageboard that clearly tells you in big red text that everybody on here lies surely when you get to those levels of confirmation bias something in your brain starts telling you that youre losing touch with reality
    they wish so fervently to live in an alternate reality with alternative facts and extremist/radical farright ideologies that they dont even think about confirmation bias they only think about how to reinforce the narrative they circlejerk around all day
  i think the strangest/saddest thing is when you look through /pol/ and yes of course they have extreme political views not a big shock to anyone who has used this site for more than a few years but they so clearly use phrases like useful idiot and speak about ways to turn people into supporting their ideology    thats the craziest part for all their fervent support behind their farright ideals they clearly understand that they have to fool or manipulate people into supporting them they know that their ideas are crazy and not natural and require coercion and propaganda to get people to believe them    at what point does your brain even allow you to believe in something to this extent despite the fact it also knowing that its completely stupid how do you firmly wholeheartedly believe that all black people must die while at the same time understanding that you have to deceive people into seeing this point of view because its too ludicrous for any normal person to swallow    thats the strangest and stupidest thing about /pol/ its not their beliefs which are just different from ours its the fact that they themselves know those beliefs are stupid yet continue to believe them its like selfaware cognitive dissonance taken to the next level
why not just forget about 4chan and go to twitter theres a bunch of anime and hentai artists there its also the most popular social network in japan so you can talk to actual japanese people about your otaku related hobbies
weebs dont know the language well enough to talk to the japanese

welcome to /qa/  question  answer    this is a board for the discussion of meta topics and  other things  outside of meta this board has no specific theme and you are free to be yourself please note all global rules are inforce here
is there an easy way to speak with 4chan staff what if i have something i want to contribute to 4chan that i dont think will get seen on /qa/
  
  
the answers you seek lie within
voice actors wanted      her name is clover    do you want to apply to be 4chan vtubers voice actor  please post your voice acting url
unlist /qa/
second for unlist /qa/
voice actors  so exclusively males then
unlist /qa/   make /s4s/ blue and then make it s4s again
    hiroyuki is drunk again
  why not allow mp4 files on /qa/
  she will represent 4chan or 4channnel
  since there are two sites now maybe we should have two vtubers instead of doing another design we could just use the same one with a different colour pallet something blue for safe for work boards  we could call her aqua
  cheeky
  sounds good to me they should both be on the same yt channel doing vtuber things
hiro please put christmas keksandra logo on front page 
wont forget
  so many better designs out there   and everyone chose an aqua trace
  well you never had the option to pick the one you replied to to begin with hiro will never explain this
third for unlist /qa/
  test
  well  did it work
eighteenth for unlisting /qa/ wouldnt help
  aqua trace  i dont see it
  nice joke faggot
    pls respond

delete /pol/
  cute
i hope someone will find you and put a knife in your back the same way fucking greedy shit
create /ko/  lolikon  shotacon on 4chanorg then everything is forgiven
  go fuck yourself
  i unironically hope one of the autists on here shoots you in the fucking head     no lie
  shouldnt she be in burqa so as to coincide with the sfw policy
  are you fat or do you just have a headcold    fumbling her way through making videos to entertain anons  oh great shy anime girl fucking snore
  we had a billion scripts in the last sticky but hiroshimoot nagasakied the thread so heres the archive     also this gave me worst blue balls
the voice actor will speak nip right getting americans to do it will be trash just like dubbed anime
  theres no set personality yet so id love to hear your ideas until notmoot tells me the official description of her if you want a different perspective    ill browse through and do a few takes of these thanks
  look at      does she look shy and fumbling to you she looks like a little shithead that likes to fuck with people but still knows how to clean it up when its required of her think umaruchan instead of timid moeblob 3472
give up
  and this tiny flatchested loli is actually a hundred year old vampire who can transform into a wolf to rip you to shreds it just wasnt drawn yet  its just concept art it doesnt tell absolutely everything that the femanon might need second for smug and trolling personality though
  its art that got voted on and won obviously there were other designs that drew on different personality types but those werent chosen but i see where youre coming from i just know the vtuber space is infected with the shy anime girl meme and it was already old 10 years ago    also vampire outfit for halloween confirmed
is anyone finding it odd how this thread is between the two other sticky threads logically speaking since this thread has the most recent replies it should be the first thread however  is still on top does that sticky thread have an added priority    does that mean that 4chan have some kind of super sticky option
  that thread is both older and locked
  thats not how the sticky feature works if locked sticky threads had priority over normal sticky threads  would be above this thread but its not and  is also older than this thread
  admin sticky has priority over mod sticky and stickys are listed by post date i guess
   is also older than this thread  its not
  i read that as pm not am    why the hell does a hiro thread not even have 100 replies after over 12 hours the last time hiro posted on /qa/ the thread was reaching 100 replies a minute also there are tons of female vas who make threads voice acting for random anons all the time youd think when the administrator of the site asked for vas there would be tons popping out everywhere
  everyone realized hiro is the japanese jew
    no one cares about this shit anymore splitting the site killed it fuck this subhuman insectoid
  why the hell does a hiro thread not even have 100 replies after over 12 hours  because in this case he just shows up once a week says nothing of relevance and then fucks off for another week expecting someone to do all the job for him because he has no idea what hes doing  i place my bet on the heat death of the universe being a thing before the first video
      my time got cut short so i didnt get too much done ill be back tomorrow when i dont have to share the apartment for the night let me know if it sounds better/needs improvement/is cringy  
  why dont you use vocaroo
  is this another way to make money hiro
  pls no flash is shit
  yes he planned this from the start the vtuber is supposed to become the friendly new mascot for 4chan he plans to sell merchandise of her  nendos  figmas  dakimakuras  tshirts  posters  onaholes  licensing to other companies to make more cash  selling doujinshis    hes going to capitalize on her funny that image related is a better design
  honestly with the shitty reputation 4chan has who would even buy 4chan based clothing except for degenerates and the ironic normies
  the same people that buy pepe and wojak tshirts
  i feel like that also falls under degenerates and ironic normies its like the ahego clothing at first it had some shock value but now its just irocnic memesters wearing them fucking everywhere
  its like ragefaces
  i wonder how much money people selling memeshirts even get i see them advertising all the time on social media
  better quality
  are you familiar with sally amakis vtuber anyway this one reminded me of her with the fumbling around it doesnt necessarily say shy but gives a feel of being amateur but having the guts to take it couple it with a bit of smug and youre good    first one is better than  i get that people want le edgy people are retarded xddd 4channer rreee but it doesnt make good charisma sure if you spit out slurs every now and then its acceptable but i dont think that should be the set personality    as for quality i really cant say for sure unless we have a model but going off concept art its a pass shift in tones would be nice though as people would trance out if you speak in a constant high tone
hello admin my friend im getting this when i try to make threads while i can post in the threads normally please fix this bugs  regards sadfrogs
  m8 you fucking split 4chan into a shit the fuck is the point
s c r e w  c o n g o i d s
  stop being autistic admins can do whatever they want
  if this piques anyones interest i can be reached here  for general work purposes i might be looking for voices for a game in the next year
op is a faggot
  slowly getting rid of 4chans identity one update at a time eh
  the artist then receives no cent from all the merchandise  kek
  hello sir whats the pay
  free 4chan for hore rife
  damn we really did get the most advertiserfriendly version huh shame we missed out on cooler designs like these    tired gamer gf when
  voice actors wanted  we know you will not pay a single cent to them so why dont you get some texttospeech program and cut the middle man
  moon man is much more fitting
  thanks for useful feedback anon until theres serious offers ill leave things asis since these are good enough in their own for simple auditions but ill remember your advice if by some mistake/miracle i get the gig    i dont see why not im no professional by any means and all my work has been unpaid/hobby in case you needed someone with real experience
did we ever get any vote statistics back  im honestly almost certain that gookmoot just picked this one out because he thought it was cute
  if this is the case we should fucking riot  or go to fullchan    regardless i dont feel represented by this moeblob she makes me think of a mouthful of sawdust hell even moe anime does autistic otaku girl proper
  not that i saw none of the entries were archived either i had to google that shit id post a link but its probably filtered
    im gonna be honest with you guys im legitimately worried about the future of 4chan now trying to mix 4chan and money is like trying to mix yoghurt and piss its a fundamentally bad idea thats not going to end well hiro could quite literally destroy this site
  pretty sure one of the lolis would have won either way but chink moot wouldnt allow her to not be advertiser friendly
did this greedy chink address any of the concerns or complaints about the split
  yup all rights of the winning design is turned to hiro      hiro bought the site for the sole purpose of milking profits off it whether it be bitcoin miners selling user information selling 4chan passes ad revenue 4chan merchandise vtuber video revenue vtuber merchandise and so on he just wants money
  i could handle his greed to some extent if he at least fucking communicated his plans and intentions  at this point he just shits out obvious cash grab ideas and never asks for feedback or opinions  he doesnt interact at all with the site unless its a direct admin duty that will make him money and his mods are just left to their own devices while he does something else  he doesnt understand any board culture or history of the site and doesnt care for its users in any way    i miss moot and the site should have been nuked with his departure
  go sing some more songs roco
  you sound like a shitty dub dude acting too much feels unnatural i wouldnt say thats worse than natsumi moe though still sucks
  they should have made a patreon a long time ago this was moots mistake all the moralfags that were against it can eat dicks look the state of the site now
yikes
  patreon would have banned 4chan because of /pol/ anyway
double yikes
not just giving her a man voice
  inb4 nyanners and runka chunks apply for va
  not just making her a he  fucking missed opportunity    also why did i have to do eleven goddamn captchas
  make her a trap and voiced by mister metokur
  test
  disable javascript
  fuck
  pretty good for having almost no information sounds like you at least take it seriously  good luck to you
  good luck with that faggot jew gook i hope you die in a fire like all jews did
  this was my autistic attempt at it  rate my vtuber
  clover as a face  open the gate  aubrey plaza voice  close the gate  wide hips  open the gate a little
  the overall idea behind it is its supposed to be the antithesis of the moeblob
who cares the site is split
  post it in the /d/ girls with replaced heads thread
  its not meant to be fetishbait though
  sorry but i already fapped
  nope because he chose the mascot himself the vote was just a front
  to what  she doesnt exactly have defining features
  girls with objects as heads are a niche fetish
  i see your point  still kinda bummed out about the winner but i didnt really expect mine to win anyways  nothing gained nothing lost
  its not like the winner gets royalties from the merchandise sold anyway
  everything that gets made here is definitely public domain and always has been so thats already a given
    exactly for how long is this meme will persist    i bet that if the site were to use sfw4chanorg and nsfw4chanorg you manchildren will be seething as well please let that sink in
  until its no longer true i imagine
  
  wat dis
  implying sjwers would ever apply to anything even related to this epic site 4channel   
  mfw we couldve had l00ti as the vtuber but instead we have to deal with hiro and this mess  this is the price you pay for freedom
  those names should be blacklisted for these kind of projects
  mister metokur  im actually really in favor of this
  imagine being this gay
  i mean a lot of people on vrchat do it
    ok now imagine being this gay
  i never asked for this

hmmmmmmm

hiroyukiの意見どうだった何の返事がないやっぱおかしいだろう せめてスレのオーデション声優にちゃんと告げて下さいませんか
  eceleb  go away lole
  hiroyukiの意見どうだった何の返事がないやっぱおかしいだろう せめてスレのオーデション声優にちゃんと告げて下さいませんか  hiroshimoot doesnt know what the fuck hes doing
  whoever is watching /v/ at this time and over the last few hours probably need the boot
  maybe update the global announce nobody knows about this new thread    the 4chan vtuber competition is over click here to see the winning entry is very old
  go ahead flood this board with literal children
  other than the board moving even faster its not like the content itself would change very much
  here to say again that whoever is watching /v/ right now may need to be fired for incompetence and insubordination in the us you can fire someone for this and not have to answer many questions look it up if you didnt know we fired 2 people for this in the last year before selling the business and for not enforcing the rules appropriately as well as shitposting with content that damages the reputation of the website making it ineligible to most advertising firms    answer me hiro i said you have delicate eyes and i am legitimately concerned about the website
  kys
    he thinks this is resetera website    fuck off this isnt ur safe space hugbox
  that image isnt ok delete it now or you lose your shels mr hiro
unlist /qa/ make sage visible on /jp/
  assuming she wants to associate with us ever again  lurk moar newfriend
another reminder that hiro doesnt want to put any of his own time or skin into this project he has present no clear plans on how this will move forward and only makes posts when some anon makes progress for him he has shown no meaningful interest in this project
  what do you expect from someone who decide to split the site all of a sudden and making it worse
  i expect other people to not take this project seriously at risk of them being taken advantage of i also dont want to have to see my youtube recs flooded with youtube personalities talking about this shit when some 10 sec teaser is released and nothing else ever happens
  bahahaha this pls
  go back to whichever shithole you crawled out from nigger
this pile of radioactive shit thinks that women/female/vagina will show up here post their acting and shit choice an imitation of the most popular youtube whore and make her works for free
  this will happen though women are so obessed with attention und popularity they would do it for free too pathetic desu senpai
this mascot is cute and all but when will someone draw porn of her
what exactly is the point of this vtuber and kinds of videos will she be making much like every other incoming change to the site hiro hasnt told the users a single fucking thing while simultaneously asking for help
  an obtuse lets play channel for /v/  an anime review for /a/  weapons stress tests for /k/  and all that kinds of shit  its just a dedicated eceleb for the site
  so shit
  hiroshima wants beef with aichan

hey hiro fire they guy protecting this thread 
  give him a raise instead at least one hotpcket

how is hiro so hilariously incompetent  he manages to be destructive and oblivious at the same time while putting literally no effort into anything and fully showcasing his greed with zero results  you could pick any random teen from a shit board to be his assistant and the site would immediately improve
    r8 my audition  also nth to unlist /qa/
whoever wins has to sign a blood contract promising never to support sjw politics
  thats anti freedom of speech sir

marasmius rotula the pinwheel mushroom is a fungus in the family marasmiaceae widespread in the northern hemisphere it was first described scientifically in 1772 by mycologist giovanni antonio scopoli the mushrooms are characterized by thin whitish caps up to 2 cm 08 in wide that are sunken in the center and pleated with scalloped margins the wiry black hollow stalks measure up to 80 cm 31 in long by 15 mm 006 in thick on the underside of the caps are widely spaced white gills attached to a collar encircling the stalk the mushrooms grow in groups or clusters on decaying wood such as fallen twigs and sticks mosscovered logs and stumps spore release is dependent upon sufficient moisture dried mushrooms may revive after rehydrating and release spores for up to three weeks much longer than most gilled mushrooms although the mushrooms are not generally considered edible they produce a unique peroxidase enzyme that is attracting research interest for use in bioengineering applications

  i swear i just did it as a joke and i didnt even think the meme was funny to begin with  still posts videos with her slutty loli voice constantly  has always teased the perverts in the audience with shit like the watermelon video  why did she think any of her old fans would believe a word of this
  shes dumb
  fuck off retard
you fuck offget your own thread
  free  woah now hiro will starve at that rate hed be happy to give you 20 off though for your work
  youll get a life times worth of hotpockets
  kek
  second this
  nah
  gay ya na
  there are like twenty or thirty better designs and none of them have bright green hair
you must be blind
maybe you shouldnt be asking anons on 4chan
  why would a non 4channer represent a literal 4channer idiot
hiro please look    
  4channer  there is no demonym for users of 4chan/nel dumb redditor
  a board for videomaking beginners and hobbyists and a place to contain ecelebshit thats actually not a bad idea  too bad hiro probably wont heed its advice
  and a place to contain ecelebshit  so its /mlp/ /vg/ /vp/ etc all over again we make a board to contain something and it becomes stronger
  mlp cancer has mostly remained on mlp save for some trolls looking for easy yous  /vg/ is working exactly as intended  /vp/ is working as intended  i dont see the problem
    its a combination of wanting to be a paid voice actor but having ones debut on 4chan with lewd lolis and sjw friends who she took seriously we lost her
  what a retard lmao
  the problem is that giving them a place makes them think they are accepted everywhere else when theyre just a nuisance fucking /pol/ was supposed to be a containment board and is now the biggest board because people have an unrestricted place to talk about politics making a new board for ecelebs will cause twittertier drama and have the board become a cesspool in no time  if you want to contain eceleb shit throw it into /trash/ like we did with furries and enforce the fucking rules /v/ /news/ and /int/ are the biggest examples of how a containment board wont contain shit if the board itself becomes bigger than the original one/s it spinned off of  a board for videomaking sounds good but people already use /g/ for that and we have /3/ and /gd/ for the rest the only thing that comes to mind would be the recycling of /f/ now that flash is dying but as you said hiro wont do shit and if he does hell make it without even knowing what it is for and it will fail miserably
  /pol/ wasnt a containment board  /trash/ should get deleted we dont need it     /v/ /news/ and /int/ are the biggest examples of how a containment board wont contain shit if the board itself becomes bigger than the original one/s it spinned off of  not sure what you mean by this im confused    a board for videomaking sounds good but people already use /g/ for that  /g/ doesnt get much traction because its all a bunch of tech heads its not a good entry point for casuals who just have a passion for being in front of a camera or behind a microphone the tech is the hobby the act of production is not
  no more subboards
  i dont use it therefore we dont need it
  /trash/ invites undesirables
  /pol/ wasnt a containment board  i phrased that poorly my bad i meant to say that it functions as a containment board for political discussion  /trash/ should get deleted we dont need it  u wot m8 explain your thoughts behind this    not sure what you mean by this im confused  i meant to point out countless sjwbashing threads on /v/ racebait threads on /int/ and /news/ being just /pol/lite when a thread about us politics pops out  /g/ doesnt get much traction because its all a bunch of tech heads its not a good entry point for casuals who just have a passion for being in front of a camera or behind a microphone the tech is the hobby the act of production is not  thats why i said that maybe recycling /f/ would be a good idea we already have people with knowhow there that could help
  i meant to say that it functions as a containment board for political discussion  no it doesnt one of the biggest myths there is about 4chan is that we need /pol/ to keep all those crazies contained we really dont those drama junkies will just fuck off if /pol/ was deleted because they need their fix and theyre not going to get it here    u wot m8 explain your thoughts behind this  we were doing well expunging the furries without /trash/ the function of trash is to contain the shitposters of off topic threads by moving those threads out of site however mods rarely use this function off topic threads typically just get deleted they dont make the effort to move the thread to /trash/ so what is /trash/ for exactly well its just a furry hangout now  thats not the pretext of the boards creation so if we dont need furries on 4chan and if the mods arent using /trash/ for its intended purpose then why not simply delete it its useless they should have never allowed thread creation on that board    i meant to point out countless sjwbashing threads on /v/ racebait threads on /int/ and /news/ being just /pol/lite when a thread about us politics pops out  ah ok thats what i kind of thought but i wasnt sure well truth be told swj tampering is in the video game industry right now so its a hard topic to avoid talking about im all for deleting /pol/ though but i know it wont happen because the admins like that board
hiro is dumb and i dont like him
  i dont think anyone does
  those drama junkies will just fuck off if /pol/ was deleted  youre delusional if you think /pol/ would not provoke the biggest shitstorm the site has ever seen if it were deleted the least of our problems would be dealing with the constant raids ddos attacks  /pol/ is not going anywhere because were the only place that allows them to run wild once the beast is released the only way to put it back in its cage is to kill it    agree on /trash/ not being used properly but having it as an invisible useless fucking shit bin is good if furries were not there theyd just move somewhere else be it /b/ /aco/ /bant/ etc and shit it up    swj tampering is in the video game industry right now  if youre talking about neofag dying for a while or stuff like censorship on ps4 games then yes its bound to happen but when 10 different threads are active at the same time because of the same thing it becomes a problem
i must congratulate you for bringing back google ads after 15 years not even moot could put that one off
this threads turned into hiroyuki general
  it wasnt that
what the heck is wrong with the latest steamvr update  playspace always above the ground and sometimes tens of meters away  chaperone will no longer turn off without reducing the activation distance to 0  half the time nothing renders in the headset  no longer detects the headset for playspace calibration
  ignore this
  vr is a meme gimmick fad that is already over
  whyd you make this thread if you yourself have no interest also fix the goddarned captcha
  hopefully because he realized fixing problems is more important than throwing another thing in the giant pile of 4chan stuff

share whatever dreams youve had    i recently had a dream in which there were girls and a barber in an early grade school like classroom and the girls were talking among each other and with the barber i forget exactly what was said but it was mostly casual conversation and at some point the barber cut intoone of the girls ears and she screamed and then the barber became more intense with cutting the girls hair and was starting to do a bad job at this point yet the casual conversation continued despite what was happening and the girl whose ear was cut was also participating then it ended abruptly without any payoff for the tension
been having a lot of dreams about my hometown recently its weird i havent seen most of these people in years
  with parts made in japan
  im not a robot without emotions
nah i already shared one a couple days ago never saw the thread again
//dreamchnet  go back
what am i supposed to take away from very infrequently reoccurring dreams
had a dream about my cat again i miss my cat
  not too unusual when i dream its usually a mashup of random points in my life from childhood to today
i had another dream about having friends with which i ate various celestial entities
  whatever you like i never bought the dreams having deep meanings story
ive been having nightmares lately not the scary kind but emotionally draining and depressing kind it hurts i wish life didnt turn out like this
  during sleep or during waking life
recently ive been noticing that ive been slipping into dreams without even realizing it and it seems like im still awake and just going about my day as normal but then i wake up and find out things arent going as i had imagined its a bit odd
  what kinds of celestial entities
my dad threw me a birthday party at this old hotel  or maybe it was his birthday  and gave me a sweater told me to keep it as proof this happened this wouldnt have been an issue if he hadnt felt a little crazy the guy was raving got into a political argument over an idol i like  i thought he was gonna shoot up the place so i told my mom he mightve been planning something and we snuck out    we didnt get in the car we circled the hotel and encountered an older building then hid beneath it  i remember saying to her mom we shouldve gotten in the car we shouldve left before waking up which is a great thing ive had enough nightmares to know how that was gonna play out     interesting  facts   the people looked at me in disgust  the sweater was grey and had some rainbow pattern on the front it mightve been a cardigan   the hotel had an ambient golden light which wasnt warm as youd expect but sickening  we hid by sliding through a gap on the buildings foundations so we were lying in mud and staring up at piping the ceiling thats not what its called i guess but thats the word im using was high it was rather cozy      stars planets something sparkly titled andromeda its blurry now
hope i have some nice dreams tonight
  same
sweet dreams
  what if youre dreaming right now
i dreamed i was playing in a firstperson perspective rpg with oldtimey graphics think betrayal at krondor set in some kind of fantasy setting first i was in a pit inside an underground arena fighting houndlike monsters then i was in a different openair arena where there was a huge armored guy who dualwielded hammers he gave a monologue before we fought i dont remember what it was about but it made me really angry after i beat him a cute girl who i guess was my best friend in the dream ran down from somewhere and hugged and kissed me later she got kidnapped by an evil wizard/warrior in an iron mask and i had to rescue her i fought my way through the bad guys mansion and reached some tower at the top i fought him and he went down pretty easily i was like huh that guy wasnt so tough for a final boss but then he transformed into a giant halfcrystal halforganic demon with tentacles i beat him and rescued the girl but she told me that i was too dangerous and she didnt love me anymore for some reason then i was arrested and exiled from the city i was in
  thatd be real spooky who knows how long ive been dreaming
  checking from time to time in real life helps with lucid dreaming apparently
  thats a nice site
i had a dream where i met with two friends i had in highschool and one was acting really weird and told me that he distrusted the other one for stealing or murdering and i immedietly believed him and told the other one that i thought he was guilty to his face  and then after investigation he was totally innocent and i woke up feeling like shit
  i had a dream the other night that i was at some school ive never been to in real life and there was a colossal mech in the quad area that had glowing purple appendages extending from its back for some reason i walked out underneath the mech and some sort of grabbing arm emerged from its posterior which seized me by the head crushing my skull and killing me instantly
  look at your clock and then look at it again
  maybe he was a witch and subverted your investigation
want to dream of fun things
  did you die in real life as the legends say
  at least you can be together again in dreams
how do i get in the habit of waking checks its not something that occurs to me to do unless im thinking about lucid dreaming
  its more important to form a habit of thinking hey what was weird was i dreaming then just spamming reality checks    most of the time i think you only do reality checks when youre semiludic anyway and it makes you fully lucid  like doing a dream journal and intending to be lucid is the most important    hope you find it a bit helpful
how do people improve their retention of the dreams they have to the point that they are able to perfectly write down/recall them
  have you tried starting a dream journal  remembering dreams is just practice and even if you can only remember the barest fragments at first write them down and recall will improve
  oh really i had never really thought about writing down the fragments of my dreams and have only concentrated on my easier to recall ones ill try out that and see if i can finally start to remember my dreams more often than thrice a year
  goodluck anon i think your dreams will get freaking crazy when you realize whats going on in there
  i find it helps to write them down immediately the longer i wait the more i forget
delicious dreams
dreamt i was a worm a big one like in dune digging holes in the ground and jumping out of them
  whats the craziest dream youve had
  one where there was an entity that knew i was lucid dreaming and trying to wake up and tortured me with tons of false awakenings and horror stuff
  but she told me that i was too dangerous and she didnt love me anymore for some reason  ungrateful wench
  guess what anon youre still in it
does being comfy make you more or less likely to remember your dreams
  good wake up slowly and ponder and appreciate your dreams in total comfort  bad startle and forgot everything
  what sort of weird things happen that make you doubt yourself when youre awake
  thanks for the tips ill give it a shot
still havent remembered any dreams this week
has anyone ever lucid dreamed and managed to summon an anime girl before  i tried a bunch of times while lucid and never got it
  i can pretty much summon any regular objects and portals to places ect so i know the mechanics for it  just anime girls never work
whats your favorite thing to dream about
hoping for some nice dreams tonight
maybe tonight ill remember something
dreamed of posting onqa/ and it seemed normal at first but then oddities were occurong like jevin impersonation varappi lots of different thresds i cant remember and the dream emded with what seemed like a banned notice but instead of saying you are banned it just said fuck you
    i wonder why that is
  i thought it was that my brain didnt know how to make it look but then later im pretty sure i met a 2d anime character in a non lucid dream
my dreams tend to alternate between different scenarios that are still somehow linked  last night for example some people i knew threw someone else into a grinder after that i was in a cave filled with bright and shining crystals transition to descending through a deep ocean together with someone deeply concerned about it to a train and being unable to move to bristol because people were following me
i dreamt that instead of picking chimneys and hydrants captcha started giving multiplechoice questions about your attitudes toward certain products and social/political issues you were expected to sometimes read a wall of text for each answer and pick the one that you agreed with most    i didnt want to read them because i thought theyd be phrased in a way that would subtly manipulate my thinking and gradually reeducate me but i also didnt want to pick at random since i was worried about picking libshit answers and giving a false impression about the boards atmosphere i hate stressful dreams
bump
  thats scarily realistic
no dreams while sick why cant i just be allowed to have nice dreams when im sleeping all the time
  do you remember if it looked 2d
  pretty sure she did  it looked like an asanagi drawing
page 1
sweet dreams 4chan
dreams are fun wish i remembered more of them
going to sleep  i doubt ill remember my dreams since i normally dont but here we go
going to try for some more dreams
  good luck
  if it had been in the reason message it wouldnt have been unheard of
dreamed i was a cute girl making things more comfortable for /qa/ boys
everytime i set myself out to start lucid dreaming i lose motivation half way and give up wish there was an easier way that didnt involve drugs or discipline
meet qt girl  its like we already know eachother perfectly  understanding without even talking  wake up    ty
    mysterious
fought a guy in a small food bar for the right to a meal he shot me in the face then ate my body
  did you experience the being dead and being eaten part what was it like  if you had won would you have eaten him
i should spend more time fantasizing  i should spend more time in real world
  i didnt get to since i switched pov and kind of warped into another dudes body he asked the monster who i was then hopped over the doormat and left   did i mention he the victor turned into a mass of flesh and holes to eat me probably shouldve mentioned that  and no if i had won i would have gotten a nice plate of crispy potatoes and steak
dreaming of an even better /qa/
about to go to sleep hope i have good dreams
  need more details
still no dreams for 3 weeks now
  dreamed that i got a bike and rode it around  saw a cool guy on a skateboard  fast forward to later that day and i see the same guy  i say hey i saw you earlier youre pretty cool i was wondering how do i go fast  he chuckles like larry the lobster and says oh dude heres how you go fast   then he shoves something up my nose picture a golf pencil but completely strawberry pink and covered in sugar crystals like a pretzel would be salted   i sniff and immediately feel a burning  i thank him and start peddling really fast up a hill and even manage to launch off the hill like a ramp  soaring through the air i quickly realize that i went way too fast and that i wont be able to land properly  i slam my shoulder into a stoplight and blackout    it was a nice dream because i talked to someone and they werent repulsed by me i think thats why i peddled so hard because i was happy    woke up in the dream in a completely different place and went back to find that my bike wasnt stolen
  also i most likely had this dream because i saw a lot of people riding those bikes that look like normal bikes but you dont have to peddle and i thought wow have i been mispelling pedal this whole time wow those look cool i want one
keep having separate dreams revolving around a mansion with a dining room stacked with food at first it was just filled for an event but then thanksgiving happened and now it just shows up as a place with 1 week old food thats in the same exact place and looks exactly the same though nobody eats it or does anything about it
mfw have trouble remembering dreams or putting them into words and end up forgetting  mfw most of my dreams are like vidya but i cant replay them ever again  not a recent dream but i once had a dream where i was in some postapoc/stalker scenario and i was just exploring this abandoned apartment building around 711th story when i got into this small apartment room about the size of two queen beds from end to end and noticed out the window that someone was walking along the grey pavement outside  i think it was a girl and i simply observed her from up there    anyone know how to remember dreams better
i was looking for torrents of anime i dont remember much i think in the end i was watching something where some of the characters were much larger than the others
  wtf kek
  not much other than what ive already said i wish i remembered more dreams too
how do you promote nice dreams i can promote nightmares but that isnt very useful
  how do you promote nightmares
  have nice things happen to you during the day  i find that if something meaningful hapoens to me ill dream about something related/similar to it later
had some really nice dreams
man i had a hecked up dream  i got castrated and my phone exploded and then i had to help my dad who had become crippled out of bed but no one would help me put out a fire as the building was starting to burn down
  sounds like a fun one to think up psychological interpretations of
  it was after i watched a lecture on freud it felt like a parody and i was lying there thinking my god what does that mean after lol
  i wonder what affects how often you have dreams
doesnt smoking marijuana make you stop dreaming
dreamt i was back in nam
  first off i got ostrasized and like kicked out from my job and replaced before all that other stuff it was like i was humilaited infront of everyone and kicked out and everyone hated me before the other stuff  and with the phone exploding first there was this horrible sinister feeling and within the space of maybe 30 seconds all that shit happened one after another the castration phone exploding dad crippled fire starting  sinister feeling is the worst i get it in nightmares all the time  it makes even mundane things feel terrifying
  how did you get castrated did you get a rubber band or did someone go snip snip or were they just magicked away witch style
  there was a bunch of stiches there but i never experienced it happening
last night i dreamt that kaos from comic girls had become a successful mangaka and she was showing her manuscripts to a test audience to see if theyd like it and they did then it cut to tohru from dragonmaid making a face exactly like pic related and being like  and that was the dream i had
had a dream that everyone i knew decided to abandon me nearly had sex with a loli i know but got caught and then i learned that one of my close relatives killed themselves it was not a good sleep but at least it was all a dream
  wouldnt know about that
had a dream about /qa/ someone had made a thread about a youtube channel about styling pages with css
had a dream with lots of 2d anime girls   first i went to to local hobby model store that was really someones shared apartment and looked at their dioramas and stuff but that just set the theme     next me and whoever i was with went to this other place and it was completely filled with dozens of 2d anime girls running around doing stuff like just relaxing or playing table tennis or practicing judo and stuff  the guy who owns the place leads us to his computer and drawers where he pulls out some really nice anime drawings and sells them to the other guy i keep trying to hint at him where all these real life anime girls came from like uhh so hes the artist for all these lol   and he gives me an ip address to a server that can sell me anime pictures or something    right before this there was a dream where my and my friend did a mass shting and i feel like that edgy dream unlocked the anime girls doesnt make sense but thats what it felt like    then there was another dream with anime girls which was that i was taking a standadized test to become a doctor or something but a bunch of the questions were joke questions  so i went to the test ovverseeer to complain and he just took my test and said oh well that was your only chance so i had to join the military in a hoplite unit with spears and the first test was swimming and then as i was swimming slowly overaking everyone because in the story im a buffed out ripped spartan warrior then kuro from prisma illya is swimming ahead of me until we reach the edge of the pool and we pull up out of the water and im lying there exausted looking up and kuro is standing there in her swimsuit with illya next to her and im looking at their butts from below but then i look away  smiling but they were very cute
  did you watch a lot of anime the day before
  i got an anime sticker and hung out with my sister all day is all i can think of
  but why did you dream of a golf pencil but completely strawberry pink and covered in sugar crystals like a pretzel would be salted
  never smoked weed but i feel like i dont dream as much as most people
i had a dream where a guy put on a strap on because his wee wee was too small
i dreamt about doomfist slamming someone into a wall
  what about taking lsd
dreamt i went on a bus ride with a cute girl but had to change my clothes in a horrible dingy bathroom once we got to our destination
has anyone ever had a drema where theyre the opposite gender
i dreamed i was back in high school and i had to make up a test but instead of giving me a written test the teacher decided to give me an oral exam it involved a question about a baby trying to break down a door and after a while of me asking him questions and proposing solutions and asking him to repeat details he left the classroom and headed to the staff room and i followed him still trying to solve his riddle at this point he seemed annoyed that was where the dream ended
start shitposting thread on /tv/ with what are some movies  still gets deleted  how did they do this  how did they realize that its a ruse
  maybe because its been posted 6 billion times already
probably because you always attach a dumb frog to your op theres a reason you get called that name
  this is also why the templated anime question threads on this board are so obviously spam
  being this mad  lol
  just pointing out the fact that you basically leave a calling card that makes you easily trackable  the fact that you didnt understand this kind of proves the point that youre a dumbass
  we are falseflagging the frogposters now  i swear i could write my sociology thesis on the behaviour of this board
  its about time some subtle shitposting gets knocked down if only more was done against images and text that try similar things
  even if they werent shitposting you could always say what are some x threads could count as a request outside of /r/ and banned on sight anyway thats how /a/ curtailed it
  /tv/ has mods
we can figure this out
/qa/ has no board culture
  i unironically really really miss winterball
    xdd le funny board tans we hav cultur too guyse xd  ahem id like to adress the cringe that i feel for you
  go away crybaby
  seething
  go away crybaby
  damage control praise kek
  go away crybaby
  waaaah i can only have fun if i shit on people ((( kys weeb scum baka  sad op 4chan is 90 people like this faggot nowadays just give up and enjoy the memories we made
  go back to tumblr
a pairing with any combination of /bant/ /trash/ /qa/ and /s4s/ since theyre the boards where mods dump certain offtopic threads
  they are not dumped they are moved to a more appropriate place
  go away crybaby
  /bant/ /qa/ and /s4s/ ahould go as a group lamoe
  go away crybaby
  /qa/ should be some sort of chaperone for the whole site since here its where people come to bitch
come on its kinda fun
  all redditor should hang
  again
  go away crybaby
  any ideas for a drawfag
  4chan culture   group collaboration  mods ban this shit
  more proof /jp/ never was involved in the whole boardtan thing
  are you asking for a drawfag or are you the drawfag and youre asking for ideas
  5channel
  i am the drawfag asking for ideas
    /qa/ sitting in a corner ballroom if possible reading 
  im guessing s4s and /int/ are still together so maybe s4s being pampered by the twins of /u/ with hair braiding and some ideas for a ball dress
every couple gets their bodies switched everybody is unaware everybody tries to play along in their new body to impress their date  for example switch /co/ and /ck/ with /s4s/ and /int/ because those are the only couples i can think of right now
  conrad either has to be the bigtiddied aryan or the cute little autist his sister likes im thrilled with either
  some changes could improve this in the future  for example  dont try to do it every year maybe every two or three years  or you can set a theme for the occasion something like this  the theme was car racing but this time forgetting all the drama and just focusing in the main theme  or just a group of boards that goes on an adventure in a quest or being the guests in a game show
  /bant/ and /trash/ sitting at a corner table reminiscing on their statuses as trashcans
please ignore the pesky little pests and dont let them ruin it like last year    id love to see some sort of symbolic nod towards the split that happened this year
  the /sci/ character  i thought /sci/ was just yukari yakumo
super cringe
thanks for the board tan thread i actually miss the winter ball
  go away crybaby
  why the fug are /i/ /bant/ and /s4s/ so similar
  why do little girls of almost the same age look similar
the easiest theme to stick and be effective is christmas
  theyre mischievous little girls
  then they should get together and do something being 4chans loli tans
  a kissing harem
  males turned into females   why not
  llewd
what is the most dangerous situation youve been in
i was almost stabbed by gypsies
out of 4chan relevant thread topic ideas again huh
  all threads are relevant on the random boards check the report options on this boards theres no offtopic option
  this isnt a random board silly its the meta board
  i was going through psychosis and was almost stabbed by an irate homeless person in the middle of the night down by the river
  having an argument on 4chan
friend driving my truck at 80 mph when there was ice on the rode we spun out and hit the barrier then spun again and hit the barrier on the opposite side of the rode    only two barriers for a few miles

    because it takes me 30 minutes to do all the work for the day and after that im free to do whatever i want as long as i pretend to work sitting at my computer nigger
how much are the dumb nigger jannies and dumb nigger mods paid to clean up after basedposters what sort of monetary compensation are they eligible for
  its been rough surviving on reddit bros  er why its great theres no /pol/tards no bigotry racism sexism misogyny transphobia islamophobia or hatred we just talk about video games and be nice to one another as a respectable human being would do
  i havent done shit but the one i found keeps getting the few regions that do work rangebanned and im freaking out cause i wont be able to post at all at this rate
  t not a gentleman
  what do you do and dont you worry about the catalog having porn or some shit and having someone else see it
  we dont have any of those things here on 4channel friend
  um have you read this thread people are unironically saying the n word
  are you me
  if you can name a better website to browse for hours at a time to pass the slow parts of the day id love to hear it assuming 4channel doesnt work
  9gag where most the meme originate from
  dont worry the based mods will permaban these racists soon enough this is a new era for 4channel
  resetera
le cornerfrog
  reddit
  i would unironically appreciate this not because bigotry triggers me until the nice mods make it go away but because i want to talk about video games
did you know its healthy to fuck dogs
  if these fucktards werent be doing it free we could actually get paid to moderate this shit hole not gunna lie id do it
              
  why would you want to talk about video games here theres very little genuine discussion even if the threads arent completely messed up
  nothings stopping you you shitchugging reprobate theres tons of video game threads on the front page stop being a little bitch
  real question is whod willingly volunteer to sift through this garbage without pay
  yeah most of it is waifu bait shit or leak shit
    what do you do    keeping client database and some basic office work like checking emails once in a few hours    dont you worry about the catalog having porn    our it guy is based and redpilled so even if he can see what i browse he wont say anything and my cubicle is in a neat spot that no one can approach from behind
  living the dream i do the same thing its fucking amazing    tfw browsing cunny thread on /tv/  doesnt even matter cause im the it guy

  what the fuck
  male dog  gay
daily reminder that chinkmoot with nigger jannies are trying to turn 4chan into plebbit and its just a matter of time before they start banning left and right for anything remotely offensive and that can hurt adspace sales    you can either stay and behave like a good boy or move to a superior imageboard that respects your freedom of speech and which owner is completely open with how he runs things
  man 8 chans vidya board is shit the catalog is way too small has ugly borders around posts and there isnt even a script like 4chanx cripplechan has a lot of work to do before it can replace 4chins
run my own business  can do whatever the fuck i want including spend all day shitposting at work  dont because im too busy  tfw a slave to yourself
  said notices were filed for the following boards  /feet/ /vore/
based and redpilled
  same here keep being based
fell for the engineer meme  basically have the same hourly wage as operators   dont do engineering kids or you are really fucking passionate about dealing with people who hate you for no real reason writing official mails all day and other boring shits 12 hours everyday
hurts just a little bit
i just wanna go home i hate every second i spend in here
pass works on 4chan can make threads   pass does not work on 4channel because chinksect moot is retarded
well
  tfw no hueg megamare gf
why
  sweep it under the rug out of sight out of mind
  still based
  you really had to summon him didnt you
why move this to qa
  haha wow i didnt think of that
  the /qa/ schizo is barely alive with life support this is to encourage him to keep it up until he finally dies a wise strategist plays his enemies off on each other have the frgger exhaust himself to death on /qa/ and hope he inflicts damage on the other people which gather here the frgger doesnt even realize hes a golem manipulated by the mods
  wow you dont sleep much rage at frogposters keeping you awake again
  just because youre a schizo who bumps your threads every 14 hours 24/7 doesnt mean everybody else is similar    keep bumping those threads golem
  yikes i seem to have hit a bit too close to home
  dont comment how the mod moves a thread that should be deleted to /qa/ just so youve got something else to bump like a good golem  try and talk about my sleep schedule randomly  cringe everybody can see it schizo you do it for free and while dying
  based
my little brother just confirmed that 4channel isnt blocked on his high schools wifi   damn it

my uni is so based that never blocked 4chan
my uni is so based we have a whitelist
  is this your new homeboard lee hows your new deathcore band coming along
  thats based mine was like that      you go to a christian school or something
  this was the same at my workplace its nice when incompetence works in your favor  either that or whoever is in charge of the firewall posts on 4chan
      censorship in a university should raise red flags
  have you tried not getting banned on your main ip 
  kys
ive wondered how this works i thought id post while i was at the shopping centre a while back and the site was blocked how exactly did whoever is in charge of the shopping centres wifi determine that 4chan should be blocked
moving the thread instead of deleting it  utterly bizarre
  
  my campus has like 20 ip ranges and whenever one is currently banned i walk to another one haha
  
  muh dick  ooga booga
  first time on /qa/ champ

nice fangs
a continuation of the last thread  theres still a few things to discuss and once were all done i guess we finally bid farewell to an already dead site    in light of the news that 4chan might actually come to an end and jmoot wants more money i would like to remind everyone here that anons no longer exist in our times there may be a few stragglers from before but there are no new anons    i guess this is aimed at older anons late 20s or older but ive been wondering for the longest time why each batch of newfags since 2012 have become more hostile more bitter more repetitive more delusional somehow they have both grandiose and negative views of themselves more humourless with each passing year and ive come to the conclusion that classic underdog outcast nerd is dead with geek among most other subcultures merging with the mainstream and this being the safe space nobully generation almost everyone is catered for so to be an outcast gen z teenager now youd have to be a completely unlikeable humourless arsehole
s
  you mean f
  wow this ones going down fast nice digits though  t newfag of 2017 can definitely see what you all are mad about because the drop in quality is palpable want an alternative to muh /pol/ and muh /k/ taking suggestions ama
  theres no alternative this is the end of the line
  the greats of internet past had to go somewhere didnt they there has to be somewhere where things are still happening
  no sorry you missed your chance you got to the game too late also you just lost the game youre going to have to just wallow through the detritus of whatever the fuck this version of the internet is
barely an oldfag but an oldfag nonetheless
  i swear to god if ayn rand was right again and i just got atlas shrugged i am going to just admit that the niggers had it right all along when they acted like monkeys because this world doesnt make sense
  it doesnt make sense i doubt that it will make any sense until were well beyond it and we get a chance to look back objectively perhaps living through such a mindnumbing accumulation of mistakes the human race can finally grow
  i get to watch the internet adopt a phrase similar to who is john galt since success means you either get flooded with normies or fbi and every nonstandard avenue of communication is a honeypot  thanks me too    well the search continues i guess heres hoping that ayn rand was wrong about this
  no theres nothing left be content in the knowledge thatll you werent there to miss it now      rand
hold on to 4chan keep it in your hearts when its gone it may be gone forever but you do not need to succumb    
tfw if wow didnt exist you might have been an oldfag
  course it makes sense this is what happens when you let corporations control the flow of information the internet is just 90 garbage advertising these days
  tfw ill always be the cancer  at least im not an electionfag
  im not any more happy about it than you are but thats the situation most directly applicable to my problem
  im willing to wager you are the cancer youre here for funposting and memes and while you maybe dont raid other boards its too funny for you to tell anyone to fuck off
  kind of when i first showed up i saw someone mutilating a rat for yous and didnt come back for like three years then in 2017 a mix of being interested in that thing which had always been causing shit and just wanting to see the unique dynamics led me to try a second time but not go to /b/ i found myself unironically enjoying /pol/ even then and quickly stopped going to plebbit altogether reddit is only a good website if you dont know any better yeah im kind of guilty of that i still dont know what the appropriate amount of /pol/posting is and only partially understand that it is far less than is actually going on even though i wasnt here for the golden age of anything and the only way i can see any board going is down i can still see plainly that things used to be a lot better  its not all bad though ive been avatarfagging with my own screencaps just what i saw and thought was entertaining to show how quickly the change from plebbit to 4chan was only one of these caps made it to r/4chan and its one i havent posted yet
  i still dont know what the appropriate amount of /pol/posting is and only partially understand that it is far less than is actually going on    you cant fix it
  its because the users of the site are just getting older man zoomers dont use traditional forums period if only you knew how bad things really were etc
    when i checked overchan a year or so ago there were so many more imageboards listed but theyve since culled a lot of the dead ones     absolutely sad my home board was talking about creating a dedicated imageboard for a worst case scenario hopefully it comes to fruition soon
  on the contrary the older users have left mostly i suspect they either outgrew or just went to the respective forum/subreddits/real life equivalents of the blue hobby boards after 4chan when to shit    zoomers make up the bulk of 4chan now with their imitation of what they think an anon is
  4chan died in 2007 youre a decade too late
  started coming here in early 2008 when i was 13  used to scoff when i saw anons say my kind would always be newfags   now i know precisely how they felt when i look at the posts of anyone who came her from 13 onwards and wish i could go back to when i didnt have what is considered an above average knowledge of the sites history and now former culture    i miss not feeling like ive been here the longest in nearly every thread i see
  had to go somewhere    i became a regular on /b/ in 08 or 09 but know a couple of 20042007 people irl most oldfags basically grew out of imageboards and went to facebook and reddit
  yeah neverfuckingagain i might as well not be on social media if my best option is going back to plebbit/faceberg even if i stop being so edgy and abrasive those places still hold no appeal
  i feel like this is the uncomfortable truth a lot of my fellow oldfags 05 dont want to face    most of us grew up to be relative normalfags or at best moved to other websites theres no secret chan thats super busy and buzzing like the old days theres just former anons spending their time on a variety of forums social media platforms and content aggregation sites like reddit    what few niche imageboards still live are mostly linked to /jp/ stuff and are filled with neet weebs with depression or social anxiety who are mostly post08 themselves the other major english chans are a dying breed were the last one still rapidly growing to our detriment    the best ive found are a few legit oldfags on steam by searching certain phrases and fishing in mopey threads like this one no luck besides that though    the internet has changed its too deeply integrated into normal life closely monitored politicised and interconnected for a site like this to exist as it once did the concept of primarily sticking to just one discussion site is dead everyone is crosssite scum and the wild west vibe is never coming back     youre best off just sticking to niche boards on here and finding a couple forums and chat groups related to shit you care about if you crave the interaction maybe mix in twitter for following porn artists and a couple boorus if you must
  there really isnt anywhere left every single place on the internet has morphed itself to look more and more like the most popular sites on the internet because thats how you get new users   the few places that have remained static are places you probably dont want to browse in the first place why do you think 4chan got so popular to begin with     if you want to get really hipster you could register a usenet account and try that good luck conversing with the four people who have been doing that since the 80s and are probably unaware of anything that has happened since then
  yeah i can get that bear in mind that most of the superold oldfags i know left right around chanology thats 10 years ago with a completely different mode of interacting with the internet     facebook wasnt even facebook back then if you get me
    if youre really desperate you can dive deep into the /jp/ network of chat rooms small chans and blogspheres to find people who remember the old days so long as you can tolerate the incessant drama/moping/erp    scanlators are cancer though that scene was always volatilecand basically none of them have been at it for over five years or know here well since before then
  theres no secret chan thats super busy and buzzing like the old days    yeah i learned that lesson when i started looking for prechanology oldfags back in 2009 thinking there was some supersecret chan out there like how /i/ culture was hidden from normie 4chan users on places like 711 and all ended up learning about tor and found the old torchan but not some secret rebel base full of oldfags     oldfag el dorado has been a sort of ideal since right after chanology split the sites userbase into oldfags who were there before and newfags who came in to protest scientology     the best ive found are a few legit oldfags on steam by searching certain phrases and fishing in mopey threads like this one    all of the pre2008 oldfags i know i met irl and its shocking to see who they are since modern postows political 4chan would hate them     some guy who translates recordings for the nsa and was there for the original habbo raids  landwhale swj who was involved with the hal turner raids and is now into lesbian burlesque shows and prostituting herself to indian guys on tinder  a collection of fat lesbians who were oldfag ed editors in 2006 who are in the rocky horror theatre scene  an arrogant bisexual assembly programmer who really buys into fsf philosophy   a 2006 era ssbbw camwhore who was surprised i had stumbled onto her pics   a black anime nerd who was on the site in 2005     modern /pol/ influenced 4chan would hate these people so i think its ironic that this is who i know to be original to the site
  plebbit/faceberg  stop being such an edgy kid oldfags werent always edgy for the sake of it youre exactly the kind of zoomer that ruined 4chan with their stupid impression of an anon
  im not surprised honestly this place used to be way more centrist/liberal and started as an offshoot of sa that gradually drained in teens from a bunch of forums for shit like newgrounds and ebaums that kinda mix is going to mostly consist of nerds and outcasts    you see it most clearly imo whenever screencaps of threads from before 2009 get posted newfags always respond saying how glad they are words like epic and an unironic rofl are considered cringey nowadays they literally werent using the site when they were in vogue theyve only ever known them from trolls or seeing them on other websites its crazy to me to think im talking with people who think theyre above saying shit like that but have wojak folders hundreds of pics big
i dont actually remember when i started coming to 4chan my very very very very very first visit was probably in 2004 but i was not a regular user until 2010 with sporadic visits and posts in the years between i know up until around 2008 i didnt even consider 4chan as anything special it was just another chan and not one i was interested in i lurked 7chans /ss/ board
  im now realizing that it might just be because i havent ever paid attention but i cant remember the last time i saw anyone really do a raid ive seen people walk into /b/ thinking they could ask for one and get it and be refused immediately for obvious reasons but last time i heard of even a dox coming from here was either the start of gg or a finnish season of hwndu and the latter was practically a boardwide event    i have perfectly good reasons for not liking either site ones beyond theyll ban me is i say the nword
  modern /pol/ influenced 4chan would hate these people  have no sense of nuance and probably dont realise that they are tools for people with agendas and that 4chan has been bought
  i always feel like i missed out by never using other chans nowadays    obviously most were and are shit but sometimes i wonder what kind of image macros jokes comics happenings and other shit ive missed out on because i thought the rest sucked for being different at the time i dont think even the big alts have anything like ed where you can peruse some of their history and find out just a few articles here and there on it that have long since stopped getting updated which might be a blessing given its mostly used by newfag edgelords and has been for a long time    its why i started posting in small chans and diving in dead ones like tf2chan it makes me sad to think how much chan culture is going to be lost to time and i feel compelled to take more of it in while i still can
  its crazy to me to think im talking with people who think theyre above saying shit like that but have wojak folders hundreds of pics big  its cos 4chans main strength of no accounts and no permancy fucked itself in the ass anybody can say anything and with archives going back only so far and linkrot eating away other forgotten sites 4chan will forever be known as that altright site
at least i have an sa account until lowtax dies
  you dont get board wide raids anymore but i still see some smaller stuff happen every now and then a twitch stream chat ruined here a discord shit up there  anything involving account registration on a nonmajor site is rare though and that was really the only kind that was ever interesting to see    also dunno about true doxxing but just two months ago /v/ got capcom to pull a singer off one of their upcoming games by finding hed been accused of sending nudes to a minor and raising hell iver it because they hated his song to be clear not really true doxx but they did dig up personal info so eh
  ive seen some oldfags claim they have personal archives for some boards going back years before even sites like yukila have access to and another pair who maintain a timeline of big events on the site like all the gets and major memes and whatever media gets popular and the big dramas    id fucking kill to have access to them if they exist i want so badly for a more tangible and expansive archive of this place some proof it wasnt always a shit hole and once held actual value
  jason scott released that textonly archive if that interests you
how do we stop irony
  by making it mainstream and boring
how do we stop oldfag larping
  that clearly hasnt worked
  with their imitation of what they think an anon is  which is inconceivably stupid because an anon is just a person posting without a name      by being serious no matter what they say its like ruining a bad joke it kills all the fun for the people telling it
  hardcore /i/ culture got shutdown hardcore not long after the hbgary federal hacks 711 and other /i/ hosting sites had been dead a few years before that too
ive been here since 2008 and ill probably stay until its shutdown no matter how shitty 4chan gets theres really nowhere else on the internet quite like this place i dont know what ill do if this place goes but i know ill always remember the fun times ive had with every anon here
  u2
  ill always remember the fun times ive had with every anon here  so will i but ill also remember the injustice and garbage that myself and others had to endure
i was the /c/ poster in the last thread from world2ch who started posting late 2003/early 2004 i made a few posts in the thread that i think could be made more succinct so here goes    when most people talk about how 4chan needs to improve they reference the past  the good old days and often wonder what changed and how we can go back to it the reality is everything changes and the golden era is often shorter than you think the 60s summer of love the com boom 80s hair metal 90s grunge period the y2k era the early internet and the numerous other ones that may be more personal to yourselves all of these seminal moments in history are shortlived and never repeated 4chan is no different i was around in the golden days and while they were fun i dont think anyone realized they were temporary     when you chase the past you distract yourself into trying to make things right but you miss the authenticity of what made these periods so great in the first place 4chans golden era is done and over there may be another but it wont be anything like the last     i say this as a message not to the community but to the individual reading this post dont waste your life fruitlessly trying to relive days gone especially if you never lived them in the first place your golden era is out there but will most likely not be found on 4chan you have to accept this if you use 4chan for its purpose as an image/discussion board and remove yourself from the selfindulgence of the meta it will begin to change organically again maybe then youll unknowingly birth a new golden era like we did but ultimately it doesnt matter being a part of the early 4chan hasnt made much of an impact on me and while i enjoy reminiscing the future and the present matters so much more your life is bigger and more important than this website dont let yourself become invested in something you resent
  same here to be honest    4chan was never good newfag
  08 newfag here same as the first guy i quoted i feel like while the quality of the content is worse in my standard this is just a golden age within its own right to the current users its that eternal summer garbage where people come in and dont care about site and board culture    i feel like boards have lost their identity to a large degree back when i was a /b/tard or a /v/irgin i would feel as if i was in an actual community but now i guess theres either interests that are too similar between all boards or memes just spread too quickly to have board exclusive memes and culture in general every board i browse feels like the next one with the exception of s4s and thats something that bothers me and makes me feel out of touch needless to say thats not the only complaint i have but if i were to rant on about everything that was wrong id have to split the post up into several parts and i dont think anyone here cares to read     i barely ever post but i miss those rare times when i would post and it was the shit that id find unbearably cringy nowadays but back then it was funny in good spirit and people appreciated it i kind of hate myself for even trying to keep up with the times
ban all guns  ban pepe and wojack  permaban anyone who has cookies from reddit  have it so that anyone who enters 4chan via a hotlink be globaled for a month  require anyone who posts from a phone to have a 4chan pass in order to do so  there i saved 4chan and triggered every major cancerous group in the process
  ive been here since 2008 and ill probably stay until its shutdown  amen      i would feel as if i was in an actual community  i dont understand this sentiment outside of circle jerk generals on specific boards why does everyone try to make everything into a community now people collecting to discuss something or around a common interest doesnt automatically make it a community nor does it need to be one you dont have nor want bar communities cafe communities or club communities these simply dont need to exist and would benefit no one communities exist when theres a sense of common purpose and an advantage provided by cooperation they also require some concept of either leadership or direction which also implies rules and a power structure to answer my initial question of why does everyone try to make everything into a community now i believe its probably to create and ascend that power structure this also explains why all of these communities end up refocusing their time and resources on maintaining the community itself rather than the task / topic they were originally established for like charities that spend most of their money on more fundraising eg oss projects like the nodejs code of conduct fiasco or the llvm code of conduct fiasco or the brendan eich mozilla fiasco    outside of specific general threads this isnt a community and i hope it never becomes one
  irony is literally the lol so random of the 2010s just a more cynical variant i think the lolrandom attitude died down because everyone started to absolutely detest it holds up spork etc and because the new contextless style of humor was being ironic simply because it signals selfawareness there is zero difference between a holds up spork of doooooom o_o fag and a despacito is stored in the balls fag other than the degree of cynicism i really cant believe how much of this is tolerated any time some zoomer joins a community they will shit it up with their faggot deep fried contextless pictures because they have absolutely nothing to add every discord server nowadays has a section for shitposts and memes both of these words have lost their meaning and become synonymous with each other to quarantine this cancer better to just ban them
  casuals who dont care much about the topic and will shitpost at the expense of the topic and will even directly shitpost the topic for attention its easy to see the asshole shitposting princess peach with softcore porn from the op even easier when someone posts 2bs ass as if those things arent an obvious attention whoring attempt at the direct expense of intelligent discussion of those topics they dont care about any quality of discussion the userbase is as bad as they are allowed to be this is why the sfw/nsfw split wont work unless moderation changes
  i dont mind irony so much of all the memes ive seen come and go its one of the least awful if it was any good itd probably require effort and then it wouldnt be an ultrapopular meme that everyone partakes in after all  i have never and probably will never get deepfrying intentionally making it harder for people to look at what youre saying isnt a joke ive seen good memes get directly lessened by randomly warping the image and covering it with artifacts and emojis
  i thought deep frying was funny for like a week because it was bizarre it really feels like everything has followed suit in trying to be bizarre and strange to the point where it is entertaining the problem here though is that as this kind of thing becomes popular it raises the bar on what is bizarre to absurd degrees  the fact that nothing really requires effort anymore i think is a side effect of modern day user contentcentric websites being structured in certain ways there is always some kind of attention or status score system upvotes views real money etc it doesnt usually buy you anything but it makes you feel a bit better about yourself and theyre probably implemented for that reason so that people can come back and make the owners more ad revenue because of how much site score has become a central part of many sites people tend to make memes with low effort because even if you put a lot of effort into them it might not be that popular and make you as much score as you intended this is also a side effect how how bloated website userbases are now due to the increased consolidation of the rest of the internet features like infinite scrolling encourage just taking in microdoses of entertainment until you get bored and i think such things play a good part in this as well this has all gone to the point where people on this site which really have no sensible score other than post count have begun to consider yous a relatively new feature as score  older sites where usergenerated content were central also tended to have a score system but it worked the way it should more often than not because higher quality content was usually more rewarded whereas now you just gotta take a screenshot of some twitter post about being shocked over not finding ones belongings
  thank you for articulating this holy shit
  theres far too much and it reduces everything to a total muddle
  i get your aversion to communities and i guess i misspoke i didnt mean it in that organized sense of community what i meant was i used to get a better sense of board identity
  community  but there was a sense of community in the sense of people gathering around for the love of their hobby      how old are you its not really productive to le wrong generation and reminisce about something you werent part of especially when all thats left is warped memes
  people gathering around for the love of their hobby  this is where it all falls apart too many people who just dont care are going to boards and messing everything up mods dont care either /v/ has constant fetish threads and they dont delete them and ban people for shitting on the topic
  everything can be made with loweffort these days     all these fucking soundcloud rappers with laziest lyrics and the simplest beats becoming huge as if everybody is taking inspiration from soulja boy
  every generation has their unfunny memes deepfrying wasnt the first and it wont be the last if you would read my post a second time youd find that all this irony business isnt that bad as far as memes that spread over the whole internet go    i actually know a soundcloud rapper irl he goes by lil bungie cord which is why i can only be so mad at this generation
  what the fuck is it with these shitty screencaps are you trying to prove that in tyool 2018 4chan is even remotely as funny or interesting as it use to be    i dont think you can truly get what 4chan was before if /pol/ post2014 is your entry point its like that wave speech in fear and loathing in las vegas
  i mentioned earlier i screencapped these because i liked them and wanted to find the joke again later since this thread is mostly just people remembering the good old days im partaking in it and sharing my personal favorite experiences  youre probably right that this website will never be how it used to be again but its not all bad now only mostly bad
  but thats because /v/ has a specific board culture and fetish threads could arguably be fit into that this was a huge point of contention at a point in time and moot agreed that board culture was acceptable and board related im not saying i like or agree with them but its the same with the 4 am generals or the piccolodick threads
  its funny to think about how drastically different the responses to that post would be 15 years ago even 10     epic win  lol  rofl  underageb    etc
  specific board culture  the culture should be about video games including respecting them on a basic level why do you think the board is so garbage in the first place
  /v/ has constant fetish threads and they dont delete them and ban people for shitting on the topic    including respecting them on a basic level  lol are you saying jerking off to something is blatant disrespect to an entire medium do you think people started to jerk of to anime and video games on 4chan recently prudes never had a place on 4chan other than being laughed at and trolled
  did you understand what he even said or did you just want to prove that posting softcore porn everywhere is the same as not being a prude    its one thing to have the occasional i like soandsos thing thread but when they take up multiple threads in the catalog its pretty annoying especially when we have dedicated porn boards
  i think its worse just than superirony its just people being so fucking unoriginal that while copying other peoples works that theyve also lifted the surface attitudes of the works without understanding or caring why its there in the first place
i guess this is aimed at older anons late 20s or older but ive been wondering for the longest time why each batch of newfags since 2012 have become more hostile more bitter more repetitive more delusional somehow they have both grandiose and negative views of themselves more humourless with each passing year and ive come to the conclusion that classic underdog outcast nerd is dead with geek among most other subcultures merging with the mainstream and this being the safe space nobully generation almost everyone is catered for so to be an outcast gen z teenager now youd have to be a completely unlikeable humourless arsehole  s pretty much two approaches when it comes to discussion now youre either a super serious sperg or youre a brain dead idiot regugitating posts already made a thousand times before that arent even insightful or relevant the former are the newfags on /pol/ who will make replies saying theyre going to get the rope for slightly disagreeing with them and the latter are those who use yikesbasedcringe ect as they cant be bothered to put any effort into expressing what they think while hiding behind irony  this is /pol/ in a nutshell everyone take the most innocuous posts so personally god forbid someone mentions that theyre having some trouble in life in front of these viscous kids
  disrespecting the mods reported
  pol boogieman posting reported
    apparently they lifted the restriction on announcing reports i wish id found out in a far less obnoxious way
  that report method is still in /v/
moot moved on why havent you
  i have nowhere else to go and this is one of the few sources of social interaction i feel comfortable with  anonymous is my closest friend
  because i have very specific needs that only anonymity can provide the rules are also good here unlike any other anonymous imageboard
  your report was in vain nice try
  being this new
  who hurt you
  moot is cute
  i am moving on this is gonna be my last year here 2018 and 2017 have been the driest fucking years on 4chan with absolutely nothing interesting happening in them and the userbase getting even worse hopefully jmoots stupid plan backfires and kills 4chan and the tether that keeps me here
could this site ever be saved if someone bought this site could they ever wrangle it back into shape
  yes of course but it requires team dedication all from the admin the mod team the developers and the janitors a very effective cleanup can happen and respect each boards respective cultures but that requires way too much effort than anybody on the current team wants to give    so in theory yes but in all practicality never
  could this site ever be saved  no    all these people who say it can be fixed are either deluded or newfags 4chan sa fark ytmnd etc come from a specific point in the internets era a specific point in geek entertainment a specific point in gaming etc    theres no going back
  accounts and moderation that understands and respects the topics and understands the difference between right and wrong and why something is right or wrong
  it would require so much effort so many purges so many moderators and janitors that it would probably never happen
so lets say 4chan shuts down and a new chan arises in its place  posting wojak or pepe gets you banned on sight   all of the nerd culture boards like /a/ /v/ /vp/ /c/ and /co/ are back but no more /pol/ /r9k/ /b/ /int/ /sp/ etc  tight moderation   posting politics and twitter screencaps are bannable offenses   words like based redpilled and cringe are filtered to epic upvoted toxic and so on   no ads  would you browse it
  no not really i dont want tight moderation i want communicative moderation
  you can have both
  tight moderation  thats not very descriptive and i wouldnt know what to expect for all i know moderation under that description could decide to ban people for posting something a little bit offtopic that isnt disruptive and i dont know what the rules are
  as long as it had a /tg/ that was composed of more than 40kiddies then yeah i dont actually mind politics it just needs an effective containment board that isnt radical in any direction
  yes absolutely youd never get back to the old days because that period is gone for good but you could absolutely make the site a decent imageboard again itd just require someone with balls of steel a willingness to drive off the majority of users from the last few years and a much bigger mod team  meaning itll probably never happen    but hypothetically i think this could make the site decent within six months to a year  delete /r9k/ /soc/ /bant/ /trash/ /vg/ /mlp/ /adv/ /pol/ /news/ /x/ /vip/ /qa/ /s4s/ /biz/ and /b/  completely kills every worthless board which has become a major entry point for the newfags whove flooded into here since 2012 absolutely destroys the main hubs they like to hang out in as well only ones spared are ones focused on major hobbies/forms of media keep ponies banned also  create /jlit/ /cpsht/ and /v2k/  first is for light and visual novels both can still be discussed on other boards in relation to adaptations of them that are relevant eg index threads on /a/ but are otherwise contained only exception is /jp/ since theyre essential to the board  second is for all marvel and dc superhero films tv shows cartoons and other liveaction or animated works other forms of media from them are allowed on relevant boards  third is /vr/ but for the sixth generation of consoles because discussion of them grows less possible each year on /v/ but /vr/ would be ruined by including them  bring back text boards for all major media boards /a/ /v/ /tv/ etc and ban generals on them also  generals breed insular cultures which fracture the boards and stifle discussion of new and old topics in favour of longstanding ones shuffle them off to text boards to kill the waifu imagespam problem and make them less attractive for newfags  obviously this needs strict enforcement on what constitutes a general     part 1
  now for some major rule changes  ban all pepe and wojak variants and their posters on site permanently   implement a new system where posting images of with a certain hash makes your posts ghosted so nobody else sees them for a certain time apply this to common shitposting pictures and never tell people when they trigger this system  bring back bans preventing you from viewing the boards youre banned from for their duration apply it to all of them  do more public bans  rangeban all mobile ips permanently remove the posting buttons on the mobile site make the site remove them on the desktop version if youre viewing it via a mobile browser and break compatibility with mobile apps if possible salt the earth and kill this as much as possible mobile posting makes ban evasion far too easy  give pdf posting to more boards such as /lit/ expand the filesize limit on /gif/ and implement other quality of life changes  increase the character count by at least 50 on all boards to encourage longform discussion  introduce thread specific ids for all boards to make falseflagging and shitposting harder  make the irc the primary official channel of communication from users to the site staff and have it manned much more actively than now instead of using this trash board as a pseudocontainment for complaints so you dont have to deal with them on other boards    then just be proactive about banning shitposters in the wake of this  because it will be fucking unspeakably bad at first  and when the newfags inevitably make their own chan to try recreate this place as its been since 2014 and switch to advertising it here clamp down on it too i guarantee this shithole would be a thousand times more tolerable by years end if you did this and that most of the major boards would see huge improvements spoilerand then you can safely bring back /x/ and hopefully have it not devolve into larping and /pol/tier conspiracy theories again/spoiler
  first is for light and visual novels  light and visual novels barely manage to fill like seven fucking threads across the entirety of 4chan
  anon go look at /a/ really look closely there are fucking tons of threads about light and visual novels consistently because of how many shows are adaptations of them now     threads for series like index goblin slayer fate the sciadv series and many others are only nominally about the anime and manga when a new episode airs  but the ln and vns are what sustain the discussions after or between relevant adaptations of them getting released nearly every general and pseudogeneral on the board is based off of one and theres tons of generals on /vg/ and consistent threads on /v/ about vns or ln related series as well    the only way to avoid killing discussion of the two mediums on every image board but /jp/ under the new text board rules i proposed is to give them a seperate board so theyre not caught in the generals ban even if its slow compared to /a/ and /vg/ now thats not a bad thing     youd still be able to discuss events from later in the source material on /a/ if youre talking about yet another ln adaptation youd just not be able to run effective generals about them or start off threads specifically for them
the biggest problem this site has is that the kids who used to lurk /b/ when /b/ was at peak popularity grew up into the bitter adults who post on /pol/ now  while their stupid mentality that 4chan is some sort of secret club that is always right persisted        4chan was never for censorship you can visit reddit if you want that
  yeah those are anime threads you can tell because if there was no anime very few people would be discussing them you mention index and fate like theyre typical examples from a pool of 50 ln/vn franchises that people are raring at the bit to discuss but theyre not theyre literally the most successful examples of the lot clear out index kawakami typemoon 07th and light and theres really not much below it    a vn/ln board would have maybe 1015 threads up at any given time for the seasonal adaptations of the current / last season and then maybe another ten threads for the existing general threads and then after that be a glacially slow board of offseason light novels where people just dump images of megumin or whatever
i dont really have a big problem with the state of the site to be honest ive been posting several years and still find it good for hobbies and porn
  4chan was never for censorship you can visit reddit if you want that  nothing that i posted is censorship unless you consider the current existing standards of banning shitposting using rangebans the cripplechan filter deleting offtopic threads etc to be censorship as well    in which case youre retarded
  gonna have to disagree with you same way quest threads exploded when /qst/ was made i think a dedicated board for lns and vns would both encourage more discussion of them and be fine running at a slower pace theres plenty of interest in bith to sustain a smaller board    even if a few series dominated it that isnt an issue so long as theyre made to wait for threads to drop into the archives before making new ones
  i would keep a meta board and one random board but they would have rules and would be moderated
  delete a bunch of boards  youve cured the symptoms and not the virus trash and vg are home to a huge number of write/drawfags that make shit for other boards and things like /agdg/ are also hubs of creation if you were to delete /vg/ then where do the fighting game players go theres no way they could merge into 1 general because they would hit bump within hours and they cant coexist in 1 thread without flame wars either this extends to every set of generals that share a genre you cant merge /v/ into /vg/ either because theres only so much space in the catalog and it would be way too fast most of those other boards are the same and only suck due to newfags deleting the boards doesnt delete the newfags any why not delete /tv/ if you ignore above since its 90 frogs  ban ponies   this benefits noone i would wager mlp has more oldfags than most boards too  /jlit/  why not just give jp more pages in the catalog and keep jlit in there  capes  extend the catalog on co and tv and this solves itself if that wouldnt work then sure go for it  v2k   this is just an issue of v being shit  text boards  generals like /agdg/ /fgg/ or /dfg/ require images to discuss their topic and need the general format for pastebins and op info youve killed the waifufags but now a whole bunch of good shit dies boards like /tg/ also might not survive having part of the userbase being siphoned off into a textboard it could completely split /tg/ amongst a few of the potential fracture lines it already has and then the whole thing dies    1/x
  ban all pepe and wojak  only good rule so far this would be far more effective in killing newfags than any other rule you posted  posting images of with a certain hash makes your posts ghosted   its really easy to change an image hash but i suppose it may help slow down retards  bring back bans preventing you from viewing the boards youre banned from for their duration  what is this supposed to do when youre banned youre supposed to use that time to lurk more this prevents lurking and may make people more likely to rage/act like a n00b when they get back which just starts a death spiral  do more public bans  yes  rangeban all mobile ips permanently  this might fuck /out/ or /fa/ its also a shit rule if being banned makes it so you cant see boards as phoneposters should be forced to lurk rather than be locked out completely   pdf posting to more boards such as /lit/ expand the filesize limit on /gif/  sure  increase the character count by at least 50 on all boards   yes   make the irc the primary official channel of communication from users to the site staff and have it manned much more actively than now  agreed
you can make as many changes as you like but if the population pool of classic underdog outcast nerds/geeks/social rejects which 4chan and other older sites draw from is basically dead what exactly is the point     4chans final legacy is going to be neonazi larpers with milewide streak of trapfaggotry i want to say i find it bizarre that faggotry and trapfaggotry is doing so here but thinking about it a little bit and you kinda realize that its the only place something like it would spawn from
  tfw im the cancer that killed /b/
people here that browsed the site for 15 years actually care about it  huh
  my thoughts exactly the bar of what constitutes a social reject has been raised so high that only being an incel nazi tranny etc funny how those three intersect so much can truly make you feel like an outcast at this point being a normalfag on this site or anywhere on the internet is unsurprisingly the coolest you can be at this point just look at how much chad is thrown around
originalfag here     anyone remember when /n/ got deleted for being /pol/ back then  moot knew it was a shit board and didnt care that it brought in traffic     delete / pol/ everyone there is from reddit anyway
  poor bait
honestly would removing /pol/ be the answer its a shining beacon for fashy assholes who think that 4chan is that cool place where they can say nigger a lot
    its so late at this point that it doesnt matter /pol/ is literally the last thing thats unfortunately keeping the place alive
  i think removing it would make things worse just give it the /mlp/ treatment and make it an actual containment board
  i think it has to do with millennials generally being more accepting of nerds/geeks/weebs/social rejects than past generations
  almost literally what the op said
  it has to do with corporations making geek culture look cool and the norm so they can sell stuff
  social rejects need to be culled to a more reasonable level than theyre at now its completely insane how backwards some people are its at the point where it just destroys entire threads and even boards when a happening of that sort happens its a bad example when it gets into some things or when it gets too big and outlandish
you know whats annoying this was the only place i could voice somewhat emphasis on somewhat unpc opinions that i want to discuss and have a somewhat constructive discussion on certain boards now that everything is so extreme i cant voice that opinion cos some /pol/tard will come out the woodworks to amplify that opinion and it doesnt become a discussion
  now you get  based  this but unironically   cringe  based and redpilled
  this but unironically
  muh pol
  the only problem with /pol/ is the amount of publicity newfags and redditors it brings ive always pushed for  deleting /pol/  /pol/ is instead moved to /b/  aforementioned fags wouldnt keep up with general /b/ shit  they leave 4chan for good  thing is it doesnt take care of other problems mentioned earlier in this thread i personally detest any normalfag who sees this place as a site to be le ironic it doesnt take care of the occasional flood of newfags when a meme pops up from here the community itself is in shambles due to the current demographics of 4chan etc etc
as an anon in his early 20s let me tell you a different story op the matter at hand expresses itself in the conception of what you think makes someone a social outcast bear with me there are two reasons that someone could be considered a social outcast    in 2008 or 1998 or even earlier especially in america you could be an original anon social outcast weeb nerd just as op described however that has only to do with taste and perhaps style and these two things was what set you apart from others at school but the character didnt matter you could be a lonely nerd weeb outcast or have a charismatic character and have a band of nerd friends this didnt change your status in regard of the general population there are always these bands of outcasts at school this is one type of social outcast but the thing that you ignore is that it works the other way too that character or your lack thereof may permeate so strongly throughout your style that even though your tastes do not set you apart from the bunch anymore in 2018 anime is the new cool thing vidya has been for so long you are still an outcast because the issue lays within yourself that means essentielly you are disliked for who you are inside  your lack of charisma your lack of ability to connect or simply your ugliness stemming from a bodily defect which in turns of course affects your character  and not from the second layer of your personality
a bit unrelated but ever notice the staggering amount of tripfags and really forumfags we have here its fucking insane theres so many of them just circlejerking on boards like /vg/ /b/ /soc/ and all the other boards that have dedicated generals posts like oh so today i finally did that thing i was telling you guys about should be bannable  4chan isnt your fucking personal blog yet every newfag is using it like it is to escape reality were getting to a point where places like /vg/ are no better than neogaf /r9k/ is no better than facebook and /a/ is no better than gaia  op is correct and no one knows what to do about it
  you are disliked for who you are inside  your lack of charisma your lack of ability to connect or simply your ugliness stemming from a bodily defect which in turns of course affects your character  and not from the second layer of your personality  thats a very good post especially this part whether a person is likable or unlikable comes from the inside and what they do or like is only a show of their internal character but its also good to remember that people can change

  what a fucking cringe image kill yourself polweenie incel autist
  is this the sweetie girl
  based
nostalgiafags constantly whining is so tiresome if you are so great at posting then make some good oc
  post oc  i see newfags dont understand that memes werent created for the intention of being memes
  this  i blame social media
  this people after about 2010/11 really didnt get the point of 4chan
  no slashes
  boxxy  oh boy
  it has done nothing in the last few years but cement itself as the arse of the internet
  not often you hear forced meme nowadays
  /vp/ has doxed its fair share of dumb children through their friend codes
        at this point i genuinely think it would help yes the current /pol/ kids would go ballistic and shit up the rest of 4chan with frogs and garbage for at least a couple months but you would permanently be rid of the biggest and most cancerous newfag magnet on the site the big problem with /pol/ isnt the kind of cancer that post there but the kind of cancer that continues to come to 4chan because of /pol/
  jesus i still have my bozxy folder somewhere
  lets just say you remove /pol/ then what happens cos its been stated several times that the people who initially made 4chan great do not exist anymore i mean we have  idiots thinking that 4chan was about making oc content    im not saying that /pol/ is worth keeping im saying let it all come crashing down the internet is a garbage fire these days anyway
  fashy
  lets just admit that fascism should be either spelled or pronounced differently as it stands it resembles other english words more than english grammar would indicate  seriously though unironically using the word fashy should be punishable by jail time
  i think fascism is a loan word though ironically a thousand years ago sc  sh
  what would happen is that the constant stream of new redditors flocking to 4chan because of /pol/ would lessen  would that save 4chan and send it back to its golden age no would it reduce the rate at which 4chan keeps growing shittier yes
    fascism fæʃjzəm  fascismo faʃʃizmo  fascio faʃʃo  fasces faskeːs
  would it reduce the rate at which 4chan keeps growing shittier yes  wouldnt a crash and burn be more entertaining 4chan is heading for the end
  why did moot never just add a donate feature but instead did 4chan passes surely he saw that most people would see it as 4chan gold right main reason i dont own one actually
  oh no no no no look at this dude he made the thread again  how can you be seething this hard  dabs on u
  dumb frogposter
  seething
  why did you reply its such obvious bait
  dumb frogposter
oldfags didnt outgrow 4chan they just got assimilated by the normalfags
  demographic replacement is oldfag genocide
  isnt that what ops quote basically says unless im missing something
  the rules are also good here unlike any other anonymous imageboard  did you mean to say more tolerable than elsevwhere      i am moving on this is gonna be my last year here  how many times have you said this over the years
   a new system where posting images of with a certain hash makes your posts ghosted so nobody else sees them for a certain time apply this to common shitposting pictures and never tell people when they trigger this system   the character count by at least 50 on all boards to encourage longform discussion   thread specific ids for all boards to make falseflagging and shitposting harder  youre describing an average 20002010 era forum only without user accounts its not going to work precisely due to lack of registration
  assimilated  its called mimicry youngster
  how many times have you said this over the years  honestly only this and last year i mean despite 2016 basically sealing 4chans fate it was a fun year almost like a revival    sorta how being in a burning building is more fun than walking through the burnt out wreck left behind
  then hopefully youll stay away and find peace finally or find a better ib even if its much smaller and slower
  then hopefully youll stay away and find peace finally  me too ill hang around until the end of the year and come back for when jmoot finally runs this place into the ground which i dont think is too long now      or find a better ib even if its much smaller and slower  i think those days are long gone its time now i pick up the piece of my life and try and make something out of them
  raids needing an account fell out of favor with email verification getting better sock puppeting a dozen different gmails to get in on short notice is a pain in the ass
  postironicism is the future
  whats sammy up to these days
  lurking probably trying to stabilize his bitcoin gains  maybe working on another hydewars as far as i know hes awol
  i believe the rules here try to mean the best but really the issues usually come from the enforcement of them or lack thereof
  postirony is merely a synonym for ironic humor turned up to 11 nothing more to say about that
  post irony is like irony applied to irony at which point it basically becomes idempotent and any further irony just stays at the same level
  i thought he was suspected of sending mail bombs to lead democrat party members
  cancer reporting in    came in with the pony craze    i made a torrent of a fuck ton of pony pictures art image reactions gifs ect in 2012    i like to think i helped in a small way the spreading reason is i mentioned my torrent to a mod in irc once and he said i know
  i thought 4chan died in 2014
  the entire internet is so awash in this selfaware derivative nonsense its just not fun anymore theres hardly any sincerity anymore and where there is theres this looming certainty of drama or ridicule even for even the smallest thing  my theory is that a big reason for why this cynical distanced irony became so popular in the recent years is due to a proportional rise in documented edrama and lolcows with irony acting as a sorta shield to hide behind to prevent any kind of potential harm to the person hell it even works both ways if the person using irony can just convince themself that it wasnt really me in the first place  perhaps irony is just a way to cope with the deanonymization and balkaniztion of the internet that people can now be found and held easily accountable for their own words even out of context     its so fucking irritating i just wanna have fun and have chill conversations not have to deal with epic funni metareferential meme after metareferential meme perhaps the the contrarian solution to this is and god help me that dumb niceposting the bumstead kind not the cancerous erp avatarfagging variety its as good a counter i can think of at the moment
  fuck off brony
  i think so i am diametrically opposed to what /pol/ typically says but i will absolutely defend their right to say it the problem is that its just not staying in /pol/ anymore the problem is a combination of divided political culture irl and the fact that /pol/ is an echo chamber full of people desperate to argue so they naturally go to other boards and try to extrapolate political discourse out of any board material ie the ubiquitous thinly veiled /pol/ thread    weve had /pol/ for years and never had this issue the problem is really down to the fact that theyre bored and they need people to argue and debate with to the extent where its ruining other boards i think theyre just trying to spread their ideology or something its not about persecuting them for their political beliefs its just the fact that its just basically trolling now and everyone is getting sick of it    the only solution i can see is either stronger moderation on /pol/posting outside of /pol/ or removing the board altogether i dont want to do the latter but given how much shit is being generated from it in terms of reallife political drama bandwidth usage and its users spamming the rest of the board with political shit im running out of options     ive been here long enough to wait most stupid memes and fads out but its just getting to the point where its impossible to post if nothing else at least create a bigger divide between 4chan and 4channel so it can exist away from us
  its not just the internet either
  a lot of people dont want to be responsible for anything the extreme use of irony is them thinking they found a get out of jail free card for anything they do
theres a great post titled bronies and the new sincerity that touches on it    irony fags show up about once a decade and think they thought of it themselves    theyre always dicks
  its been 4 years when do we get sincerity again
  here it is     my favourite remark is that they arent sure if theyre in on their own joke
  this image is dumb because suiseiseki wasnt even a meme on old /b/
  i will absolutely defend their right to say it  but i want to enact rules against them saying it  congrats man youre a dumbfuck leftist who will eternally be at odds with the vast majority of this websites userbase both old and new nice job using this place for years while failing to grasp the most basic pieces of our culture go kill yourself faggot
  our culture  lamo 4chan was never about unfettered free speech lest every single board would just be no different from /b/  and yea hes an idiot to think deleting /pol/ would even fix the greater problem which isnt just /pol/shit 4chan has gone back to being deeply balkanized between boards the staff are their most impotent in years the site is owned by a moneylaundering jap who doesnt know what the fuck hes doing and treats 4chan like an investment while he sells books and livestreams to his autistic nip audience and worst of all theres no real drive by anyone to do anything a year ago i wouldve said /bant/ would be an example to follow spiritwise but even theyve now fallen into the same cynical malaise as the rest of the site
  theres a difference between having the right to express an opinion and creating threads just to shove it down peoples throats knowing full well that the intention is to just argue with people    no offense but i can tell from your post that you dont predate me so im not really interested in what you think the site culture is
  twitter screencap threads are the best indicator tbdesu
  4chan has gone back to being deeply balkanized between boards the staff are their most impotent in years the site is owned by a moneylaundering jap who doesnt know what the fuck hes doing and treats 4chan like an investment while he sells books and livestreams to his autistic nip audience   why am i still here why havent i left yet    theres no real drive by anyone to do anything  oh yeah thats it
remember how gay s4s was
  you mean in a good way
  yes i meant it was gay ironically
  thats impossible
  yep thats the low hanging fruit and you can spot the other ones a mile off anyway i think they think theyre being slick by taking for example an event in videogaming and then phrasing the post in a way that opens a discussion that will invariably centre around something political
i like to think the quality of wins dropped so dramatically because anon decided attention is more important than lulz a good chunk of what everybody remembers was done in the name of lulz
  that is essentially why people blame social media such as facebook and reddit because those platforms are immensely popular and the whole thing is about stroking your ego instead of just making everyone laugh and that whole mindset somehow found its way into 4chan and kind of shit all over everything  theres no reason that /soc/ should have ever existed but it does because people are people
  literally nothing
  like gay as in joyful
   will absolutely defend their right to say it   not in my backyard  nothing hypocritical here
  leftist  shut up newfag
  i dont see how the nuance is so difficult to grasp here
  poltards arent great on nuance
  oh  true
  welcome brony
  m4sterchan  fug totally forgot about that one is it still up ending up being more pedo than 8ch /pedo/ funnily enough
  fuck this post resonates particularly    a year ago i wouldve said /bant/ would be an example to follow spiritwise but even theyve now fallen into the same cynical malaise as the rest of the site    i felt the exact same way when /bant/ was first established it was a serious throwback in the feeling of old 4chan with the lax and carefree attitude with the flavor of silliness that didnt take itself so seriously and everybody was just bantering with each other in good humor    but then it got stale and i left to go to another board which then still had some spirit but which too has now fallen into the cynical malaise you speak of worse than ever among the boards i browse regularly which is not a lot these days /tv/ is probably the greatest example of this but its done such a good job at coating and covering it up with sheer retardedness that its actually fun even though it came at the cost of the board itself    /tv/ is basically /tv/  television  film/random now
there is no other place  what about /qa/ and  and 
does it count as irony that these threads came alongside the awful users that alternative successfully moved to worsen /qa/ so much or is it just pure naivety
  i agree completely its a bit sad that loads of icebreakers start with did you see x on y
  on the other hand i suck cocks
2469982  people responding to bait
  himasugi  shitposting circlejerkers also owned by reiko    onesixtwo  literally no topic what so ever just endless shitposting    your retarded sites are worse than this site in 2018
the site wouldnt be so bad if the containment boards worked at least its easy to spot the retards by pepeposting and wojack/npc posting
is it just me or has the troll mindset effectively become mainstream most people on the internet including even sjws take some form of joy out of other peoples contempt towards them nowadays it seems like everyone wants to be andy kaufman nowadays
  tfw 07  it was fun while it lasted
  i think a good amount of it is spite the web is more selfsegregated than before despite the limitless freedom of it and within each of these groups is a preferred boogeyman who is to be blamed as the scapegoat to why perceived ills within and without the community exist its always their fault and so when something bad happens to them by the group or from another source a selfsatisfying feeling comes up and that event is exploited hence the faux ultrasmug reactions thats so tiring and prevalent today under the guise of irony and cynicism     everybody wants to blame the other person so that they dont have to blame themselves of course there are certainly times where other outside forces are in fact to blame but it is not this way 100 of the time thats where the seeming confusion is coming from
rremove /pol/  ban all shitposters  turn focus towards serious discussion  heavier moderation  its hilarious how you retards dont realize that policies like these are what began the degradation of 4chan in the first place  no one comes here for that except humourless autists and reddit crossposters this place has always been and always will be for shitposting and fucking around with the occasional productive discussion regardless of board  further implementation of these things will not alleviate the issues this place faces but rather speed up the process of its downfall
  at this point 4chan is so balkanized that i wonder what still keeps the site together every side wants to have their own private 4chan by enacting a set of rules to their liking on this point i should congratulate the staff for not doing any of that being it keeps the status quo but eventually i think that action in one way or another is unavoidable and people will end up leaving hopefully    i browse several different boards and some that arent /pol/ would be completely at odds with the delusions of some anons posting itt its not even like thes ethreads are engaged in active warfare against said anons they dont have the same mindset hell they probably dont even browse here    posts that say ban all frog/wojakposters or ban all shitposters are simply deluded and have no idea of where the site stands at the moment thats what staying segregated in /qa/ does to you and thats just an example even though i fully well know that if i am to get any yous they will call me out as a frog/wojakposter or worse as an easy way to discard my argument
  this is why the sfw/nsfw split wont work unless moderation changes  the split isnt an attempt to improve the site for its users but for advertisers
  removing /pol/ will get rid of a lot of reddit crossposters though
  ive been a humorless autist for over ten years so the new 4channel will probably suit me just fine
old 4chan for me meant jb occasional cheese pizza and that dated phrase for the lulz basically what i came to /b/ for during those golden years and of course that sense of camaraderie and community      /tv/  after consuming a lifetimes worth of jailbait pics /tv/s been more or less a home board since 2012 makes me immune to cunnyposting
  fuckingthis
came to 4chan in 2011 i wish i could have been a part of the ride earlier shit i remember when we said we would be here forever    the culture of the internet is changing anons are a certain breed of people youll be able to see the wandering the wasteland of the normienet like the antisocial spergish vagabonds they are     nunewfags 2015 just dont get the culture that made the forums here such a great place by that point the culture was already perverted beyond recognition they think that anons are nyhlist assholes who hate everyone and want everything to burn like incels or some shitty rick and morty arc     yeah we did shitty stuff yeah we had larpeqsue insane ideologies they just dont get it hell i cant explain it its not for the lulz anymore its not a bunch of misfits hanging out like the teenage years alot of us didnt have we took solace in our fellow anons we had our own thing now the community just feels like reddit everyone trying to impress one another everyone acting so fake no community    i keep saying i wont ive tried leaving many times but fuck ive been on this damned site for 8 years ill watch it burn we cant fix it i just know something else will come up later this shits cyclical so ill go down with the ship one last time for the lulz    inb4 projecting
  nunewfags 2015  2012 mr cancerfag i dont know what it was but the final change was perceptible in 2013 before the fappening gamergate and r/the_donald
  maybe if you repeat this long enough itll become true
  same difference to me i dont go around posting politics and talking about my penis like its the deciding factor in my life advertisers just want a website without the retard flavor of politics and porn
  i lurked sa a lot in the early 2000s this is my post and i remember going mainly on /h/ in 2005 because /b/ was a scary place then i stayed there more and more until eventually probably in january 2006 i was part of the game / epic win generation and actively sought that content there    at that time oldfag memes like yaranaika in threads only oldfags can understand were funny but exactly that  i never understood the context of them or what they were about its funny but i never got it because i never cared to and no old fag would bother explaining it its taken twelve years and these two posts to get an idea of the context          thats only two years removed what chance does anybody now browsing have to follow the culture the active users now define the culture for better or worse  i think the only real time the nuboard culture has made me irate was the npc meme this year because it was so unfunny and low effort and destined to die out quick  but its enthusiasts were saying it would have staying power and would literally change the world    you can still find some of the older mentality here you could fuck with people on /biz/ see all the 1 posts by this id posts and 9 times out of 10 theyll never get it and its kind of fun but a place like /tv/ will have more of that oldfag mentality
the only way we could have some semblance of a new kind of the old days back is if 3 important things happened    a relaxation of the rules especially regarding invasions  mods that publicly ban and sticky music and be irritating cunts again  more tripfags    all of these sound awful but theyre literally what made people here active cunts who did things fixing the three above made this place sanitized and dead
  critical mass probably  also when was kym made
  it came after tvtropes right
  more tripfags  what good would it do today      fuck if i know ive only read cancertropes once and that was because people were discussing fermented fish and such otherwise whenever its brought up i know its time to close a tab
  thats what staying segregated in /qa/ does to you  i think this is actually one of the biggest problems to the discussion of the current status of 4chan  the whole site is now so large that you can easily spend days on some of the minor boards like /his/ or /lit/ without spending single minute on the big ones like /v/ /mu/ or /tv/
i named my roblox character nate_higgers
yeah im thinking this is based
why the fuck is this stickied

  how does t make you a newfag    regards ylilauta pro
  /pol/
this is the board for discussing other boards and asking questions about 4chan in general this also includes meta threads from other boards that mods move here  asides from that there are several groups of people which have gathered here each of which interpret the  other things in the sticky different it was rumored as the secret mod hangout for some time although staff has repeatedly confirmed theyre not actively reading this board  overall /qa/ lines up with /vip/ and some nws boards /b/ /bant/ /r9k/ s4s /trash/ which dont have a specific topic and where only some or all global rules apply some regular posters on this board come from those
  the t meme has nothing to do with /pol/
/qa/ is where the war for 4chans soul is being waged
  ill trust the man who posts with the 8s by 3
if you like frogs and meta then youve come to the right place
  /qa/ does not check numbers
  what are you talking about i didnt check anything     hes the 8th post in the thread and hes 3 times as right
  nws  you need to stop right now the term is nsfw and always will be
  no keep going
rwds
  real whacky dick spunkies
  rearwheel drive system
  t started in around 2014 newfag
  this pic has me slightly aroused
  /qa/ has a specific topic meta you just refuse to acknowledge that fact
  as of late this board is what /trash/ was supposed to be i think the mods are legitimately afraid of the furfags over there would do if they started moving all these shitty /a/  /v/ threads there again
as of late this board is what /trash/ was supposed to be  nah theyre just trying to kill a problematic subculture by 4chanifying it with generic garbage users
so /qa/ im going out with this girl and she seems very interested always sending these shy cat gifs whenever we text but like she rarely gets back to me i texted her on monday and she still hasnt looked at it shell go online but she wont look at it but keep in mind she just got a new phone so i dont think she knows proper etiquette do i dump this girl
shes cheating on you with chad
  i want real adice here r9k please leave anyway she wouldnt cheat on me anyway since shes told me she hates all the rich people at her uni and she doesnt go out much
muh future asian wife would love me after first date and never go a day without texting    i wouldnt think shes right for you especially since its been days the fact that she let you feel the pain of waiting and not caring and not even so much as show up around your dorm means shes probably texts those cat things to every person she meets
oh and even if you say  no im the only one she texts too  you still havent inspired her to be someone who is obsessed with talking to you    i would never want to be a with a girl who isnt a tiny bit clingy after the first date  all these mind game things in my experience just shows  im going to treat him nice but i dont see doing anything too serious with him    just think for a minute if she got a new phone why hasnt she done something like  boyfriend look at my new phone 3  setting you as wallpaper xd
  i dont know i asked her younger sister and she says since she got her phone she doesnt even text her for days and she doesnt know where she is most if the time originally i thought she was playing hard to get but i think she may be just weird so my new plan is to ignore her back until she comes to her senses because chasing her more isnt gonna make it any better
  shit youre right although this girl might just be super weird on the scale because i havent even been able to get a solid read on her on our first date she hugged me super excitedly and told me to text her when i got home now its just nothing
  youve got to find her irl give her a hug and ask her what the problem is  even if she rejects you at least you know    find her now
  i aprreciate your enthusiasm but i legitimately dont know where she lives plus her and her sister live apart plus i dont know what uni class she has and the campus is huge im legitimately at the mercy of those texts which sucks too since she got me into goblin slayer
ask politely to sniff her butt and post results
  emotional attachment is a bitch isnt it but you have to realize in the grand scheme of things goblin slayer is just an anime nothing more who cares who recd it to you  here fren do this    text right now  girl from science class just agreed to go out with me  if you dont respond im blocking you and going out with her    and if she doesnt respond back ignore her    women love controlling guys who have female followers  theyre also retarded as shit    if you texting that you have a girl lined up ready to replace her doesnt cause her to enrage shes not the one    guys who are able to lie on the spot have all the power in the world
    what is this trash doing on /qa/
  i dunno man thats kinda psychopathic plus id feel kinda pathetic baiting her just for attention although in the other hand if she just goes alright i dont care i could make a soft exit
  psychopathic  correct    who do you think the leader of world are  psychopaths  what about chad chaddingtons  psychopaths they want every beta male to die in the grand scheme of things    you want to kill every single raw emotion in your body and replace it with logic  you want a girlfriend right youre not harming anyone at all by lying to her are you so why not do it    when you ask out a girl in front of crowd you feel embarassed  but if you were a psychopath you wouldnt feel these emotions would you          i wish i became a psychopath at a young age i wouldnt be so weak now  but yes  psychopaths are the key to making it in this world its a very dangerous power really a lot of psychos do weird shit like torture small animals hence why so many serial killers have no problem getting women like ted bundy  but you want to remain true to your old self once you transition to being a psycho
  nah that doesnt sound right being a psychopath is mentally damgaging probably the reason chads do the things they do is because they just have no moral compass see they still feel emotions they just repress them
  but now that you read muh posts the ideas of being a psychopaths are in your mind and they are sleeper cell ready to strike  the next time youre talking to a random bitch and you want to make yourself look impressive  lie lie and lie  and lie to a lot of guys too to make yourself look cooler  lie about the amount of women youve slept with     i wish i learned the act of lying young  i saw a guy talk to two roasties and was bragging how he was playing violin  you know how cool i would look if i went up to him and told i was payed to play violin for someone in highschool   they would probably be like  oh anon please show us your skills  and right there    you have people begging to meet with you  thats when you tell them  oh you want me to meet well i have a date tomorrow with a girl on tinder  and right there you look like youre popular to two sluts    when faggots ask you why yourre not around just say youre one dates lol    ohhh  lying is so great its the best mind games ever and pisses so many people off    i really want a cig smoking asian wife now
  kill yourself you dumb fucking norm
  
fuck all of you in your heads she responded and asked if i was going to a concert
  are you sure youre old enough to post here you have to be at least 18 years of age
  fuck off
  lol she controls you by the ballls  tell her you might be busy cause taking a girl out to dinner
  uhh idc
  i dont even care about this sites formalities fuck you for clicking on a thread you knew youd hate and piss off because im out d
  i worded it into the response i said i might be busy but ill see if i can make it
  i might be busy  with what virgin club  tell her youre dating a blonde girl and that if she doesnt dye her hair youre forcing a threesome
  what the hell man you have some problems
                if you are not purposefully acting like a retard you need to stop posting
  she male saw you crying itt and sent you a sympathy text
  concert went well it was super cold so we had to huddle together
get this shit off of my board
  shove yourself into a woodchipper faggot
big  fat  heaving

cant wait to play this on my nintendo switch
  ninja gaiden is coming to the switch
  no i meant the doa beach game but im sure they will port ninja gaiden games to the switch soon too
  i was just jokin around i knew you meant doa 
  heaving is right  thats disgusting
  switch cant process the meat juggle physics
  its literally coming out on the switch along with haptic feedback via hd rumble
  they added fart rumbling
  kill yourself
the loli poster are getting really restless they are just spamming /v/ with lolis and they want their board back can we give them their board back before they nuke the whole site with loli
i say let them try more phone rangeblocks
you already know the answer is no
its /l/  lolikon
the fuck is wrong with her leg
if the point if the blue board split was to court more advertisers i dont see why adding back /l/ to primary 4chan would be a problem
  if /l/ is added pedophiles will still spam their lolishit outside of their containment board anyway best not to pander to pedophiles and attract more of them
  only if we can post shotas too
  explain /mlp/ mods can be ruthless in their stupidity
  if you dont like pedophiles then youre on the wrong website
  what is there to like them for do you want a /pd/ board where people jack off to pedophiles
  no
day of the rope soon freaks
  anime duh
  you get assassinated by soros funded pmcs  pssh nothin personnel nazi
  yeah because ponyfags and poltards dont ever leave their containment boards right
you can only buy passes with crypto    surely this will make more people buy them
you could previously buy it with paypal but paypal are big chuckefucks who think lowering the amount of sites their own service can be used on is somehow a good idea
  no its cause they are gikges
we havent had one in a while post your desktops and comment on others
having a desktop
same as last time
  cant stand all of those shortcuts
  yeah why do i have two war thunder and vscode shortcutes
  please tell me this is ironic  do weebs really make their working environment as autistic as this
desktop thread

nice desktops
  is that netscape in the launch bar
i just have a pure black screen should i try to transition to a picture background

  if you want to pure black is useful for some purposes it looks a lot nicer in cases where a program wont expand to cover the full screen
  best anime
  just be yourself
lets make pixel stuff /qa/    after you download it you need to activate a free license here  if you want to remove the watermark  theres an option to also resize the image but it worked so well for tenshi that it was 41 by 41 pixels so i didnt use it for the op image
is there a mobile version
  dont think so
  thank you very much mr roboto
  im not a hero
maybe you have to fiddle with it but im not getting very impressive results
      these look really nice
can someone do this one for me i dont want to download it
  deep
  nice thanks
can someone pixelate this one
    based and thanks
  do you mind posting sliders i cant seem to get anything to look this good
  yeah that and these ones too     i couldnt get it to look good either
    im cheating and using 8bit photo lab because id been looking for a good excuse to toy around with it some more i can get similar results in pixelator the main differences are that i dont see a way to set the colors used or alter the dithering pattern with pixelator
kill yourself yoogee kill yourself
  i was wondering how you got the palettes thanks anyhow
  which settings are the most important to adjust
  looks much more like the zun style now
another attempt
  spaghetti maker for snes
wonder if this could be used for that /qa/ game
turned out pretty well
    looks like something out of an actual game
  thats cute as fuck
pixels
  this ones really nice
there are 4 reddit threads in the catalogue is it time for /qa/ have a regular reddit general
ask on twitter
no because theyre either made for trolling or impshit from mods without end just ignore them until they gracelessly fall from the board
  who the fuck are you
this thread should keep its brothers company
i think its happening
  disabled ublock for a second yep its google ads
bsazone_15427299240770_123456  ze numbers what do they mean
go to ublock origins options  my filters  add the line  bsacnt
  1542729924077  some unix timestamp from a few days ago
  can i do it with adblock
  based
  201928 days  adblock  oof
  dont do this it makes mustard gas
reply form is stuck the top using 4chanx  realize buyselladsnet is now showing up in noscript  allowing it makes it work  no doubt more shady as fuck ads  i cant wait for 4channel to fall flat on its fucking face when this trash also inevitably gets fucking blacklisted
  why you still using adblock bro
  thanks for this
  using assblock  nigga i bet you still using utorrent
already blocked it
  is it a bad thing
  whats a bittorrent  im still using emule to download 480p avi porn from hacked chinese peers
  utorrent yes use qbittorrent/rtorrent/deluge/transmission instead
lmao why is google supporting a site with daily loli threads on the video games board
  the program is full of questionable ads my antivirus was constantly chimping out because of utorrent it even tries to force them into your navigator    there are better options see 
  
  thank you sir
  but i use the old version 221  no ads
  its also closed source if you want to trust a shady company like this go ahead but that doesnt make any sense considering there are open source alternatives to it
  if you use an old version of microtorrent from before the devs sold out and jumped ship its a pretty decent client  nowadays id probably stick to tixati for if you care about stuff or vuze/qbit if you dont
  i was the same until i updated it what a bad surprise that was  1 week after i got rid of it and installed qbittorrent
  thats why i never update it
  user was banned for this post
  fuck yea nigger thanks
stop being bored and motivate yourself by watching anime for little girls
two things i love
i prefer anime thats for little girls and adult men
  how can old women and young guys ever understand the pure love between young girls and old guys
  whats the best little girls show
  i want to fuck laala
  me in the first range
  sakura probably
  would this count as a little girls show
  did a lot of little girls watch it
wish i was a little girl
  rayearth
  top to bottom or left to right
  little and girls
  no dirty old men need to stay away from pure little girls
  is it alright if they dont do any ecchi things
i watched a few episodes of this show which is probably for toddlers       ive also been browsing s4s more and more frequently my brain is slowly deteriorating from years of doing almost nothing browsing this damned website i think it might be time to pull the plug before i start eating glue or something
  just let yourself deteriorate into nothing whats the worst thatll happen you die happy
  no you are being reborn as a japanese loli do it more
  are you watching it with spanish subs
  what if he wants to be reborn as a russian loli in japan
sophiechan is literally me
  let me touch you
  iif you insist
  a real loli
  yes most certainly  
no anime is made for little girls its all made for middle aged japanese wage slaves to distract them from their horrible horrible corporatized existence in an effort to delay their inevitable suicide as long as possible so as to not interfere with corporate profit     if your life is so terrible that it appeals to you also you should probably make some changes
  how do you explain  then
  do you think most of the viewers fall into the former category or the latter
  i cant know for sure so unless youve got some statistics of your own ill be forced to assume its 50/50
  the former statistically precure is emblematic of little girl anime in japan
  i mean you could theoretically say that the precure movie almost matched venom due to only japanese businessmen going to see it but i highly doubt that and think you can more likely attribute the sales to little kids going with their families
      so basically youre all saying that you share more in common with little japanese girls aged 412 than with japanese men aged 1635
  but of course why would anyone want to have more in common with the average soulless japanese salaryman than the bright and hopeful japanese little girl
  dunno where you got that from what i said im just sharing demographical statistics
  its clearly from salarymen going to see it with their little girls
  god no wonder they draw their lolis like american little girls
  shes adorable
on the topic of precure im not sure id be too against 3d anime if it were to look like precures eds throughout    
  houseki no kuni had some pretty good looking cg but yeah precure eds are toptier smooth dokidoki has my favorite dance probably followed by smile    
  even though i completely agree with houseki no kunis cg being pretty much perfect i think it was because the characters werent entirely human i mean they were supposed to be human shaped jewels and i think that the cg lent itself perfectly to that look im not sure how it would have turned had they been flesh and bones
i want to fuck a precure
  i want to get beat up by a precure
  bored girls
  we know moot
  i want to be a precure
  boys cant be precures
  what if he turns into a little girl when he transforms
  oh no no no
what are some of the benefits of watching anime for little girls
  dunno man it just makes me feel all giddy and happy
  they make you feel good in more ways than one
  theyre cute and fun
gookmoot says we can have one  since /pol/ is being forced out of its own containment board and all its knuckledraggers are coming here how do we keep /pol/acks away so we can actually discuss weapons and militaria instead of having each thread be a best gun to kill basketball americans thread
  /pol/acks are often cancer but completely censoring threads about gun laws/military politics would be pretty gay i suggest we just ignore /pol/ tier threads unless they have completely no relation with weapons/war/hunting/social collapse
by not responding to the threads about the melanin enriched as well as post more threads about topics that people find interesting not 9mm meme threads
  /pol/ is the least of your worries now that were no longer on da asshole of da internetz hurr hurr there are so fucking many newfag threads
  simply starve them of yous the only thing that brings /pol/ and /k/ together is rhodesia apparently just shuffle them there
  newfag threads are way better political echochambers  teaching and growing our community by helping newfags
  i hate niggers i love guns jews can go fuck themselves that said fuck all our political leaders right now no one is trying to restore anything just a bunch of dick wagging and cash checking trannies should hang
/k/ was always a /pol/ feeder board until the newfag plebbit invasion after sandy hoax
  can you imagine being one of the people who gather on reddit to launch raids like this lol    also fuck off nigger
  jesus fuckin christ this glows reddit
  states with erpo laws    washington    oregon     california    illinois     indiana    new jersey    maryland    florida    vermont    rhode island    connecticut    delaware    massachusetts    states with pending erpo laws    ohio    pennsylvania    michigan      how about the fact that every time we try to discuss gun laws it gets purged by the mods
  are you that quincy faggot
  the real question is how do we get you to stop pussyposting constantly
  newfags can integrate themselves i dont want to get overrun by retards who need their hands held quality over quantity im not going to accommodate invaders
  nice spacing anon
  tf you mean ohio guns might as well not exist here theres like no gun control laws outside of ccw on the books and no interest in bans right now
  fuck off and die  preferably painfully
  preferrably painfully  jeez you sound like a fag
  you must be a cool guy screenshoting your own post like that
  oh right i also forgot to mention the gun stock ban thread was deleted and it includes a bunch of other gun grabber stuff conveniently included      sorry about that i had to copy past it from infinitychan
bump
  fuck you nigger faggot communist bootlicking chump ive been here for years and ill not be changing because some young punk thinks he speaks for everybody /k/ has always had edge and niggers and kikes arent the focus here but ill be damnd if iam going to censor my language becasue it hurts your sensitive pussy ears buck up faggot this is /k/
  who cares just dont respond to them
  but what gun is best to kill basketball americans
  what weapons do the culturally enhanced that play niggerball carry
  hahahahahahahahahaha  best question
  using some shitty facebook meme  fuck off
  btw the best gun to kill niggers is a makarov or other cheap combloc import moar reliable than a hipoint and after you remov the electrical tape and drop it in a dumpster the local dog killers will just assume nig on nig crime probably a drug deal gone wrong    furthermore this is also the best gun for killing any other person including cis huwite males and having a chance of getting away with it
  no not only no but fuck no take your euro spec accommodationist bullshit fold it until its all corners and shove it up your ass with a firm twisting motion if newfags want to come here then they will integrate if they cant accept that theyre all probationary nigger faggots they should go to some site where their delicate little feelers wont get hurt and they should lurk moar     fuckwit
      holy shit just go to rddit thatll please your onions sensibilities faggots
  muh /pol/ is the enemy  hands down the quickest way to spot a leftypol or /r/liberalgunowners dipshit on this board  /k/ and /pol/ are allies the great majority of spics and niggers are anti gun 2a rights will be gone once whites are a minority
  this 2a and american values are white values shitskins were a mistake     
  an entire people unified    i dont think even the most ardent of fascists claim every ashkenazim is in on the nwo
  yeah thats a strawman argument i always see that orthodox jew from youtube posted who hates israel
  basically what the other mongoloids said if you dont like it here youre free to leave if you cant integrate with the namecalling or casual racism then reddit is probably more your thing and just because this greedy slanteyed dogeating yellow zipperheadgook kike mook does this divide and conquer bullshit with this gay 4channel stuff i wont censor myself for the sake of ad providers or to accomodate your queer ass here
reddit needs to fuck off  theyre like californians in that they wonder why their community is shit but when they move they immediately start rooting for what that made where they came from shitty in the first place
  /pol/ usually are the newfags look at what the 2016 election brought to the site      you cant say youre for rights when you would gladly deprive whatever groups you dont like or agree with of them in that regard /pol/ is the same as antigunners   inb4 claiming nazis expanded gun rights
  rights are a white conception so gtfo shitskin redditor
  then why are you speaking like you have the right to an opinion shut the fuck up and get back in line
anyone who hasnt had sex is barred you need a statement or note from a woman conducted on a live stream so no fakeies that youve engaged in consensual intercourse so you can post here    would take care of the pol problem quickly
  i believe that the gun debate and american politics in general is urban vs rural/maybe surburban truth is that the way of life between them is just way too different that being said the other truth is that the vast majority of people living in the rural parts of the country are white outliers being hispanics in places like the central valley in ca that have consistently voted republican 2016 elections being the fluke for some counties how do libs deal with this without pointing out just how marginalized rural whites are becoming make the struggle race based and pint the whites as the oppressor its not like your average urban shithead knows many rural people so theyll just take the talking heads or bloggers word for it     we have to end the oppression of the smug urbanite
  you need to go back
not only are we facing an invasion by normies and pinko faggots but now im seeing more chinks posting on here  thanks hiroshima now i cant go into a thread without seeing china irs numba wurn
  thats rpers from /int/
  you could just migrate to pic related uncucked and uncut just the way your mama likes it
  every board has recognizable disruption shills  the mods do nothing about shilling  but the problem is /pol/  /k/ has always been a racially tolerant board about diversity and miscegnation  okay dude you sound pretty informed
  dear plebbit please learn what r9k is there are more boards to 4chan than just /pol/ your shilling will be more effective if you do not sound as hilariously ignorant as this guy
  a belief in rights means the enfranchisement of everyone everywhere or it means nothing  nope defining rights means demarcating who gets them like the founders did and the reason they did it that way scout is if youre not careful with that then in a few generations nobody will have any rights its literally the first thing you learn when you study this properly and the reason they favored propertied males
    seething
  these kikes are everywhere now
  t kike
  then why are you here
    /tv/  admitting to browsing plebbit
  yes fellow 4channer     we should adopt a vote system for posts too
  the only thing that brings pol and /k/ together is rhodesia    what was the alamo    what is racial crime stats that lead to gun bans    what are genes that influence collectivist vs individualist thinking     what is the jq in relation to gun control    what is the original constitution
  only a newfag would say this shit
  my prog board  yeah you sound like you know what the kube is who phil is and have a copy of the dokument  every board on this site is going to be ruined the way /pol/ was  five threads at most in the catalog will be real ten to fifteen will be activists who hate /pol/ spamming obvious shillthreads and the rest will be bots asking each other what do you guys think
  based and redpilled
the /k/ruiser has been sinking for months now all the actual /k/ommandos abandoned ship as soon as this board became too waterlogged with the same shitposts from chicoms vatniks and /pol/tards alike now that /k/ is on 4channel all you faggots can finally see the water rising from the main deck and youre screaming /k/aptain o /k/aptain the /k/ruiser is sinking but the /k/rew of the /k/ruiser is waving goodbye as their lifeboats slip over the horizon as they set sail to discord servers redacted boards and even the dreaded r/guns because at least those redditors own and shoot their own firearms there unlike 99 of the dregs of human men still occupying this squalid board    its done /k/ died a long time ago look around everything that made /k/ a magical place has been gone and with it all of the quality /k/ommandos for those of you left enjoy rolling in your own shit you nogunz nofunz neonazi fuckers
  in the future avoid obvious shills except to tell newfags to do the same and pointing out how a particular op is a shill value and participate in real threads the mods will not help you reporting will get you banned avoid obvious bait
  teaching and growing our community by helping newfags
  literally nothing in that post was an arguement op is an 128oz big gulp sized faggot today
  holy dubs of truth
  wow those are authoritative sources professor
     ugg think /pol/ bad   haha ugg melanin enriched   haha grug basketball americans
  no
the best part of this lazy unmoderated takeover shilling is that scientologsts will eventually figure it out and there will be namecalling shills insisting that /k/ has always been a scientologist board because they say so
  balls /k/ will live forever
  martini henri
  nice demoralization shill but this board actually had all on topic and good threads until you came here bitching about  muh /pooooool/  muh jews  muh niggers
  found the /pol/
  draco  highpoint  tec 9  mac 10  pistol grip mossberg
  cringe and redditpilled
  cringe and nogunz
  /pol/ liking the constitution    all of my keks
  true but at least im not a limp wristed redditor its not hasguns that matters its what principals you adhere to
  thinks using reddit is worse than being nogunz  i respect redditors with guns because at least they support the 2nd amendment financially unlike you cum gargling shitstain get the fuck out
  continue to uphold genuine /k/ values while applying a layer of /pol/ repellent in the form of things that pol hates ie big anime tiddies furshit/dragon dildos whatever else makes them scream memewords for things they dont like in moderation and generally just using ones brain and being on the look out for people that are looking to use the board as a vehicle to disseminate whatever meme politicking theyve latched on to    
  chow down on some more deep fried lard and get a heartattack amerifat i couldnt support the 2nd amendment financially if i wanted
   tbuttblastedredditor
  i respect redditors
   drumpftards  can you actually fuck off like just leave and neck yourself your parents wont be happy about it but the world will be a better place for it
nice divide and conquere thread kikes daily reminder that if /pol/ loses your guns rights are fucking gone go ahead and be retarded apolitical faggots enjoy the mass control you stupid fucks
    where does hiro say we can have a meta thread
  i know that pic is bait but obligatory kys
  /pol/ seriously believes /k/ needs them
  heild digits and what are you gonna do try and elect some fucking libertarian not fucking happening youre gonna get gun control up your ass and youll do nothing about it
all this leftie shilling going on tonight  jews need to be gassed
   seriously believing there is a divide between pol and other boards    people arent this stupid right
    git the fuk out faggot     we need obese pasty skin irate mouthbreathers like we need nancy pelosi
  obama 8 years 0 gun control  trump 2 years bumpstock ban 1 gun control
  they dont get we are the other boards /v/ /tg/ /k/ /tv/ /a/ /o/ /po/
  hey then why not vote for hillary or the next democrat they serve up then surely itll be fine theyll respect your gun rights go ahead do it    you fucking retard
  if you dont like trump you must be for hillary
  you just said that obango just protected your gun rights why not vote for democrats then
/pol/ is filled are idealistic morons who cant even argue who parrot the most contrarian platform to current events     if this was a high school /k/ would be one of the jocks while /pol/ and /b/ would be eating glue in the special retard class supervised by the strictest mods
  he didnt protect my gun rights obama simply didnt get any gun control through when the democrats had the power  trump however is willing to sacrifice bumpstock in order to appease democrats and heal this dumbass divide between conservatives and liberals  doesnt help either when the nra is fine with this too
  heh wont matter either way with the demographics shift well practically be a one party country in a decade or two then the democrats can do whatever they want only way to stop things now and salvage this country is to go full /pol/ you faggots better buckle up were in for one hell of a ride
      calling retards retards for being retards counts as helping
  for now they are hitting purple states slowly
  hmm then i guess you should throw your vote away by supporting ron paul then and let the democrats take over its the only solution or you can decide not to throw the baby out with the bathwater and accept that things wont be perfect
  this right here faggots need to thicken their damn skin
  holocaust denial  only two several hundred thousand died and a substantial number starved because of allied bombings six million is a prophetic number claimed by jews jews in power perpetuate the six million myth glorifying the nazis as highly efficient killers instead of the bumbling retards they actually were because it fulfills some numerology bullshit you cant complain because your life is run by ashkenazi jews in every sector you damn antisemite now say israel is our ally even though theyre a /pol/ tier ethnostate that would be hated if it werent israel  abiotic oil  real possibility its fucking carbon in any case oil prices and the public perception of oil are clearly managed for economic gain  a single people is unified  ridiculous its literally what blacks say about whites an uncanny majority of the people in charge of blacks are white are all white boys keeping the brothas down no but 9 out of 10 people keeping a brotha down are white an uncanny amount of people in charge of the lives of whites are ashkenazi jews the fact that they do not belong to the same ethnic group they manage leads them to acting with a diminished sense of empathy and a streak of ignorance leading to policies that anger the cultural tendencies and natural temperaments of their defacto subjects this is not to say lol youre just like whiny niggers what white people do to africans is also wrong they are victims as much as they arent    t leftist master race    machine guns should be freely available registration free to anyone who is old enough to serve in the military and any law restricting their access must only raise the minimum age for military service
huh
  with gookmoots recent astroturfing of the site to make it advertiser friendly this image is more relevant to 4chan then ever
  im still surprised he even bothered how long do you suppose it will be before 4channel is blacklisted by advertisers lol
  name a single problem /pol/ has with the original bill of rights    remember that it only applies to white men btw    
  pretty much already are i imagine
  this is an elite post my good sir    hh
  this and youd have to be dumb or disengenous not to realize patterns surrounding jews    almost everyone on this list of the top political donors an uberkike
  you have no rights in my country unless your white    go home
  us whites can have open discussion because we have common interest    a lamb has to reason to debate the future of its flock with a wolf
      this is a mandatory redpill for all 4chan anons    please brothers do yourself a favor and watch this
  urban is just a euphemism for nonwhite
  the un and cia are literally spending millions of dollars to shut us down    
  ebin upboat fellow redditor v    you sure owned those drumpf loving poltards
  dont worry theyve already realized what an empty hack drumpf is already with his amount of tweeting and not fulfilling any promises
  fine message but absolutely cringe delivery tbqh
  this
  we were here first fuck off
  cringe
  you clearly dont get what a newfag is you can be new to 4chan lurk for a bit till you understand the culture and then participate like anyone else newfags pollute the site by bringing in their shit and not adapting at all they let their newness show and dont give a fuck
  whats wrong with jews
  most of us left /k/ for a long time to take the gun control battle to /pol/ and there we realized the only way to enforce our gunrights is through actual fascism since the marxism here is reaching the event horizon of societal and moral decay     if you think /k/ was any different then youre wrong the only noticable difference ive noticed from my bi yearly return to /k/ checkup now is that there are more people same content just more people that originality that was /k/ never really changed or evolved people talk about the same exact shit on here today as they did back in 09 the reason we had magical shit like willismkillis great nuggetfests etc was simply because there were fewer people and that made things a little more close knit     tldr   quit crying
  thank you these definitions are neither written nor even set in stone it feels like  i hope i can get the hang of it soon
  there are a ton of whites in urban areas and theyre one of the major forces pushing for all the liberal bullshit along with jews
  i sense some projection  take your skittles alice
  when are you running for president you have my vote
  based
kill the racism here and you just get yet another reddit    i come here to talk about guns and shit on niggers
  the only way to enforce our gunrights is through actual fascism since the marxism here is reaching the event horizon of societal and moral decay  enforce our gunrights  fascism  enforce  rights  uhh
  1 upvote
  i wish could i could guild you friend
does anyone else really hate jews
  i dont think you know what projection is maybe you shouldnt just repeat things you see posted here
  and redpilled
  ignore them by that i both mean dont feed actual stormniggers the replies they want and also dont call someone a fucking nazi just because they said nigger you fucking nigger
remember before leftypol came here and started crying anytime someone said the nword
the best way to keep /k/ the way it is is to ignore threads you dont like post threads you want to see instead of waiting for them to go up take a part in discussion in the things you believe in it shouldnt be that complicated people shit up threads and boards its part of dealing with the retardation except instead of anon blowing up a gas bomb we have antigun faggots
  teaching and growing our community by helping newfags  please spoonfeed me on how to 4channel because i am too retarded to browse the catalog and read a few threads   this is why nobody likes you mouthbreathers
  who ever holds the power of the military makes the rules nationalist right wing fascism can assure gun rights and property rights its all about who holds the power the left learned this and took advantage of this a long time ago
  if this was a high school /k/ would be one of the jocks
  ah here we go again
  /pol/ isnt even an echo chamber rdditor they only scream louder than any other opinion you dont see people getting banned off /pol/ for wrong think
  if this was a high school /k/ would be one of the jocks  you seriously thought this analogy would be fine what are you 16
  got a good chuckle out of me
  its okay you can say niggers
  fuck you retard
/k/ was racist and antisemitic before /pol/ or /new/ even existed there were threads on killing niggers every day back when the word was filtered and we had to say redguard or basketball american before half of you tepid neocons even knew what 4chan was    half of the /k/ommandos you scream at to gb2 pol for expressing any view more extreme than jeb bush have never even been to /pol/ stop telling us to go back to a home board that was never ours we were here first i didnt watch the moot/wt snacks civil war worrying the site was ending so some 19yo centrist could police my language over a decade fucking later
  pretty much this
    pretends to be a /k/ommando  actually admits to being a redditor  something something people who hurt my feefees are nazis  im not a newfag i swear    wow its like you didnt even proofread your own bait
hiroshimoot forbade meta threads from being anywhere except /qa/    this thread is offtopic
            oy vey jews       now look at percent jew by state what a coincidence
  if jews stop being jews pol wont exist you need to rethink your strategy
when did this board get filled with all of these freedom hating statists
  i say we start merging generals    handguns and revolvers /hrg/  assault and battle rifles /abrg/  shotguns and boltactions /sbg/ hunting  sniper rifles and target pistols /tag/   helicopters and aircraft /hag/  ships and submarines /ssg/  armor and tanks /atg/  ordinance and artillery /oag/  firearm accessories /fag/
  this would clean up our board a lot
  why wouldnt you
  as evidenced by the content of this very thread we are being invaded at any given moment a significant amount of threads on this fucking shithole of a board are filled with larping stormfaggots these threads arent related to weapons and they dont contribute anything in the form of meaningful or intelligent discussion why should they be allowed to exist if the useless jannies shared two neurons between themselves to rub together theyd fucking nuke them instead of sucking on hotpockets this place went down the toilet after 2016 i dont know why i even bother fighting it anymore when so many piggies likeyou are so obviously pleased to be rolling around in the shit i unironically support a 7day ban from posting on /k/ if you post on /pol/ the average /pol/tard shitlicker is too stupid to know what a vpn is so it would weed out the vast majority of them
    we would be on the football team for sure though
  conservatism is the new counterculture /pol/  calling anyone a bootlicker  waste of sevens honestly
  i hate /pol/ but i would rather have them than a bunch of fucking newfags ruining /k/ and 4channel as a whole  more than it already has been    post2016 has been horrible and its not getting any better and for once its not /pol/ or /v/s fault
  there are no words
      yea the people like op bitching about this are just jews themselves i get it if you dont like the rhetoric but if you seek to ban it you are a fucking faggot
welcome to /qa/
wtf each board is allowed a meta thread fuck jannies and fuck niggers
  traditionally gun laws and gun control go to /pol/
  but thats wrong you silly boy
  the corpse is still fresh senpai  its not until they have to prop this place up with bots spamming the same regurgitated shit that the advertisers will realize and theyll pull the shekels its already halfway there now  hiroshi is a blind stupid cunt if hed shoahed the mods/trannies left over from moots luggage lad/gawker fiasco he could have saved this place    point for case faggot mod moves thread  never wouldve happened under poolesclosed as long as it was a legitimate gripe he would have participated in the gripe to figure out how to fix it    weev was right  too bad  so long  thanks for all the fish
  no thats literally true hirojew said each board can have one meta thread to discuss the board itself

  she is really almost named clover    to choose voice actors we need sample scripts    for example  hello anon  im clover here i dont like to introduce myself cause i hate the human being  cats shouldve taken over this plant not you guys  according to the contract i hereby announce that    good scripts have more characteristic passionate and funny elements  please give us your idea
  god is dead
  did you see my script hiro  
found the script  
  hiro who is your waifu
isnt it like 200 am in japan    nothing wrong with that script i like it too someone can analyze that and figure out the baselines for her
  accurate i nominate shekerubergu as official representative jewtuber
  oh no dear anons ive received some messages and theyve been saying the meanest stuff about me things like calling me a shill    how rude of them im making those videos just for you yes you dear anons im not here to get people to buy passes so that hiro can put shady ads all over the site right right anons sure say the silliest things hahahahahaha    hahahahaah yes yes i am just buy the damn passes or hes gonna dock my pay again
  daily reminder

nobody care about your 3dpd western whore slut voice    kill yourself you worthless trash gook

  stop pretending you dont speak perfect english gook
  utau  so this is the vocaloid for free
  uuso
    anime is gay
  fuck you you stupid nigger i hope you die
  i like the idea that shes willingly ignorant we really need to discuss her personality more before submitting scripts i know it doesnt really matter because shell be nothing but a cruely milked cashcow anyway but
  well at least youre honest this would be much easier if we had a design that looks already looks like a specific kind of character and not just cute
munch
  hirosama please remove all the 3dpd idol from /jp/ or at least make them stay just in one general please thank you
  just get in contact with eilene im sure shell find you a really japaneseesque american voice actor easy
  well slowly go insane together
  i imagine at least half the girl vtubers half to have others get scripts to outline their episode if they even play the game themselves from what id imagine if you get someone with a good voice and good at acting they might not be good a playing games or commenting on them so just get someone else to play it and then afterward think up a script and just follow that overlayed on the video im not saying everyone does that but id imagine a bunch do
very disappointed a design that didnt incorporate the sfw nsfw and quote colors won  unbelievable really
  unironically this she actually did well to find moes va
  the cocaine makes it better
  outdated
  this also works for a script
  complains about lolicons  whole fame was based on the fact that she sounds like a loli   avatar is a loli catgirl  pot kettle
  and vtubers killed him
  anon you seriously underestimate how many vtubers there are
  would more vtubers mean more of them need teams or less i dont know what youre implying here
  to add a bit more i know a lot of them do it but there is too many to name that dont it isnt really necessary but if you can get a good scropt it works
  natsume moe basically just flat out said she doesnt like games too much and implied that shes just working of the scripts the team give her and others like the omega sisters are very obviously scripted even if they try to pretend theyre not just the way they edit it is stuff that can only work in postscript and then commenting over it
  all of elienes stuff is scripted but yea i was thinking about this wrong i would still say a majority are not scripted but most of the biggers ones are to some degree
hey haters    my name is clovertan and i hate every single one of you all of you are fat retarded nolifes who spend every second of their day trying to troll me you are everything bad in the world honestly have any of you ever laughed at memes i mean i guess its fun making fun of people because of your own insecurities but you all take to a whole new level this is even worse than making fun of reddit    dont be a stranger just hit me with your best shot im pretty much perfect i was just recently voted as the vtube model for 4chan and love spreading memes what hobbies do you do other than fap to 2d girls i also get straight as and have a cool voice actress she just voiced this shit was so cash you are all meme haters who should just kill yourselves thanks for listening    pic related its me and my voice actress
  just let s4s write everything
  cute post gookmoot
  omesis  scripted  pick one and only one
  basically any of the videos where she does a do you think ryu will notice are entirley done beforehand and then voiced afterward especially the spiderman done which was so obvious i was sitting there confused why they were just going through with it as if it was normal
  him  faggot
i have a ritual called terminator i crouch in the shower in the naked terminator pose with eyes closed i crouch for a minute and visualize either arnie or the guy from the 2nd movie i then start to hum the t2 theme slowly i rise to a standing position and open my eyes it helps me get through my day the only problem is if the shower curtain sticks to my terminator leg it sorta ruins the fantasy
im looking for a bento box it cant be pinku thats japanese for pink or any girl color it has to be of 2 or more kotoba thats japanese for 2 compartments and has be be chibi small sized and has to be really kawaii cute also it has to be about 1020 bux and you have to post pics of it first i want to make shure its kawaii cute and it would be nice if it came with matching chopstick holder with chopsticks oh and it cannot have any cartoon pictures or be made out of plastic it has to be made of ceramic or something like that also it would be nice if it was made in japan and not in china or corea korea or whatever i have found a bento box similar to the one im describing in ebay but it was 1 kotoba and i dont want my gohan rice to touch my other things it can get wet and i would not like that plus 2 compartments looks more kawaii
honestly i can totally understand why nyanners might want to privatize pomf pomf vid desu
now this is a story all about how  my life got flippedturned upside down  and id like to take a minute  just sit right there  ill tell you how i became the prince of a town called belair    in west philadelphia born and raised  on the playground was where i spent most of my days  chillin out maxin relaxin all cool  and all shooting some bball outside of the school  when a couple of guys who were up to no good  started making trouble in my neighborhood  i got in one little fight and my mom got scared  she said youre movin with your auntie and uncle in belair    i begged and pleaded with her day after day  but she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way  she gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket  i put my walkman on and said i might as well kick it    first class yo this is bad  drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass  is this what the people of belair living like  hmm this might be alright    i whistled for a cab and when it came near  the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror  if anything i could say that this cab was rare  but i thought nah forget it   yo home to belair    i pulled up to the house about 7 or 8  and i yelled to the cabbie yo home smell ya later  i looked at my kingdom  i was finally there  to sit on my throne as the prince of belair
  cringe
  i literally do this but i dont have a shower curtain 
scripted vtubers dont work just have a streamer do it all for you
the more i read about this the more i look forward to downvote it when its ready
hiro the next step is just to find a girl who has a good personality on her own with a good voice we vote on those and one gets sent the technology to do the acting then you tell her what to play or do for a video and she does it
  i always love this copypasta
  same fellow redditor
community server good or bad
just get one of those streamers on plexstorm they can talk well
  youre behind times they just use iphone x tracking for the entire face and body so the recording is done at the same time of the voice over while they use script and edition for the videos everything else is done at the same time    thats the app version for the complex videos they live feed the iphone x tracking to a vr program while they wear a vr set thats why they react to each other 3d appearance you can even load a tv of the game they are playing inside the vr and the goofy shit rei does with her ribbon is made with animation nodes in real time all of which is piss easy to learn    editing the videos is harder that actually needs a small group of 23 people
  actually they probably dont use a vr set they probably just watch the feed in front of a tv
vrchat and its many personalities are essentially the western twitch variation of the vtuber experience why not just start from there
  do you know more details and why since he isnt nice enough to tell us spoiler intensifiesi was hoping he would take pictures/bring /a/  /jp/ content or even interview zun for us eventually but nobody ever brought this up or spoke out i thought that perhaps one thing good could come off from him becoming admin what pipe dream
  i know its harder they still do it a lot of people equate getting people to watch your show with editing it to make it look better even if it would be easier and most of these channels are started by groups its in there head since most of the early ones started in teams they have to have teams too
yeah have boxxy voice it honestly   would be fitting
  wow holy shit   fucking dropped that is incredibly disappointing
  hows this  
  pomf was the only good thing sheve ever made  the fact that you would say this reveals how deeply bitter you are she insulted your fetish and now youre lashing out like a child you want to fuck
  lol pedohurt
  i think that means pomf is for lack of better word the only one of her works that is relevant worldwide people know her just because of that particular cover do you realize how many 3dpd doing covers and the generic stuff nyanners does theres on yt
  i believe it was a pointed remark nyanners was not only that video
  yet people only listen to that cover
  thats not even true though
  i wonder in what world that isnt true
  his world
    in a world where you arent a couple of newfags  nyanners was already fairly well known before the pomf video and her videos pull in thousands of views she has 63k followers on twitch it doesnt even need to be explained that shes more popular than the video pedos got mad at her for pulling the video down yet shes still doing well years after the fact  its really on you to prove that the video is her only success
  pedos got mad at her for pulling the video down  fuck off faggot and stop with your gayass narrative people were pissed because she was turning her back on the edgy humor she got popular for and most of them probably werent lolicons at all youre just a gayass whiteknight faggot beta orbiter
  people were pissed because she was turning her back on the edgy humor she got popular for  that was part of it im not denying the fact that there were more angles to the situation but the fact that the anon focused on the pomf video and posted the antipedo post goes to show that he was one of the pedos who got mad about being demeaned for enjoying loli  she said other things during that time as well but he focused on the pedo angle    i mean you can try to deny the fact that pedos were mad but you wont convince me that it didnt happen because i was following her on tumblr at the time and saw everything she was posting even expressing my annoyance but maying your cries of denial will gain support from other vindictive newfags
  well known   thats what happens when you spam and shill on 4chan besides she streamed loli and yuri on her twitch she was in pursuit of attention fag a dissociated circlejerk from the average /a/non gave it to her like they always do the fucking pomf video is the central role in her popularity
  it really sounds to me like youre complaining that 4chan lolicons think shes a faggot for taking down a loli video yeah she is a fucking faggot for it she is a total fucking landwhale tumblr whore for going all sjw on the lolicons and yes youre also a faggot for trying to defend her and tell us we have to be okay with her being a fucking faggot
  wouldnt it be better if cloverchan attacked reddit since those are the nerds that comes in pack disguised and are always trying to troll on 4chan
  so you agree she gained popularly before the pomf video as ill gotten as you attempt to portray it i really dont care how she became popular so im not even going to argue against the hows of the matter but the fact that she was popular is all that matters  and then her other videos also became popular after the pomf video  and then after deleting the video she still remains popular when she made that blog post she boasted 100k subscribers now she has over 400k      it really sounds to me like youre complaining that 4chan lolicons think shes a faggot for taking down a loli video  well yeah how can you act all righteously indignant when youre a fucking pedophile if the reason for your anger is that you were insulted for being a pedo then you really have no ground to stand on sorry childlover
  no its not because im a pedophile although i do admit i am its because shes a slimy virtual signalling hypocrite who betrays her original fanbase for politically correct social brownie points i genuinely believe distancing yourself from your original group because they make you look bad makes you a more disgusting person than being a pedophile also i think its time for you to leave youve betrayed all the signs of being yet another worthless fucking redditor
  distancing yourself from your original group because they make you look bad makes you a more disgusting person than being a pedophile  yeah she really should have remained loyal to the her pedophile supporters
  so you agree she gained popularly before the pomf video  thats not popularity thats a circlejerk every streamer or youtuber that clearly cater to such groups have one they consume whatever its the same as saying every obnoxious tripfag is popular and wellknown well theyre but not for good reasons
  you can put a negative connotation on what it was but she pulled numbers
  you wanna know a good reason for her popularity aka recognition pomfpomfpomf what about bad reasons for her lets go with appearance due to spam instead anything before pomf the point is im sure theres a lot of youtubers with numbers out there but you know what they didnt release pomf thats why i dont know about them which is also why nobody is broadcasting posting or listening anything from them
  they didnt release pomf thats why i dont know about them  and there we have it youre projecting
can you two just make out already
  you dont know what popularity means one can be aware about them that doesnt translate into following or watching their garbage a single sub from reddit can turn someone popular however thats extremely subjective form of popularity popularity doesnt work that way for example pomf is spread everywhere among the otaku culture not just some audience subscribed to a channel
patch it
  its a charm point
  so no one else finds it interesting that the newfag redditor is trying to rewrite history based on his personal experience
  do you have any reading comprehension
  yep you appear to have knowledge of how much notoriety a subreddit will net a person you also said you didnt know about nyanners until the pomf video by these factors it becomes clear that you found nyanners while browsing reddit and now youre projecting your experience on everyone else
  nice try but ive never said that dont tell me this is the episode where reddit shit on reddit
  you never said which   a single sub from reddit can turn someone popular however thats extremely subjective form of popularity  or  they didnt release pomf thats why i dont know about them
  yeah she really should have remained loyal to the her pedophile supporters  yes she should have this isnt facebook faglord
  for example  there you go
  you said for example in reference to something other than reddit you offered the reddit anecdote dry without pretense why would you use an example of something youre unfamiliar with you must be reasonably sure about how trends are handled on reddit in order to use it as an example i mean an example really falls apart unless both parties are at least somewhat familiar with the subject matter of the example so here you are trying to use an example that you assume i would know because its something you know

  lets say i needed to be familiar with reddit to come up with that thing i honestly dont and nop i dont take pride in not being more familiar with reddit i have 2 brain cells to have a grasp of everything surrounding me first you need to know your enemy in order to combat it youre probably lacking 2 brain cells
  yes of course you only visit reddit because theyre the enemy you were doing reconnaissance on reddit when you came across the pomf video thats how everyone learned who nyanners was
  are you from /pol/ i only mentioned reddit once just to make a point
  pedophiles are less harmful to children in average than brainwashed normalfags like you
  i get the point it was a bad point youre supposing that before the pomf video only a small community knew who she was therefore she wasnt truly popular well there are a number of factors that you have no account of  how many people on 4chan are part of other communities  what was the actual volume of people within the 4chan community  wouldnt the fact that the pomf video spread be an indication that she already had wide appeal since someone must have posted it around allowing it to make the jump to other communities  are we to assume that she was only known to 4chan at the time how can we take your word that she was  how do we account for the hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions of views on her older videos  are we basing popularity on a scale relative to the internets growth    i mean are we really going to argue all these points are you even equipped to answer all this or will your argument amount to please believe me honestly its more fun just to point out the fact that your a redditor filtering history through your perspective
  yikes
  she were born on 4chan and that was her selfstage she herself confirms this on top of recording memes and pastas from different boards and posting it in threads what else theres to say
  so that speaks to her beginnings that doesnt prove she wasnt popular before the pomf video
  do you call attention whores poplar
  when they acquire a sufficient amount of attention yes
  she was never a boxxy
  you dont need to be a boxxy in order to be popular still what you say is false because caties youtube channel has fewer subscribers so nyanners did in fact exceed boxxy
  subscribers are your epenis nyanners people know your name because of the pomf song regardless of what you think people knew boxxy because boxxy was boxxy
    before pomfpomfpomf nyanners had become somewhat notorious on /v/ since she appeared in the first /v/gas along with duke and that was a massive shitshow following the /v/gas people made shitposting threads about her daily and since 2011/2012 /v/s moderation was even worse than it is now they were rarely deleted prior to the /v/gas nyanners was primarily only known on /a/ and only had a very small amount of interest towards her and she got lumped in with other cute anime girl voice people like lilypichi and cirno so nyanners was largely completely unknown before the /v/gas which then drew her a lot of attention from 4chan and almost exclusively 4chan until she then made pomfpomfpomf which blew up due to both the subject matter and it being a cover of ponponpon which was at the time incredibly popular worldwide along with nyanners being promoted by people like swordva and ken ashcorp  so basically youre a newfag who has no idea what youre talking about    also its funny that you were pushing this paedophile hate angle against the guy you were arguing with so hard when nyanners herself was vocally a huge fan of loli porn until she went full sjw and suddenly totally always hated it
  dont do that weird obsessive thing where you speak to the person as though theyre really here it jsut makes you look crazy
eh youve never seen a pair of breasts before and youre how old jjeez ahahahah wwell wed better fix that then just close your eyes for a sec aaaaaaand    here boing    ahahahaha you should have seen the look on your face jjeez anon thththeyre just sacks of fat on my chest ya know do they really excite you that much gget a look at this then see how they bounce up and down jiggle jiggle ii bet you want to squeeze them too dont you mr perverted virginboy anon ggo right ahead honk these honkin honkers as much as you want take your time heck ssuck on em too i know you really want to just be careful my nipples are super hard right now ccant imagine whyyyy    iiiiii bet you wanna see my vagina too you pervert wwwell were already this far might as well im not wearing ppanties anyway    sssso what do you think well i guess that ragin rection in your pants answers that question hahahahaha yyyoure such a pathetic pervert anon iiii bet its the first one youve seen since you slid out of your mothers lllook how wet it is too jeezums fucking crikes its so fucking wet iive never seen it this wet before look what youre doing to me you freaking pervert yyou sure know how to make a girl all hot and bothered oh lordy christonastick youd better take some responsibility for this aafter all when its this wet its much easier to cram something up there and im leaking like a freaking sieve here youd better pppplug it up right now
i was going to say that she should ignore anything related to the stupid memes like stacy npc tranny or whatever spam because they are not representative of what 4chan should be and then i realized   i was wrong this is 4chan this is definitely the current 4chan  spamming frogs spamming incel npc buzzwords bullshit spamming gay threads spamming overall low quality shit this is the actual state of 4chan    good luck having an interesting 4chan vtuber with that
  also its funny that you were pushing this paedophile hate angle against the guy you were arguing with so hard when nyanners herself was vocally a huge fan of loli porn until she went full sjw and suddenly totally always hated it  to elaborate for a moment i forget the name of the artist of pic related but he was one of her favourite artists
are you two still arguing
  i mean youre kind of making my argument for me youre giving all these credentials explaining how popular she was and then saying she wasnt popular you cant just say well she got all this attention and then in the same breath say well it doesnt really count because reasons  4chan was already denouncing nyanners by the time it was known that she was doing the /v/gas doing the typical routine of shes popular now so its reddit and i hate it  she was able to collaborate with others because of the name she built for herself    also its funny that you were pushing this paedophile hate angle against the guy you were arguing with so hard when nyanners herself was vocally a huge fan of loli porn  maybe i dont know how she felt about loli back in 2011 or whatever but lets assume thats true what does that matter whats the point youre making here that i should hate her for once being a pedo  the point was never simply to say that i hate pedos the point was that pedos are unjustifiably mad and if the source of your ire is that someone stopped being a pedo then you really dont have any ground to stand on fucking kidoggler
  youre giving all these credentials explaining how popular she was and then saying she wasnt popular  i said she wasnt popular though youre acting like i said she had 2 followers and interpreting it as she had 200 followers just take what i said at face value frankly even reading the whole discussion between you two i still have no idea what point youve been trying to make this whole time  4chan was already denouncing nyanners by the time it was known that she was doing the /v/gas  nyanners was barely known outside of /a/ at that point so no nyanners herself didnt even browse /v/ she did the /v/gas because the guys who organised it told her that /v/ loved her which was a lie since at that point most of /v/ had no clue who she was and the few times she did get discussed it was mostly negative unlike on /a/  she was able to collaborate with others because of the name she built for herself  she was able to work on the /v/gas because the people who made it liked her and reached out to her the same deal with duke who you may note was also primarily a guy involved with /a/ and not /v/  what does that matter whats the point youre making here  that shes a liar and a hypocrite it would be one thing to say i used to like this but i dont like it anymore but she wants to pretend she never liked it in the first place and was just pressured into pretending she did thats weaselly as fuck  the point was never simply to say that i hate pedos the point was that pedos are unjustifiably mad and if the source of your ire is that someone stopped being a pedo then you really dont have any ground to stand on fucking kidoggler  ah of course for calling out nyanners actions that means i myself am a paedo getting involved in this conversation was a mistake
  i said she wasnt popular though  again you gave examples as to why she is popular so saying she isnt popular doesnt make sense you act like /a/ and /v/ are small when theyre quite large you act like nyanners was only known on 4chan as if word doesnt quickly get around about this girl with the anime voice you cant prove that her presence was isolated to 4chan    i still have no idea what point youve been trying to make this whole time  well the very core of this argument is that the anon was being a big baby about nyanners saying mean things toward pedophiles so he insisted that the pomf video was her only claim to popularity i disagree    nyanners was barely known outside of /a/ at that point so no  ok so now youre trying to tell me im wrong about something i was around to witness so youre going to need evidence so good that it convinces me my memory is wrong do you have that not likely so im just going to dismiss this    she was able to work on the /v/gas because the people who made it liked her and reached out to her  yeah thats the benefit of being popular people want you to do things be around you collaborate    she wants to pretend she never liked it in the first place  this doesnt really matter to me however i do find it hilarious that you cant see the problem with admitting that you like loli you might as well be putting a huge im a giant pedo sign on your back because thats how society will treat you whether you like it or not how about this when hundreds of thousands of people recognize your real name and know where you live and potentially where you work you proclaim that you used to like loli when youre that brave then you can call hypocrisy on others but you wouldnt even be brave enough to give me your online handle right now

  this one brought back some memories of old time /a/ it makes me wonder if the color wars is still going on 7 years after the show aired and if peterhausen is still top tier along with yellows hat
    what did hiroyuki  admin mean by this
  bookmark
  what are your thoughts on lolicon
  why do you want a modified ancient copypasta to be voiced
shouldnt hiro decide the character profile first like you usually see when they announce an anime like personality blood type their 3 sizes and all of that
  should we do this first
  i vote for 79/54/81
any plans on making 4chan more involved with the character most boards including /a/ seem to dislike the idea of a 4chan vtuber do you have any plans to win them over or to just make them participate with it a bit more
  for /a/ just throw in some keitai memes and we will get them by the dick
  nobody should be won over by this shit  all itll do is help flood this already sinking ship
  let me rephrase that    personality confident but a tad bit egoistic  blood type b  b/w/h 79/54/81
  3 sizes   if you want her to announce her as a slut by saying her 3 sizes might as well add in cup size as well
  shes not going to announce it herself of course just gonna need it for the character profile
  age 29  status virgin  occupation unemployed    just like me btw
  one week to plan the name/personality of the hole anime girl  are you playing dumb with us while make everything behind the scene again
  she should be an idf veteran who spent most of her deployment using a canning machine to can rations
  virgin  female  nobody is going to fall for that even the reverse memeers
  female  dont want her to be a virgin  who the fuck wants used goods you fuck this is fantasy let me fantasize you piece of shit
  i want her to be a virign too
race autistic
  now i cant fantasize an yuri love
  and thats a good thing dont want /u/ to ruin another thing i like

  a community server of sorts just in case  could help as a midway point for people who might hop on board from viewing content on youtube or wherever the video is embedded and shared unless hiro decides to pull something crazy like having 4chan doubleup as a videohosting site for clover content your viewpoints on how other communities function dont really matter here  just enjoy this ride for what it is  even if it is likely just a means for hiro and company to make some dosh off of advertising to sell passes    if youve got any problems with it or have recommendations or advice teach me how i can do better
  whoops   filtered your shitty discord server by accident
  he wants his vtuber to be ztv news  remember to cum back soon heh get it cum  how do i make fap sounds lets just say it involves a lot of jello wink nudge
  bringing zonetan here  thats funny because i thought that it would be fun for clover to use that kind of ztv news format    that way she could read some anon posts and call them huge faggets on live
  tfw clover will never call you a huge faggot  it hurts
how long until this idea gets dropped completely
  when hiro realizes you need to invest at least 100 grands to pay for a decent 3d model a good va it nerds to check everything its working fine a mocap suit and cameras a nasa pc to handle it a video editor a community manager for twatter and other social media and the various software licenses needed for the whole thing
  mocap  i almost thought you were serious for a second
  before pomfpomfpomf nyanners had become somewhat notorious on /v/ since she appeared in the first /v/gas along with duke and that was a massive shitshow    im like 95 sure that the /v/gas came out after pomfpomfpomf i may be misremembering but i didnt know nyanners before pomfpomfpomf but i do remember her being a part of the /v/gas after i say this as someone who browsed /a/ more than /v/ at the time and i dont remember her bumping on my radar at all cirno i remember before she did anything pomf related but thats also because she was a huge attention whore who posted literal cp of herself on /jp/ and /b/ because of how starved for attention she was theres still cp of her floating around if you dig into her as well nowadays she goes by raspdere and still attention whores but i think is less known out of the trio shes the outlier in that pomf wasnt the catalyst to her fame    posting with my old trip to prove i was actually posting around that era so you dont accuse me of being a newfag pretty sure you have the order of events wrong but again its also possible that i do as well i just really dont think /v/gas came out before pomf rather after and the whole reason she even became relevant enough to be a cohost on the /v/gas was because of pomf before then she was a literal who
  its hiro in vtuber form unless i was supposed to figure out a personality from cat plant contracts      hello everyone in case you did not remember my name is clover and i am the virtual youtuber or vtuber for 4chan today we will be visiting /g/ the technology board i wonder what i would like to talk about ah there is an internet browser thread i do not know too much but i remember the little blue e stands for internet explorer please wait i know i need to look around before posting to see what other people have to say  2018 // not using pale moon  using palememe // enjoy your furry aids  that is interesting why would this browser be a meme if no one has ever heard of it and why is this poster talking about furries i will report this post for being offtopic discussion hmm it seems a lot of people recommend qutebrowser that sounds like a cute browser i will try this one out  but it is confusing there is no adblock and i do not know how to go to different websites   hi fellow 4channers recently i have started using qutebrowser as you recommend but it is confusing because i have to type all the commands instead of pointing and clicking are there any browsers that would be better for me  internet explorer  ohoho /g/ is very smart too
  yes its harder to voice a character if you dont know what theyre supposed to do someone may be able to do a really good tsunarchetype character but fall completely flat when trying to do a serious one
  just use text to speech
  i get youre a complete retard and are wrong in all points but the thing that bothers me the most is that you think 3d  2d just because you get off to lolicon manga doesnt mean you want to fuck your real life 6 year old cousin lolicons are not pedos and pedos are not lolicons there is a whole dimension of difference and if you think a dimension isnt big deal then get the fuck out of this site you belong in facebook
  its sad to see 4chan falling so far behind it used to be the avantgarde of memes  i guess social media do make it easier and faster to develop a new meme because it gets refined rapidly inside a small group of circlejerks and then spreads through existing social networks instead of getting butchered by thousands of kids on an imageboard who prefer reposting frogs for over a decade
  thats the point shes supposed to be our perfect angel not some realistic trashy 3dpd

  loli derives from lolita i assume you are at least passively familiar with that story since you claim to be so knowledgeable on the the subject lolita is the nickname of the girl in the story given to her by her adult male lover the term is actually meant to imply a character is contextually underage and that is the case 99 of the time lolis are almost always underage little girls thats what attracts lolicons all the aspects of prepubescence represented by a 2d character thats why i call lolicons pedos because in order to be a pedo you merely need to be attracted to children there is no meaningful distinction between 2d and 3d theyre both children except one is real and the other is imaginary youre a pedo regardless of your preference
  hows reddit doing these days anon
  you are misremembering the /v/gas were in late 2011 pomfpomfpomf was early 2012
            didnt read lol
  developing your ethics from anime gags  lol the strong willed anime man stressed that its not sick therefore it must be true  the gag literally ends with a word of dismissal that you might hear from a loli forum because the writers wrote themselves in a corner and couldnt even answer the questions of their strawman female character
  actually the 2011 /v/gas released in february 2012 but pomfpomfpomf wasnt until march or april so whatever
  the /v/gas were in late 2011  pomfpomfpomf was early 2012    teaser uploaded early 2012    think it was the opposite pomfpomfpomf late 2011 /v/gas early 2012 i know /v/gas had to be reuploaded but i dont think the teaser had to be reupped as well the earliest video on the channel dates to mid dec 2011 where anon is recruiting helpers
  this makes the most sense to me thinking back on it it could be the case that i just didnt know about /v/ga awards since i frequented other boards than /v/ at the time so probably learned about it retroactively after being exposed to nyanners in the first place i dont recall her being posted much on /a/ before then though
  the earliest result ive found in google for pomfpomfpomf is march 14 2012 which was well after the /v/gas aired if you can find an earlier result go for it  never mind that the /v/gas were in production for months
  thats not nice they keep calling women roasties these guys are not very nice at all  collab with bury when
finally had a bit of freedom time  heres one of the linearts
  ill fix bits of it later
  on february 21st 2012 nyanners posted a parody of the 2011 japanese song ponponpon titled pomfpomfpomf shown below right in three years the video accumulated more than 21 million views and 12900 comments      2011 /v/gas dated feburary 13th    so the gap was smaller than i thought but thats how it is also going by dated google results and the trend data it seems like pomfpomfpomf didnt really blow up until 2014 which i guess is when it caught on outside of 4chan for some reason which would line up with her disowning it in 2015      i dont recall her being posted much on /a/ before then though  she definitely wasnt posted much since its not like it was on topic in the first place its only that one guy trying to claim she was hugely popular all along and got posted everywhere
alright if we are going to make her play games i think i found one that is perfect    cute  easy to have her contaminate over  not too challenging  underground enough to not make outsiders flock to her
  dsmiv  oh you japan the new standards are the dsmv and icd10al
  hes literaly reading the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders  and please not misuse greentext
  the manga started in 2010 and the anime didnt update it
  t roastie
  those holes  nice thanks for taking my hole joke seriously and implementing it in a nonretarded way it actually looks nice and tasteful
  nice thanks for posting this i run a youtube channel and will be stealing your idea punk be sure to check your subscription box within a week or two
  its only that one guy trying to claim she was hugely popular all along and got posted everywhere  i never said she was hugely popular but she was popular you or some other anon is trying their hardest to diminish the popularity she had before pomf using google trends we can see that even well before the /v/gas or the pomf video she was already receiving about 1/3 of her all time peak interest    which would line up with her disowning it in 2015  it also happens to line up with her coming of age you know maturing growing coming to the realization that perhaps being associated with pedos isnt a good thing
theyre still arguing about it  this is what autism looks like on the internet
  he says that the medical profession doesnt acknowledge the term lolicon so hes making up stuff about what being a lolicon means henceforth hes proposing that there should be a distinction where there is none
  coming to a 4chan thread to call people autists doesnt make you any better
  you are starting to look completely butthurt on the idea that someone claimed nyanners was no popular before and very fixated on the idea that anyone else that disagrees with you is a pedo
  i only called two people pedos that i know of with anonymity i cant be certain im talking to the same anons but i only directed my accusations at who i thought were two individuals one admitted he was a pedo one denied it and so i relented on the idea  they have also failed to prove that nyanners was not popular before pomf the more evidence their bring forth the more it becomes apparent that she had a following before the video  so who care what i look like im correct
  so hes making up stuff  hes quoting the dsmiv definitions about what paedophilia is  where there is none  there already is a distinction and thats that paedophilia is a defined mental illness focused on an exclusive or primary attraction to prepubescent children whereas both lolicon and shotacon are genderspecific terms that only refer to youthfullooking and not exclusively prepubescent characters remember that japan refers to hestia from danmachi as a loli
  he is still better than the 2 autists arguing for the last 14 hours
people still argue about this shit  loli and shota is a body type an idealized one at that
  it also happens to line up with her coming of age  more importantly it lines up with her joining tumblr and going full sjw which is something she later backed away from if posts ive seen from her in 2016 are any indication  maturing growing coming to the realization that perhaps being associated with pedos isnt a good thing  pretty sure no one is arguing that im just calling her a hypocrite for throwing everyone who was a fan of pomfpomfpomf under the bus when she herself was a huge lolicon      the more evidence their bring forth the more it becomes apparent that she had a following before the video  and it was a small following that you have yet to give any evidence to challenge
  no anon you dont understand if you are attracted to pic related you are literally a paedophile because all real children look exactly like fictional and highly stylised anime and video game characters that also have secondary sexual characteristics 90 of the time
why do people argue about lolis in a sticky about the vtuber
  because faggots keep bringing up nyanners in relation to this shit even though she never wants anything to do with 4chan again and nyanners identity is linked to lolis because of the content she used to make
                    lol pedohurt
just kiss already
  hes quoting the dsmiv definitions about what paedophilia is  i meant hes making stuff up about lolicon the pedophilia stuff might come from a real manuali havent read it but ill take you on your word but the stuff about lolicon is his own opinion    there already is a distinction and thats that paedophilia is a defined mental illness focused on an exclusive or primary attraction to prepubescent children  that is not part of the medical journal that is a mental gymnastic lolicons exercise in order to feel less bad about fapping to what are contextually children  remember that japan refers to hestia from danmachi as a loli  some children develop earlier than others you remember that girl from middle school who already had tits before everyone else
  lol pedohurt
  when i read your posts it looks like you are quick to give into assumptions of people and what they think and are quick on dismissing their opinions and nothing else will change your mind  nyanners was a pedo according to your definition and i hardly believe someone suddenly grows up and says now that im big and mature i absolutely dont like this fetish anymore unless it is convenient   she most probably still watches it and faps to it while saying she absolutely despises it in the face of the public worse because she says it was just peer pressure so it is obviously not her at fault when she was acting like a complete kiddiediddler in front of others  whatever is the case nyanners is shit an attention whore and you are butthurt
  but the stuff about lolicon is his own opinion  because it has no accepted definition  everything else  so basically you dont really care what anyone says or what words mean and you wont bother even maintaining a semblance of coherency in your insults you just want to call people paedophiles to feel better about yourself
ohayo    clovertan here it is so cool for you to watch me again presenting the wonder culture of 4chan today well look at a board that is very helpful it is the fitness board /fit/ dont let the name fool you though the primary purpose of the board is to help you get physically in shape but its also a selfimprovement board as they call it on /fit/ theres a lot of gainz you can get from browsing /fit/    first and foremost always read the sticky it has a lot of important information like types of fitness programs and nutrition programs you should follow in order to improve your physical fitness a lot of the questions you ask may very well be answered in one of the guides    lets dive into the world of /fit/    oh a nice muscular guy what a hottie he says his name is zyzz and were all going to make it awww thats so nice of him zyzz is so inspirational since he was once a smaller person who made it by focusing on his physical health we can all draw motivation from him    i think ill make a thread and ask for advice    hello clovertan here im looking to get leaner by losing more fat ive read the sticky but dont know how to go about it advice    looks like i already got a reply its a mean one telling me to show my breasts no im a modest girl yes im willing to lift but i cannot squat and deadlift heavy everyday no i am not from london what this about bread oh no the thread has devolved into arguing about bread hey guys pls give me advice and stop talking about bread umm i think im going to just hide this thread now    who is this huge guy rich piano does he seem too big i wonder how he got so big apparently his philosophy is taking 10 scoops at every serving well i dont know how much that is but its probably why he is so big if you want to get as big as him maybe following him would be the best suggestion
  heres an adorable guy name scooby he talks a lot about his natty gains by regular lifting daily cardio and eating a lots of vegetables one of his main points is if it tastes good spit it outits bad for you i dont know if i could go for that that seems really hard but hes giving everyone such useful advice like a nice uncle    whats this thread about manlet what exactly is a manlet awww thats mean short guys can be cute too but i wouldnt date one why does /fit/ have to be so insecure about their own height lol its pepe what no you guys make him mean also just like /r9k/ does to his friend wojack pepe should not be making fun of wojack for being short     oh look a thread for fat people called /fph/ this must be the thread all the overweight people must go in to get advice on their special circumstance lets see herehow mean its a thread making fun of fat people you have to feel sorry for them and their genetics lets go onto another thread    heres another thread about gyms to join planet fitness is one of the top gyms listed i always hear good things about planet fitness wait theyre making fun of it why they just want to treat their audience right /fit/ is getting to be really mean    that looks like all the time i have today catch you next time when we browse another board
  what does clover think about lolis
  thanks to the isp block i could not say earlier how cringe this post was  you almost fooled me with the yous it got but after reading it i realized it was shit
  im just calling her a hypocrite for throwing everyone who was a fan of pomfpomfpomf under the bus when she herself was a huge lolicon  she didnt target everyone who was a fan of the video she targeted lolicons she disagreed with lolicons she took the video down because of lolicons  lolicons arent everyone  everyone else was not a fan of the video because they were celebrating their lolicon fetish its just a silly meme song so why are you calling her out for hypocrisy when all she did was realize that maybe associating with pedos is a bad thing      and it was a small following that you have yet to give any evidence to challenge  i just posted google trends that shows she had 1/3 of her all time peak interest before the pomf video hit
  she targeted lolicons she disagreed with lolicons she took the video down because of lolicons  so why are you calling her out for hypocrisy  because she is a lolicon
  lol pedohurt
  because it has no accepted definition  but it does have a commonality a thread that weaves itself through majority of the content and thats prepubescence if you want to make an argument for legal loli then fine but not even that is completely right because the legal characters just act like children regardless of their stated age legal lolis are just another mental gymnastic    just a quick google search reveals that hestia is 47 so shes as tall as a child she wears her hair in a childlike fashion and what is her personality like i dont know never watched the show but as a gambling man i would bet on hestia acting like a child as well shes an oppai loli which means she has the tits coupled with childlike appeal
  but she posted loli art  the fact that you dont want to recognize it is different its like you have this holy image of nyanners and that she was always a pure maiden that hated lolicons when she was one herself
  but it does have a commonality  which isnt the same thing hence the difference you dumb shit  the legal characters just act like children regardless of their stated age  well this explains a lot youre actually a retard who cant distinguish between fiction and reality and think that actual children act like anime characters  she wears her hair in a childlike fashion  retard  shes an oppai loli  oppai lolis dont have the hips and generally feminine figure that she does
this is a thread about a clovers voice actors and scripts not about lolis start another thread and argue there
  they gotta keep going for the next 12 hours and get nowhere
  and i hardly believe someone suddenly grows up and says now that im big and mature i absolutely dont like this fetish anymore unless it is convenient  she got into lolicon when she was underage people do grow a lot between 15 and 21 but i imagine being a 15 year old girl with a voice like a 6 year old and an infantile sense of self identity you probably project yourself into the lolicon roll but when she got older she probably had mental shift not without aid of course im sure exposure to tumblr helped her along  this is all speculation though i cant really know what goes on in her mind however im painting what i feel is a realistic roadmap to change    to further speculate with a lot of girls how have that small voice theres the idea that they were someone molested or raped themselves as a child and so they suffer arrested development from the trauma the voice being an indicator of that it could be that she had an unhealthy view of relationships when she was still young but through time shes become more knowledgeable about how trauma has affected her and how shes perpetuating bad ideas  again just speculation only drawing that roadmap for you    theres also that study that suggests men have more locked in fetishes which they develop at a young age and carry with them throughout their life while women tend to be more fluid sexually often molding their own sexuality to their partners preferences or molding their sexuality to societys preference i hope youre not surprised at the idea of women following social trends this applies to sexuality as well when nyanners was on 4chan she likely followed her peers but then she moved to tumblr and got a new perspective and followed some of the group think there still is it not possible that she actually changed  just more speculation but still this is another route toward change that you havent considered
  this thread is just to make hype hiro is planning everything in the shadows
  was      posted  ah so past tense
    age  dont give her an inuniverse age if asked she either responds with when she was created or says its rude to ask this way people cant complain about her being too old or too young      again dodge the question when asked if she has a boyfriend she responds sarcastically    personality  naive and hypocritical frequently claims to have a positive trait while displaying the opposite gets flustered if anyone calls her out on it the audience should want to tease her    write her as a highfunctioning autistic whos trying too hard to seem normal
ive seen that people that wrote scripts for clover are sometimes making her openly aggressive  why not try making her lowkey agressive  so she acts all cute and moe while throwing sly comments that shit on people every now and then or completely falling into 4chan user mode for long periods when getting tired
  still is it not possible that she actually changed  that is possible but nyanners is saying that she never liked it and was just pressured into it not that she did like it and doesnt anymore also  speculating that nyanners was molested as you grasp for straws to support your bullshit  this is a comedy at this point
  people cant be judged for past actions  she is still shit you know    you are trying too hard to rationalize your idea so every action she made is justified and conveniently coincides with your view of her  havent you considered that all people are pieces of shit that hide their true self
i raped nyanners
  which isnt the same thing hence the difference you dumb shit  its the essence of what the word means without this commonality then the word loses all meaning    well this explains a lot youre actually a retard who cant distinguish between fiction and reality and think that actual children act like anime characters  fictional characters are just extensions of human behavior maybe exaggerated or subdued for effect but yeah when an anime girl acts all innocent and cute shes mimicking behavior that we associate with children     wears her hair in a childlike fashion  retard  oh right i forgot about all the adult women who wear their hair in twin ponytails thats a common style that women wear and not almost exclusively done for children    oppai lolis dont have the hips and generally feminine figure that she does  wew my friend i know youre not about to use the average to dismiss the existence of the exception
  are you a loli
  but yeah when an anime girl acts all innocent and cute shes mimicking behavior that we associate with children  so you think every legal loli character acts exactly the same so again youre retarded  i know youre not about to use the average to dismiss the existence of the exception  the exception being that the only thing loli about hestia is her height and youre grasping at straws to somehow claim that being attracted to her is paedophilia go back to kotaku
  nyanners is saying that she never liked it and was just pressured into it not that she did like it and doesnt anymore also  yes so this is only a problem for lolicons everyone else doesnt care that loliconspedos get thrown under the bus you should understand that someone wants to cover their ass and salvage their reputation as having your real name on the internet and being a pedo icon it kind of a problem socially would you rather she stand by her fellow pedos what good would that do her     that nyanners was molested as you grasp for straws to support your bullshit  this is a comedy at this point    
  would you rather she stand by her fellow pedos what good would that do her  i would rather she say that she did used to like it but doesnt anymore instead of lying  standing by the molestation angle when nyanners only used the loli voice because thats what was popular on 4chan and she always had more range than that and its not her natural voice anyway  dont reply to me again
   cant be judged for past actions  people can be judged for past actions but you dont hate her for being a pedo you hate her because shes no longer a pedo which is hilarious imagine having the gall to call someone shit because she stopped associating with pedos    you are trying too hard to rationalize your idea  its really not hard at all i simply had more knowledge to refer to so i didnt resort to base emotional rationalizations like hurr hypocrisy
  i see probably trying to fit it to a news format or a zoomer audience is a good reason for going fast but i realized i prefer a slower pace      incels are bitching in the vegan thread again goddamn just eat meat or dont what could they possibly have to say about this bullshit  long rant  oh geez  another long rant  okay this is a fucking insight i just had it doesnt matter if youre right if no one likes you you see this skelly bitch girl pretending shes some sort of nutritionist everyone hates her shes probably starving herself so she can get attention from her daddy she probably makes ten more cuts on her arm when she sees you chomp on a chicken leg yeah take a look at this  i eat meat and like it dont care about stupid politics  lol butthurt vegancucks itt  see not a single citation from like fucking harvard or mit about hotdog cancer because they have lives they dont fucking want a phd in being a bitchy vegan cunt fucking chad doesnt whine for hours about how you dont have onions with your alfalfa he pumps and dumps grass eating sluts and goes on with his life eating cheeseburgers and shooting neighbors over mattresses in the dumpster thats what really matters hey i think ill make a thread about that actually
  lel    i really want to believe but all of hiros posts point to the contrary  like he just lurks a bit in these threads and picks out some ideas that he likes
  so you think every legal loli character acts exactly the same  not all but most ive seen ive always allowed room for exceptions but are we really going to absolve all loli based on the 1 that just happens to not act like a child    the exception being that the only thing loli about hestia is her height   you never denied that hestia acts like a child  the sorceress is a literal impossibility but there are children with hestias height and body it happens
  thats just dumb for starters the boards that dont like anime posters sure wont like to be represented by an anime girl the whole vtuber concept is niche and foreign no matter if she speaks japanese or english
  you never denied that hestia acts like a child  it doesnt fucking matter because loli and paedophilia itself are defined by physical characteristics and not mental ones
  i would rather she say that she did used to like it but doesnt anymore instead of lying  why though if youre not a pedo then its no insult to you and regardless if youre a pedo or not denying association with pedos is perfectly acceptable behavior    nyanners only used the loli voice because thats what was popular on 4chan and she always had more range than that and its not her natural voice anyway  nyanners does have range but shes stated that her voice is naturally high she only emphasizes her naturally childlike voice shes even commented on how the lower voice she does is a strain on her hell everyone can do a high or low voice but the reason why nyanners voice is so appealing is for the fact that you cant tell that shes doing a voice it sounds natural she claims its natural and you have no reason to believe that isnt her real voice
  loli and paedophilia itself are defined by physical characteristics and not mental ones  well brain development is physical and personalities are just projections of ones brain development also hestia looks like a child
  if youre not a pedo then its no insult to you  you dont have to be a paedophile to call someone out for being a hypocrite you dipshit  denying association with pedos is perfectly acceptable behavior  no one is arguing that so you can feel free to stop making an argument of it at any time  is for the fact that you cant tell that shes doing a voice  except you can because she very obviously puts it on   and you have no reason to believe that isnt her real voice  i was friends with nyanners for 4 years so i actually have plenty of reason to believe it and plenty of reason to be appalled by your claims that she was molested so fuck off
  and plenty of reason to be appalled by your claims that she was molested  lol fuck off offendnorm
you are now aware that scenario writers purposefully use the word academy rather than school in school names so they can deny that their characters are of any age since academy doesnt mean anything
  high schools commonly refer to themselves as academies though and japanese media typically still ages the characters anyway
what the heck a pig in a party hat  hahah hello mister piggy eh ziggy piggy  save the pig the game the whole time youre saving the pigs life  haaaallppp
  you dont have to be a paedophile to call someone out for being a hypocrite you dipshit  its not hypocrisy to change anon it would be hypocrisy if she was still a lolicon when she made that statement  also why does it matter to you if shes a hypocrite youre painting it like it makes her a bad person but if you think that avoiding association with lolicons is ok then you should understand her reasons for acting hypocritically its justifiable    i was friends with nyanners for 4 years  ahhhh now were getting to the root of it a bitter old friend someone she cut out of her life perhaps hey were you that guy who uploaded all those group chats on youtube i still remember finding the dildo unboxing video it was an unlisted video getting linked around    so i actually have plenty of reason to believe it  i dont believe you if you were her friend then prove it post something only someone close to her would have  also post your real name and your address and where you work and then proclaim that you once enjoyed loli do all that and then you can act self righteous
  could work didnt pick up on that possibility because of hiros example script and bookmarks but that could fit her      oh no this poor robot on /r9k/ cant get a girlfriend ive never seen that before    it says hes scared to ask her out you should go ahead and be yourself    ah its not good to brush this off because of nihilism memes have joy in life seize the day    ouch its not nice to call op a beta incel but you know after 100 posts of him being too scared to talk to a girl i think there might be some truth to that you know    ddid you just seriously ask to pay her to fuck ahahahahaha you fucking idiot i hate this board oh hey let me express it in text  i wouldnt trust you to fuck your own asshole you creepy weirdo incel dipshit faggot whats wrong with you  but i love you guys my wonderful audience for sticking with this deluded little boy i promise my amazing viewers that theres a lot of good stuff on here just i have to look a bit harder right have faith in humanity dont imply the girl you like is a prostitute yeah
  but if you think that avoiding association with lolicons is ok  why do you keep jumping back to this when literally no one is saying it   someone she cut out of her life perhaps   the opposite actually i left after she got into social justice and became someone i didnt want to be around anymore that applied to a bunch of us  hey were you that guy who uploaded all those group chats on youtube  no thats the first ive heard of it though i can guess who it mightve been that did it thats a shit thing to do  if you were her friend then prove it post something only someone close to her would have  nice try but no im not going to leak our personal conversations to win an internet argument im not that petty and im not violating her privacy for your sake  also post your real name and your address and where you work  things that nyanners hasnt done you mean she got plenty of work offers back before she took down pomfpomfpomf by the way    this will be my last post in this thread
  why do you keep jumping back to this when literally no one is saying it  because its pertinent its the deciding factor that justifies her actions  if associating with pedos is ok then she has no reason to act hypocritically  if associating with pedos is not ok then she has a reason to act hypocritically  see if you agree that associating with pedos is not ok then it does you no good to call out her hypocrisy    the opposite actually  eh whatever its still the result of a perceived betrayal so youre someone who was close to herallegedly and now youre angry at her for not following your group think so youre calling her a hypocrite to anyone who will listen despite the fact that you think her hypocrisy is completely justified this is bordering on insanity obsessions certainly    im not going to leak our personal conversations to win an internet argument  i wouldnt believe some random chat text anyway you would need to show that you are at least within her circle like on a friends list or within a public chat as im certain you must have attended to one of her many streams and then after you gave me your online handle you need to verify its you by posting something related to this thread say you make a tweet or change your public profile to reference this conversation    things that nyanners hasnt done you mean  her real name address and place of work were all made public online hell she was posting images of her mom and their volunteer work or something along those lines i forget the particulars but she put her personal life out there to the point where it was no longer feasible to disguise her identity  when youre brave enough to disclose all that to the wilds of the internet and then proclaim your romantic history with lolicon then you have the right to be angry at her

                    lol pedohurt normalfag
your pedophiles  ill report this thread to fbi 
  you should go ahead and be yourself  be sure to show the butthurt from robots when she tells them to be themselves
2380936  ironic shitposting is still shitposting    even in an hiros threads
    make your own thread you fucking autistic faggots the project is already going at a slow enough pace without you little shits polluting it for an entire day going around in circles on an unrelated subject
  this project is going to burn out after one video two if lucky
  agreed they should all be castraded 
  not a valid reason to shit up the thread with your autistic offtopic arguing
  so optimistic     if we actually want a vtuber well have to do it ourselves no amount of shitposting and bad decisions by gookmoot are going to make this a success
  i am not even one of those posters      and we dont want a vtuber nobody asked for one    instead lets see if a campaign to drive gookmoot away can be done
  it isnt true but it could be not being attracted to girls between 13 and 18 years old is just as degenerate as sjw or lgbt and is pushed for the same reasons only a small number of mentally handicapped pedos harm children
  shillchans travelling
  and we dont want a vtuber nobody asked for one  and its hiros site hes the one paying the bill once you pay the actual server bills you can make the decisions    instead lets see if a campaign to drive gookmoot away can be done  instead you can fuck off to another site if you dont like this one there are other chans
  instead lets see if a campaign to drive gookmoot away can be done  good fuckin luck
  everything hiro does must be accepted and remain unquestioned for the rest of time u arent allowed to share your opinion he bought the site he can fuck it up however he wants wharglarabalbrbarllar ur cock tastes so good hiro  cringe
  realized i sound like maddox
  love his art
  he continues his autism  cringe
  to be honest playing with the easily baitable normalfag autist is far more entertaining than thinking of ways that hiro should make shekels through a virtual whore
  cringing hard at you right now
  all caps  hit you with this yikes
  it would be hypocrisy if she was still a lolicon when she made that statement  she is still a lolicon so its hyprocrisy
  prove it
could make her a spacedout rambling idiot channeling the spirit of a certain armless artistic autist    thats a nice thing to say a bit low on content i guess hmm the spiral reminds me of seashells like youre walking on seashells when the mermaid is angry you didnt give her her daily bath and that reminds me of that story where the kid was throwing starfish back into the ocean even though he thought he was making a difference he ended up making everything worse since starfish apparently need to stay on the beach to live or something but the point is that no matter how much you try somehow you wont end up making a difference anyway and thats why creative reaction images dont work because other people will just use those pictures to make threads that dont measure up not that it doesnt add a bit of culture just that it gives you that missed potential feeling not a good start and it looks like the first reply doesnt save it either something about americans always complaining about flags when really its better to assess a post on its content if an adult man is crying to his mother about losing a shiny pokemon on a train station are you going to make fun of him for being an american very strange possibly a nicer way to insult someone but still aimless not to mention that this is the first reply first post hasnt been best post in quite a while because theres a rush to be the first and you cant think and write something good if youre too quick also ruins the fun by delivering the punchline too early i suppose its better than delivering the punchline in the op if you have the punchline already delivered then youre trying to top it not giving a community effort it ruins the mood i think that was a rule in improv comedy ive seen enough bad improv to know that finding the good stuff isnt worth the effort
when making clovers script we should somehow mention how a pair of anons and a normalfag disscused all day about a completely unrelated exlolicon youtuber while she was being born
first video could have the vtuber commenting on posts in this thread yeah
  if an adult man is crying to his mother about losing a shiny pokemon on a train station  she should read this copypasta and seriously respond to it    hey /b/ i have a very serious problem im fucking crying because of how stupid i am    okay so my girlfriend was supposed to come over to my house today because i was going to go take her to a movie she lives about 20 minutes away and the movie we were supposed to see started at 415 which was in about 40 minutes i figured cool ill just play pokemon while i wait    so im playing pokemon and having a pretty damn good time anyway she finally does show up except shes crying as she walks into my room instead of doing the right thing by comforting her i halffocus on my game and her she starts telling me her cat died and just as she was getting into it i get into a random encounter in my game    a shiny pidgey holy shit for those of you who dont know/care shiny pokemon have less than a 1/1000 chance of appearing i stare into my screen in amazement yelling holy shit yes interrupting her midstory she sobs more and she starts to yell you dont even fucking care you just want to play your fucking game im still looking at my screen still focusing on catching my shiny pidgey when she walks over and tosses the game against the wall i run over and pick up my ds hoping that nothing has changed on screen and quickly noticed that she broke it my system and my shiny pidgey gone forever  i start screaming every obsenity i know and started flailing my arms around i didnt know she was behind me and appearantly i backhanded her in the face while i was being a dumbass and swinging my fists around she yells out fuck you and runs out of my house in tears    what have i done ive fucked up so badly and i need to know how to approach her i dont want a game of pokemon to be respoinsible for ruining my best relationship ever help me /b/
  remember to include the part about the normalfag blowing the two anon out
  except that didnt happen  have you been reading the thread
  yeah every point the anons made the normalfag countered until the anons ran out of arguments and stopped posting pretty basic btfo scenario
  no retard they got fed up of talking to you because you are like an autistic monkey that they got tired of playing with  hurr durr they stop replying that means they couldnt counter my arguments  no you repeat the same points until the other side is tired of arguing and believe youve won because of that  im not either of those two anons but i realized you were not worth talking with i might as well talk with the wall but at least the wall is justified in not having a brain to begin with
  because hiros vtuber isnt going anywhere and nothing will come of it maybe if there were developments
  i am pretty sure he sucked their dicks
  what are the arguments that i failed to address  why am i even asking youre just going to disappear like the other two
tfw i have underrage nyanners nudes that her ex bf leaked ages ago and cant share because its literally illegal     also she was into ageplay even during her tumblrina phase which was pretty funny wanted to be the uguu daddys little girl in bed with a pacifier while making big girl blog posts against pedos     to answer the question before it comes up  no her pussy isnt lolilike and she has some pretty meaty curtains
  stop trying to pick worthless fights with everyone you assmonkey and start talking about something relevant to the thread
to be honest i dont think a script written here will be too funny to be chosen by a lot of anons even if it ends up being massively liked writting the jokes and voicing them are different and wont come out fine all the time  try to transcript the jokes in the video to written format and youll see that they are not very funny that way the same applies to this i dont think we will get anywhere unless we do something more than throwing random scripts nobody will like  we could also see how comedy scripters/youtubers do their job on coming up with jokes not that this will be a tvshow but we could gather some insight on how to adapt it
  i bet she doesnt even have a fat loli cock
  i like this script
  being raped as a child makes a physical change to your vocal cords so theh stop development at puberty     wow really makes you think maybe i should have been raped as 4 year old so i could not have a man voice when i grow up oh wait it exclusively happens to females for some reason get your dr phil psuedomedic shit out of here
  i wouldnt have to correct people if they didnt say wrong things  ive contributed to the topic already and ill continue to do so if i have anymore to say about it
  whoa hold your horses are you saying that men and women respond differently to their experiences its almost like were two different i dont things
i know what we should do  we should oficially make clover a lolicon and write a script about her being a not so secret kiddie diddler  bonus point for getting a voice actress that impersonates nyanners when in pedomode
  oh right i forgot that sperm gets absorbed by the uterus of little girls and swim directly to the vocal cords where they implant theirselves and cause physical changes to its structure so that it doesnt develop during puberty but a little boys anus lacks that ability my bad
hiro this is more proof that this project would have been better if the loli was picked sorry toy rigged the polls maybe next time you give us the real winner and your project will make it past the 2nd phase before crashing and burning
holy shit get married already have nyanners be at your wedding
  and then have her be into her small bear loli sister yeah
  does she look like this  
  well actually there is a study that suggests women intaking sperm lowers their stress and headaches and generally improves their mood not necessarily that they have sex but that they actually receive the semen    hormones work in funny ways like for example did you know that talking to attractive women boosts your testosterone or that even interactions between two boys where one successfully asserts his will over the other will cause the winning boys testosterone to increase and the losers to decrease    experiences do shape us physically
  i like this idea so much that i just made this design for her in lolicon mode what do you guys think i think she should wear this outfit all the time xd
  yes
dont make scripts you fucking dumbasses all the content needs to come from the va just hire someone that browses this shithole and knows the memes thats all you need    of course even that is asking a lot
  who could ever fill such a role
  unironically just hire eilene and let him handle everything
  implying hiroshima will accept a nonenglish va
  moe/enkidu is murrican he can find more of those im pretty sure
  i dont think hiro wants to share his shekels but i unironically think he should try to collab with moe once this is set up
i just found out about this is there any info on applying to be the voice actor
  just post stuff in this thread and hiro might you you
  i know some people have a hard on when there is a cute japanese voice actress but honestly i think it is a bad decision  she should speak english since it is an english based site and there are enough people that like dubs i suposse  you better think this well hiro
  be at work  refresh  hiro gives you a you
  have another you
i know 4chan has long gone mainstream but officially appealing to it is certainly a new low i dont see how one can be entertained by regurgitated memes readymade for mass consumption checking ed was a step down from lurking more this in turn is akin to it going full ohinternet except this time it is us
  congratulations anon make sure to treasure it
  hey hiro if you want to proceed with having boards contribute their own scripts i think you should have a reviewer that tones down board influence so she does not come across as very different each time and can have a consistent behavior i think it should be tiered as    topic decided on  relevant boards propose either a script or a list of talking points she should bring up  scriptwriter makes these talking points into a coherent sequence  reviewer only cuts out extreme or specific stances that would be inconsistent with other boards for example she wouldnt refer to superhero content as capeshit because /co/ will likely have her endorse some superhero stuff  va performs the script or is free to improvise some parts as long as she addresses the talking points which will also be emphasized to her
  i will
  this copypasta better be read by her
  not really that hard i got a you from just editing the so cash copypasta
right i think i can do /po/  okay you uh losers im going to redpill you on this board its hardcore and scary and stuff um so its a place where people fold paper into flowers and animals and airplanes wwhich is totally uncool yuck a vtuber like me wouldnt be caught dead doing such boring things  woah they made a paper crane with arms and legs thats amazing i mean tryhard totally tryhard only kids would be entertained by paper cranes i learned that when i was ten and they told me i wasnt cool yeah look at this attempt completely 100 amateur you can see how the hands are slightly off ew i wouldnt give this to anyone to make them smile id do it to make them frown though its that bad  is that a wintercroft request sheesh why do people want low polygon masks so much i could whip one up in blender uh i mean id throw it in a blender for the fiber its important to get fiber too many people focus only on protein intake and they pay for it in the restroom but yeah even the losers here are annoyed by this kind of thread so i wouldnt ask for such a thing if i were you be cool like me and dont cause trouble for the website  did someone really make an asuka doll out of papermache wow thats weird and impressive at the same time like do you think hed do one for me probably not yeah he went all out with the design lifesize full body everything does someone have the diagram for it tto make fun of if someone made a model of me id um no id actually like one please im so lonely i hate myself and cant do anything with my hands  look how good this is and how pretty this papercraft model is i could never do this in a million years why is everyone so talented except for me its not fair i just wanted to show off my first crane but the meanies in the art club said it didnt count i hate my life i just want friends to love me  yeah so um thats why /po/ is a bad board and i am cool see you next episode virgins
lmao just do some tryhard bitch who spews memes and copypastas right and left
if youre looking for a voice could you find something that highly resembles terri dotys  finished watching interviews yesterday and found her voice very soothing playing the role of kyouko machi the dullahan its the sort of voice you can listen to without tiring of it and very easy on the ears
if hiro is going to pick the scripts then its gonna be shit and by pick i mean pretending to ask a board and then go with whatever he wants with the usual excuse not every single person agrees if pass users are going to pick the script its also gonna be shit cause there are too few they are not evenly distributed among boards and most of probably dont give a fuck anyway how is this not doomed to fail
  you know its true
  i can do that easy  
  so the maid from the doga kobo show
  sure i have a question about ligma
    i wanna eat out a loli ω
  do you know anything about sugma
  hey hiro can i have a you
  clearly what we need is a cohost  i suggest this tanned goddess
  a /fit/ poster is also a frogposter
  i like this
forgot to screenshot  ip change  lost a hiros you
  youll also need a face actor eventually for expression tracking hopefully the same as the va and maybe even an animator to touch things up      me too anon
  how are you surprised by this go to that board right now and tell me what you see
please for the love of god dont let her actually talk about 4chan in her videos you will be opening up an entirely new can of worms by doing that  just make her a cute vtuber that maybe makes some jokes alluding to 4chan memes but do not directly reference the site
  is your gf /fit/  picture is of a fit girl  what gym does /fit/ go to  picture is of a girl  is c25k a joke  picture is the trapmode aesthetics  am i gay if i go for this  tinder match w/ tranny  is hummus /fit/ approved  pic is hummus  /fast/ general  thread about fasting  kid had bday party no one showed up  can lifting save him  sex with black girl  first picture with pepe  tattoo thread  pic is connor mcgregor  stomach dissention thread  guy asking if he is screwed  qtddtot  questions that dont deserve their own thread  cum stack thread  has wojak focus more on supplements to increase cum load  jelquing  that one song thread    the only thing remotely frogposterish is the one thread with pepe as the op image
  please for the love of god dont let her actually talk about 4chan in her videos you will be opening up an entirely new can of worms by doing that        the can of worm spilled a long time ago
    jessi slaughter  consequences were never the same
    i dont know if these ones or this one   the first ones are cute but the latter one sounds more agressive which would make more sense with clovers apparent personality
why dont we just call her holechan
she should be a shyproud person the kind that would boast a lot but would shut up when she gets commented on unless you made her mad or something then she would go in an autistic rage and also she must do lots of /ss/ innuendo its only logical it is the best fetish after all
  
cute
p a t c h
best scenario 0/100 transparency  either way you have some good idea of what youre doing  worst scenario semitransparent  you really dont have a clue what youre doing  were living in the worst case scenario
  should we just make our own with blackjack and hookers
  the goal of this vtuber project is blatantly to advertise passes what would you even accomplish with something of your own
  fun
  he thinks he can run a youtube channel as a nonjap thats tantamount to just being a vrchat twitch streamer and consider it fun
  not him but call me what you want i suppose i maintain an attraction to more mature body types majority of my attraction in fact that and ive never found irl kids attractive still there has to be some truth in what you say
  lolita is the nickname of the girl in the story given to her by her adult male lover  her mom
  i only read vanilla stuff about love and consensual romance my favorites are rin mocchi and fatalpulse
    holy shit youre both fucking idiots shut up next time yeah
time to a new thread hiro senpai
this is going to be an absolute train wreck im almost glad bear loli didnt win because this virtual youtuber is just going to be one massive cringeworthy failure that everyone stop caring about after a single week
  vas and motion actor are always the same person when it comes to vtubers hirosamma    still say if you hire moe  ya get all those in one i mean some folks hate her but some folks are going to hate whoever you pick especially if you want an english speaking va in addition to having contact with eilene who is pimp to a dozen vtubers already with even more experience than kizuna ai
  seems someone made the model already perhaps the 4chan community can make its own vtuber
  the model is literally just koikatsu  but yeah being a corporate website promoter is going to be fucking awful it needs to be a trollish little shit to represent 4chan well and the winner is just too fucking safe and generic
  sadly itd be all of three seconds before a vtuber who actually represented 4chan would be demonitized    i mean itd be nice but seeing it from hiros perspective i suppose it is bad enough that the domain is on the fbis list of known pedophelia sites    still if a group of true 4chan fans wanted to make something that actually represented 4chan and werent in it for the money could happen though i suspect the va would end up being a tts bot
  i suspect the va would end up being a tts bot  could be a trap    hell should be a trap
  for the love of god anyone but moe
  as much as i love eilene the new moe is absolutely atrocious shes anything but entertaining lets not ruin the project even more before it even begins
  whats bad about her
  i like both moe is certainly a lot more entertaining than the few other english speaking vys we have so far or the women at least deat was alright
  shes way to lewd to be a mascot for 4chan  what the fuck dont we have yotsuba anyways
  tts bot  that is fine      fuck off faggot
  sadly itd be all of three seconds before a vtuber who actually represented 4chan would be demonitized      demonetizing can be lived with if you just want views or more clicks    trying to plan the content is the tricky part you could do a voicebank and make covers of /v/s songs and other stuff
  if you read the story youd know that delores was a cheeky little slut who was literally asking for it and fucked some random chad who managed to get a cunny threesome all summer before she hopped onto humerts pretentious little cock
so now that the dust had settled can we all agree this project will go nowhere
  i mean the way its written its clear she basically like a kid tried acting all grown up and got fucked for it literally even which even humbert realises in the end when he hears the kids playing after killing quilty so i wouldnt quite call her cheeky little slut who was asking for it because the whole point is she wasnt fully aware what she was asking for
am i missing something
  hiro is asleep
  yeah spaces
  look i agree with you traps are for fags but im talking about making a mascot for 4chan that honestly represents 4chan  best and the worst or at least the average the porn boards top three order in popularity from /lgbt/ /gif and /d/ pretty much any meme regarding traps can be traced back to 4chan    im not a lolicon either but unlike that asshole up the thread a bit i know what fucking domain i am on the one that literally invented pedobear and had a hundred lolis posted within its first thousand posts    and im not an antisemitic racist conspiratard diehard maga trump lover either but /pol/ is by far the most popular board and has pretty much infected every other board with its vitriol occasionally even   but maybe they just got lost    wait why am i here    anyways even i who does not partake in any of these things have to admit judging by the top boards if you want something that really represents the internet hate machine that is 4chan you want a gun toting racist video game addicted baneposting otaku lolitrap who desperately wants to be raped by aliens    and maybe does some origami on the side
  copyright
  the one that literally invented pedobear  he wasnt invented he was originally kumo who was not a pedo from 2chan that another anon brought over and it got associated with lolis by posting the two together something psychologists call conditioning
  too lewd to be a mascot for 4chan  do you have any idea where you are    short of onion linking this place is what bush jr was referring to when he said the deepest darkest dungeons of the internet shes not nearly lewd enough but as close as youre gonna get with a pg13 rating    but i suspect either hiro wants something he can monetize perhaps in an effort to rebrand 4chan into something more mainstream and openly appealing or maybe just maybe not even that sort of cold corporate greed but instead hes just a kind gentle soul who is entirely unaware of the true nature of the hate machine hes inherited      there is nothing new under the sun all invention is via synthesis
  or maybe just maybe not even that sort of cold corporate greed but instead hes just a kind gentle soul who is entirely unaware of the true nature of the hate machine hes inherited  haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahahaah
  i know i know but its a fun fantasy thatd make for a great sitcom
  take a gander     you really think hes spent any time reading the shit that gets spewed in this hellhole
  this faggot is clearly pretending i can see him now in his fucking room smugly chuckling about how many of us hes conned
  oh im not laughing at the idea hes unaware of what goes on the site im laughing at the idea hes a kind gentle soul hes a scammer and data seller massively in debt that acts like a yakuza and bought this site because it was similar to a site he already knew was massively popular and has the potential for a lot of money to be made the way he then tries to make the money from it with shit like this vtuber is what shows hes not that aware of the site itself    or put another way hes not innocent and hes certainly aware of the site just not of the communities in it
  so worst of both worlds then yeah sadly i could see that too    i want to have hope but as they say around here i know thats when 4chan will take the last bit of hope i didnt even know i had
  its ok to fuck kids if they ask for it
  theres literally nothing wrong if theyre preteens
  are you retarded he just pointed out what actually happened
    nabokov also really drives the point home how much of an unreliable narrator humbert is
  youre not wrong on the banner thing but in this case thats the joke
  its pronounced marine core not marine corpse  best voice though    she represents 4chan you should have regularly changing guest vas playing clover  good point
me the 800
  sadly itd be all of three seconds before a vtuber who actually represented 4chan would be demonitized    if you want something that really represents the internet hate machine that is 4chan you want a gun toting racist video game addicted baneposting otaku lolitrap who desperately wants to be raped by aliens  you see this is the problem we have when doing the script people want to actually make 4chan into a person but that would not work or at least it wont from a jew point of view if the intent is to get more outside people to buy passes she would be too disgusting or cringeworthy to watch  if we are going to write the personification of 4chan it would be better to just write it as a parody of it not taking itself seriously
  then again we have no idea how to make this shit work because we are just shooting in the dark and hiro wants an awesome script to magically appear out of an anons ass without any kind of guidance or idea of what we are trying to achieve   hiro what do you want to get by doing these are you trying to please the general population of anons in 4chan or some specific board is the target audience actually a bunch of normalfags who have no idea how 4chan works is this a way to get more money out of people  we need the answer to these question if we want to get anything out of this without crashing on the first try you cant just go picking stuff that you like and hoping that it somehow works we need a guide and who is our target audience
  this is perfect where the fuck is hiro
      fuck why dont we just make a oneoff parody using the bear  1 most everyone agrees hiro is a jew wed get to shit on this entire thing and say fuck you to hiro  2 it doesnt need to look good monetization isnt even a thing so it can actually represent 4chan  3 no one seriously wants to dedicate their life to this shit anyway make fun of it once and get on with their lives
hiro if you give me a you i will buy a 4chan pass
  i got a you without giving a cent to the site 
  whose cock is the keion craving in this scene
  you are not hiroyuki nagashami do not reply to my posts again
  hah a  sorry bro  if you write an epic monologue for his meme character maybe hell give you a you for bookmarking
  hes jealous hiro did not give him a you
  the same as all the others black
  good goy
  it had no bearing on what was said there was no need to point out that the child was asking for it
the truth is you love the hole
fuck niggers and fuck hiro fool me once shame on me fool me twice fuck you if you think people wont get mad at you for being lying jew then you are gravely mistaken
  idolshit
  did they give your lifetime 4chanpass at least yet
  which script do you like the most
  how could you possibly sustain this whole idea then i doubt youd find many decent crew members thatd do any of this without a stable financial plan
  nyanners is a wannabe gook who lied to her orbiters that she got abused by her parents scummy garbage tbf
  13  hes fine  if hes on /fit/ hes past the point of normalfaggotry for the most part
  what if we steal this idea before hiro has any chance to monetize it more than he already has
  we could  i mean is there any copyright on the design
  iirc according to the contest rules hiro owns the design now
i kept having lesser time each day
  did the artist sign it off    also when did that ever stop us
  cute
  give me a 4chan pass
  tfw you realize it was tits anon
fuck hiro and fuck passcucks
  use the better desing 
  why do we have to use the hillbilly bear loli  the only ones that like it are lolicons with bad taste
  what do you propose
  go away
  leave and never come back
  my idea was to let anons use the other discarded designs that didnt make it it seems like a waste to leave them be unused  maybe choose a different design for each board or make new contest for each board since 4chan is not one big happy family and nobody will ever accept the green haired bitch who won a rigged contest unanimously      the artist just did loli that dresses like a slut as to win the votes of every thirsty anon and you go and fall for it thanks moot the poll was rigged
  rude
hiro is a big gay
we could have had this as our girl    imagine
if /jp/ is to be believed the winners artist is the same one that made the lolibear
hiro why do you believe this will be profitable or even successful at all the majority of the users here dont care about a vtuber and especially not one with such a generic design the hardcore weebs that wouldve cared dont care anymore since you didnt go with the loli design and any non4chan users will not care unless its shilled/marketed to the extreme which would only cause extreme hate from the core userbase since we dont want a surge of new users     if you try and make her friendly to advertisers she wont appeal to the main userbase shell just be bland and most people would rather watch another already established /v/tuber i just cant see this being successful at all without pissing people off and even if it is successful some of the userbase may get so mad about her bringing in so many new users that theyll try to sabotage and ruin the project
  its an inherent misunderstanding hiro seems to have about 4chan  whereas he was able to market merchandise for 2ch and be moderately successful due to it just being part of a wider otaku subculture 4chan is a subculture its own right and whats more is its userbase regardless of board is extremely protective of it and hates any competing or more mainstream online subcultures and groups with a passion  the only kinda person willing to consume 4chan products in the first place would be someone already well familiar with the site and its communities and what hiro seems to be attempting to do here with the vtuber is cast a net that he believes will reach beyond that niche it wont   nobody asked for this and the ones that were okay with it were betrayed by the vote being voided to choose the most generic uncharacteristic anime girl now hes expecting some randos on /qa/ to cobble together some script and/or concepts   this already crashed and burned before production even began
  the best we could hope is for hiro to make her the new official mascot and for anons to draw porn of her  the vtuber is not a good option no matter how he deals with it i feel like its going to be a huge cringefest everyone will want to forget  actually any other alternative sounds better than a making her a vtuber even a slice of life manga that tells the story of an antisocial girl that browses 4chan and hates the world would be better than making her a vtuber
question which fourthree since nude loli is obviously one of them would have made it to the top 20 without the meme votes
hiro stopped replying he gave up
  or he got what he wanted and no longer needs to reply
  if the voice sounds cute then anons will watch it anyways because nothing matters when its cute cute is stronger than god itself
  we must outjew hiro  bags these designs too
  what a waste      look if there are no legal documents with signed shit theres nothing in our way
  weve known that for weeks they posted an image of both of them thanking people for liking the designs before the contest even ended
floeeeeeeeeeeeeens
  i want her bros
watching anons reee at hiros shenanigans is the most entertaining thing ever
  its funny how they dont support the site at all but wants the top say in everything that is done
  hmmmm gobble gobble nip dick yum yum
  bbbut muh sycophant  this is literally the best argument they can come up with
  well ive some idea what its like to suddenly find yourself in charge of a hateful online community that you know little about have little time to learn about but requires you do stuff to keep it afloat    i mean not as hateful as 4chan in this case im speaking of a game but well some small taste of that  kids blaming you for everything that goes wrong and hating every change you make not realizing its all required to keep their virtual playground afloat    so i feel some sympathy if thats indeed the sort of thing thats actually going on    but the idea that its that sorta situation does involve giving hiro some serious benefit of the doubt 4chan being the worst tends to assume the worst
  we literally have another community warning us even through a language barrier not to trust us we literally know he owes millions to japanese courts and sold data through clone websites why are you being like this
  i want to have hope but ive been on 4chan long enough that i should know better
  hiro i am also a current student at uca  can you tell me about what you did there and if you stayed at arkansas hall  why exactly did you choose to come here anyway theres a whole bunch of foreign exchange students
  reddit spacing  you have to go back
what is the point of this character why would you make such a generic character and then ask people for scripts based off nothing why does she have holes in her skirt
  he didnt make the character
  when an entire style of writing gets hijacked by a website  when other people actually let them do it
  back you go
    i think this meme is just an effort to prove theyve never been to reddit  as anyone who has knows its the land of the never ending paragraph in part because on a lot of boards you have to press shiftenter to make a proper line break    that said aside from the color scheming the winning vtuber would suit reddit much better than she would 4chan
itt sore losers whose drawing did not get picked and now they want to start their own 4chan vtuber because of it
  i doubt it everyone seemed pretty fine with it
  its easier to be okay when you namefag since you can virtue signal but under anonoymity its easier to be butthurt about it since the name cannot be traced back
  dont make me repeat myself a second time but please feel free to give me my free you on the way out
  this is the real winner i will never accept any other i will never watch hiros rigged fucking shitty money scheme
  i just dont know why youd assume its the people who had entries and not like the people who were nonstop bitching 24/7 about the removed loli and then about bear loli not winning doesnt make much sense for sore losers to be pushing the bear loli when the bear loli is also from the winner
  no ones gonna draw porn of her because shes not fun shes generic and boring
hiro knows fucking nothing about this website
english voice  fucking idiot jew
  sasugaaa hirosama
  not a matter of who made it  its a matter of what best represents 4chan no one gives a shit who won but what was selected
  that was my point anon
  oh but it wouldnt be for free whoever get in will receive a lifetime 4chan pass
why would i ever watch a virtual youtuber that doesnt bring absolutely anything new to the table shes just going to be an inferior english speaking version of every other generic anime girl out there i dont even fucking watch the moechannel ever since they replaced eilene with that terrible english abomination
  because it brings shekels to our beloved admin and makes his life easier as a result
  i would gladly have poured my money on bear loli posters/figurines/pillows since im a buyfag and im already a pass user    but i sure as fuck aint gonna spend a single dime on a girl that isnt cute and memorable
  lots of people pour money for generic girls posters/figurines from generic anime
is vtuber thing really the only way to go because this path doesnt seem to go anywhere and people are losing interest
  well in addition to the fact that they dont feel that they are this is kind of the equivalent of creating an anime mascot for the nra and choosing pic related over well just about any anime gun chick
  hiros path is filled with bad decisions
  its going to hell in a hand basket hiro has no fucking clue what hes doing
  tumblr lack of punctuation
  id like the ones which are suitable when youre going to sleep with
  did the original creator get his lifetime pass
  well look above he still draw for food supplies
  oh you mean turning her into one of those voice record in which a girl whispers stuff in your ears while you go to sleep sounds better than a vtube script
  but maplestory 2 is out hiro
she just needs to make a lot of smug faces
  that would be nice
hiro is a fucking idiot that knows literally nothing about past or present board culture  what a fucking surprise literally all this guy does is slap more ads on the site each month
what are your vtuber expectations fags
  the script is some cringy safe shit which no one cares about the va is some random thot that has never in her life seen 4chan and she puts in some retarded twitch persona because thats what the job sounds like
  2d like the nijisanji group  english voice actor using a crappy laptop mic  shiggy diggy memes and asking viewers to buy 4chan passes
  something like eilenes old skits except without the charm and not actually funny
  sell me on goypass
  whats with the robotic voice
  im not going to do it therefore everyone else wont  10/10 you obviously represent everyone
  i have a need to tongue and fuck her skirt holes
  that reminds me    is the jewish drawanon still lurking here
  who do you mean
  we should have a cute android girl instead
  i hope not
hot diggity damn this is gonna be awful
  it makes it cucked since you cant selfinsert which makes you an incel
is this supposed to be cringy garbage or is it just unintentionally terrible
  gtfo phone poster
fuck clover and fuck niggers
  dumb frogposter
  based
  just have each board make a script themselves
  your mom
  fucking boring
  christ at least employ a japanese voice actress  the last thing 4chan needs is some cancerous american voicing an official mascot
  american voice actor  kill yourself out of all the english accents americans have the worst
please delete the fucking awful twitter tier vtuber design and pick something that actually makes sense other than generic cute girl but with green hair
  based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    based    cringe
  british girls were never meant to play games and record themselves doing it it just sounds unnatural when an american girl is playing games you can easily imagine going back to the 90s when theyd play games in their house with their older brothers its just more natural sounding and homely
  i think you are just more accustomed to burgerspeach
i really hope this entire vtuber thing will fail fast enough before it does any real damage to a few good boards that are still worth visiting on this website
  kaguya luna is live right now and has 24500 viewers between showroom and youtube
hiro you should hire brap
herro i am hiros daughteru i just had my bat mitzvah  buy passu prease
  just became an adult and already trying to get the shekels hiro must be proud
  most of the world cant stand the sound of freedom
  only if voiced by lee
give up now you will give up later anyway do not use exploited labor for a doomed project
  seconding   its a classic
  just use tyrones voice
  upboated xd
seems like hiro already forgot
will she be dressed spookily tomorrow
  its cause hes been outed
  is he gay
  may as well be with how faggoty hes being
the project is dying in peoples mind  hiro you need to spark interest in people once again  almost nobody is here anymore
  hiro doesnt know what he is doing and posted this thread in hopes that someone would do it for him
  nobody asked for this its his project we are free labor just like jannies
if this project fails will hiro commit sudoku
  does he even know what that means
  jokes on him  my labor is infamous for subtracting value from the entity it is performed for
hes already forgotten about it
yall were too mean to him and scared him off    this is why we cant have nice things though it may also be why we dont really want nice things
  yall were too mean to him and scared him off  4chan  4chan is known as the internet hatemachine i doubt that he was scared off unless he was a complete pussy but even then he would stay since he is a big jew and needs his shekels
  well we aint ever getting our vp9 webm support now
  why
hey before we start making anime girls to shill passes with can /mu/ get audio on webms thanks
  no
                                            hi    why arent the boards purple for halloween  plsfix it bye
a recaptcha can be solved or not be solved it cannot be solved wrong    situation 1 there is a checkmark in the checkbox  situation 2 there is no checkmark in the checkbox    errormessage says its something in between which cant be see examples above
  holy mother of cringe
  hiro please reply to me
hito is a nigger dab on me if you agree
  /dab
  its a ploy to get people to buy passes  dont fall for their tricks
  bring back snacks too
  no way
based hiro trolling the newfigs
i cant believe i ever cared about this at all
  matey is on holiday with killing he made
  her face is 100 unremarkable with zero character as expected
  just like all the anime characters congratulations
  yeah what about this one though
  that is fanart of a video game character
welp we could say this project is dead  though i think hiro wont give up with this vtuber ploy and will come up with something we can all laugh of later
unsticky this mods hiro wont even notice
im clover here i dont like to introduce myself cause i hate the human being  cats shouldve taken over this plant not you guys  according to the contract i hereby announce that  what
  thats for you too come up with do you expect the incredibly busy hiro to think up the entire script
  thats a bullshit argument there are a ton of anime/gaming/manga characters that are recognizable even if drawn abstracted but this abomination has zero character a total failure of a design why because its not a design at all go back
is hiro dead
  one can only hope
  wheres your design
  another bullshit nonargument its time to go back and stay there
  wheres your design
  nonsense theres plenty of anime girls with unusual and expressive faces
  not that anon but he doesnt need a design to have a point or to have eyes and half a brain to even tell that she is bland  i mean even if he doesnt show shit he still has a point in that she is boring  if you can recognize a character by a silhouette then they have good design you can even tell that the loli bear made by the same artist and which i depise was given more effort to make her unique than the actual winner  now even if a character is bland they can be popular but it seems we will not go anywhere with this
hiroyuki  admin
  
unsticky this shit
  i notice its already been removed from the news scrawl so i suppose its about time we all pretend this didnt happen
im sorry for long away
  1stop pretending you dont speak perfect english  2whats the next step people are not writing scripts at all now
i wonder if that guy working on the image of all of them together is still alive
  nobody fucking cares about this shit anymore you faggot just drop it
  im pretty sure everyones gone by now  also checked
  what were you doing
  hmm what should we do now      i was always too busy in tokyo
  well whats the chosen script first
  you should add a board for east asian culture kpop cdrama and other things    watch this for inspiration 
  wrong youtube link heres the one with the virtual youtuber  
  hows moot doing these days
  make a page to submit voice clips google some local gook to make a 3d model    reminder the voice actor needs a good pc for face rig a good mic and decent camera
  good to see that brony shit still get banned while this  doesnt just to show how nobody is willing to ever allow it to be around again
  check out based kaguya luna
why not make every episode a different va    rewlly ruffle the feathers
  how about i put my dick long away up your tight asian boipucci
  back the fuck off
  can you make a discord server
  where the fuck were you at jesus hiro this was your idea
  apparently hiro doesnt have a smartphone that can handle 4chan
  fire all jannies and legalise sneedposting
  yes just dying from work and lack of free time i need some time off
  move the threads to /jp/ its not getting anywhere in the deserted mess that is /qa/
have you watched kaguya luna yet hiro
  check this livestream out when you have time      its about the state of western vtubers it gives a lot of insight about the current scene straight from the horses mouth too
  nice job proving my point
so hiro what variety japan can do for the 4chan vtuber  
    if the character designer of kumachan is in this thread can i ask why the lack of a fluffy tail    since kumacan has fluffy ears wouldnt it make sense to give her a tail    even teddy bear plushies have tails
  cant seem to find the dedicated vtuber thread on /a/ or /jp/ at the moment    but were glaring with baited breath over at 
are people seriously autisitcally whining about hiro not knowing what a stacy is im down to shit on hiro for other bad things but come the fuck on the guy runs two fucking websites and isnt even a westerner if youre going to talk shit and at least talk shit about something worthwhile you fucking eniggers
buttmad stacy lmao
  based and redpilled
  retard
  mandys fart problem
  konosuba trace  looks nothing like it you mongoloid aspie  this site will do fine without you fuck off to the real world where everyone hates you
  wasted 1000th post
  we
  put all this work in professional hands you need spend money to earn money
  that and a lot of passion    hiro if youre going in solely because itd serve as a source of income/revenue for the site youre not going to find much in the way of success with it no amount of help  free or otherwise  can tidy up poor leadership skills
huhu herro anon give sum tips prease and buy arr passu to surperrt clovahchan selling your data to third parties uhhhhh no no no uhh howdy haha  dumbrabbitpng  sell the site to someone who doesnt pretend not to know how to speak english to dodge questioning about shit hes done to his previous website before
  no proof btw btw btw
  no proof  our nip brothers have been telling us to be careful with hiro and it is common knowledge that he already has a lot of lawsuits back in japan  he is a master shitposter and does pretend to not understand the subject at hand to avoid problems when things go south
  stop believing his lies god damn it    lurk moar
  just get hanakana to voice her you shit
will this get dub in jap or just eng
  well considering hiro cant even get an idea for her personality he probably wont be able to hire an english va for free and probably same with japanese va  so to answer your question neither
  the idea of a vtuber is cringey and unnecessary so why the fuck not have a script to go with the cringe
  realizing loli is bad is full sjw  looks like she just grew up and out of the hivemind and you didnt
  underage loli isnt the only problem perverting things is wrong thats the fundamental aspect of it dont halfass it
so should we have the voice actors audition without certain scripts
  what do you mean without certain scripts which ones did you choose first
  i meant without preset scripts
  yeah lets do that
    good idea that way the voice actors write the character too
  how could this shit win
  highest votes of all nonvetod entries
  capitalism
  not this again
  with and without scripts characterization should be sculpted by multiple people including the person voicing them something inoffensive memorable and yet still unique avoid vulgarity its to be expected that the character will be bare bones at first but its essential to lay down essential framework before everything else starts how old are they what is their occupation what do they like are they a kind character who tries to understand and educate or are they dumb and aggravating start with the basics i wouldnt want to go very far past these details due to not wanting to complicate things but thats just me all in all id try to understand what makes other characters/mascots so popular mario and mickey mouse come to mind
  tldr just write a rough guide to know how to improvise the character
  yes itll be more interesting if the voice actresses improvise
this has literally become 3 or 4 people talking to hiro every few days
  welcome to /qa/
  hiro the mods are bullying me again do something about it
  dont worry he will continue to pretend to not know mods stalk users
  respond to this thread 
hiro only sees us as data and so does our 4chan vtuber
  on point
  do youll pay the winner with a pass  kek kek
this is the stupidest thing i have ever herd
  something inoffensive  avoid vulgarity  isnt it supposed to be a 4chan mascot not a reddit mascot
  he doesnt know
  a literal piece of shit with an anime of the season face won the contest  wew hiro you just proved that japs indeed have a shit taste
  what did you expect she is supossed to be normie bait so they come here and buy passes before realizing their mistake
  reddit is more edgy than soft faggy 4chan you just cant think in anything but reddit
                                                                                            learn speak engrish you yellow communist monkey
hiro pls remove rangeban on finnish mobile posters on /int/
wait just one second why am i getting a you for this
    whoops forgot to link the actual post
for a voice actor i would suggest this person 
i knew hiro was bad for 4chan but i never believed how bad till now what the fuck is this shit why the fuck are you doing this i assume it is some shitty scheme to get more money in your fucking pockets you cunt
im going to poo lads
hiro please unban furry so i stop getting banned from /pol/
  fuck you furfag

  hiro remove the ads in the middle of the threads youre only going to make everyone use adblocker and make you lose income from the site stop being retarded and get better ads if you want this site to stay alive
reply to hiro only with offtopic
thread goes nowhere  nobody even remembers this anymore because mods had the brilliant idea to kill any and all discussion about this project by deleting any threads that tried to generate even a remote interest in this    nice
   even remembers this anymore because mods had the brilliant idea to kill any and all discussion about this project by deleting any threads that tried to generate even a remote interest in this  based mods
  oh thats alright then
  i keep hoping to hear hes died
  the one that killed it was hiro by disappearing for so fucking long that the semiactive thread died
  pure gold
  i wish he responded to my soda question
  yo must be the same anon that posted all those reaction pics
rigged garbage
  female  riiiight sounds like a tranny or dyke
  incel
  hiro why did i get ip range banned while i slept i dont remember doing anything wrong on the last few months or this thread
  hi hiro
  hiro make a new trhed hiro    hiro    hiroo
  you never listened to actual women in your life right
  have the jannies do it lmfao
  you have money what the fuck
  hire a girl who has mastered all boards its not nearly as difficult as you think this isnt 2channel there are only a little more than 50 boards and only about 10 do you have to have intimate knowledge of even then this knowledge is pervasive in broader western internet culture anyway there is only so little she needs to know from each board just select an actress thats been on here for about 10 or so years and you will have no problems
  good god this script is awful  i wish you were a native speaker so you could understand how cringe this is
waaaaaaaait  hiro  why arent we doing a japanese va with english subtitles this would actually make us more comfortable and the quality will be far higher you also would be in less foreign territory as you can reach out to whoever  of course though spoilershe cant do it for free/spoiler    reply to this post if you agree to get hiros attention
    you sound fat
  based  also fuck hiro
  you should start by picking the personality like pic related so people can write about her and around her do polls or something if you want    i know that you are trying to do something professional here but you should try to do a pilot video or a prototype before with the cheapest app to see if this works something easy like clover answer questions or talking about herself
  i recognize that fuck shit and your little shit too    also rotten dicks
which service do we use for the voice actors audition
  the mod and janitor discord
  leave that to the voice actresses just have them upload their submission to whatever social media they prefer so you can easily link to it
  we could use /qa/ if you enabled sound for webms
  vocaroo
  hiro you need to make a new thread nobody cares about this one anymore
  listen to  it would let the actor show off a little animation too if they wanted or even allow people to submit their body models of the vtuber
  dunno how did you host the vtuber contest pictures you genius just make it mp3 files instead and make people who like to throw money on this site vote again
  not recognizing the shit was so cash copypasta  unless youre just shitposting in which case carry on
  hiro i cannot state enough you should use a japanese voice actor and have english subtitles all weebs would prefer this    english voice actress would be baaaad
  this this this this this
  but japanese people are banned from posting on 4chan
  hiro please enable visible sage again
  that would cost to much
  there are thousands of voice actors in japan without a job
  im talking about a translator on top of a va
  just make the same page like the art contest but embed soundcloud links    vacaroo still uses flash its shit
    make a new thread  ask to anons who they like  make a poll with who is possible to hire  voice actors have portfolio theres no need to send anything
this is still a thing
  during the 15 seconds/week that hiroshima dedicates to this thread yes
where is the drawing that anon was doing
imo the best personality for her is one that bridges between stupid and intelligent with a side of kek praising something that makes airheads think its stupid and take her words literally but wiser people to lean over their monitors and try to figure out what she is actually trying to explain behind the thick wording but for a number of people understand the reasoning behind her antics but act stupid also since she will be the representative for 4chan being dominant is important too   fucking thirsty damn who knows if the water im drinking originates from some chinese urine evaporated in the air and miraculously ended up in my mineral bottle but i would be gay to perform a cycle for you guys to continue it bless    i dont know what will be the content for it but ye waste your time reading my stupid suggestion with stupid content
  this
  see 
le bump
  dead  spoilerhe seems like a very busy anon/spoiler
  spoilers  bring back spoilers to qa though i prefer it this way feels more interesting
i dont remember /qa/ having a spoiler
ill spoil you rotten
  link
      please hiro do something the site is dying try to hold some polls something try to change the site for better
  let it due
  at least go ahead and kill off the fucking site then better than the current abomination its become
  no
  wrong it used to be good
  hiro needs to get rid of mods who stalk users and shitpost and troll them in very specific ways one made posts recently on /v/
  getting banned gave me persecution complex
  no its just that a lot of the time i point out bad moderation on /qa/ extremely specific rule violations pop up
  all rule violations are specific to a rule theres hundreds of bans per day you dont check them all everyday not all get displayed to begin with just the ones that fit the pattern you are looking for in order to reinforce the narrative you crafted yourself its like looking at the sky for a cloud that is following you
  boob and gamer gate threads reaching bump limit a thread started with zeldas ass and camel toe and something that specifically bothers me that is also violation of rules is posted in a thread a not long after i make a post on /qa/ stating my dissatisfaction i have spoken to mods in the past they know what my ip is and what bothers me they were also bothered by me they have banned me in the past for reporting this content despite the rules they did nothing then and it still continues i have little to no reason to trust they wouldnt try to troll me
  but hiro is japanese and does speak english  also there are a lot of aspiring and cheap vaw ho would take the job
  tfw do the exact opposite to a mod on /vg/ because he got butthurt over a denied friend request in a moba to the point he banned people pointing this out
  hey id like to buy a pass to pay for your next poll how can i do this you fucking gook  swine
  fag
is hiro expecting to come back one day and see we did everything he is askinghowtoplanondoing done
  the meme answer yes  the actual answer fucking yes
  to leave that to the voice actresses is better i thnk
  i meant i think
    hiro please enable visible sage
    you should do the voice hiro
    samefag
   but sage already is visible
  voice actress is best
  natural reader
  the hell are you talking about its not
  i mean not directly visible but you can figure out if a post saged the thread pretty quick if you arent retarded
  that doesnt mean anything being able to tell and obviously not in all cases is not as useful as it being explicitly displayed
  what do you want a little indicator on every post this is a dumb request for a useless feature
  thats literally what visible sage means faggot and you know it too  thanks for having this pointless discussion though drawing more attention to this topic means hiro is more likely to see it
  yikes
  its pointless  why does it matter  its against the rules to announce sages so why would you ask for the site to do it automatically  why do you want this why do you care if someone sages something
        hiro help me my brain cant process simple information please put it in big bold letters on my screen
im just here to say that shes pretty cute
          cringe
      hiro i know i am just an anonymous person on your board and my words and opinions carry no weight but please heed my advice    casting an english voice actor is a huge mistake it will be almost impossible for it to be appealing i cannot stress enough to make the voice actor japanese in this instance with english subtitles it will be more appealing 1000
      are you all acting like fucking morons on purpose or are you honesty so new that youre oblivious to the fact that 4chan used to have visible sage  i seriously hope youre just acting dumb to make a point but you sound like you think this is some totally novel idea rather than just a request to reinstate an old existing feature    if youre really that new then please fuck off from these kind of conversations and if youre just playing dumb then i think its even in your best interest to knock it off because youre not convincing anyone of anything that way you just sound really ignorant
  why do you care if someone sages a thread
hey faggots  my name is clover and i hate every single one of you all of you are boring retarded normalfags who spend every second of their day being productive members of society you are everything bad in the world honestly do any of you even have a waifu i mean i guess its fun making fun of people because of your own insecurities but you all take to a whole new level this is even worse than bullying some kid in middle school  dont be a stranger just hit me with your best shot im pretty much perfect i was winner of the 4chan vtuber competition and starter on hiros fap folder what hobbies do you have other than burn money on 3dpd whores i also get bump limit threads and have a banging hot voice actress she just blew hiro shit was so cash you are all faggots who should just kill yourselves thanks for listening  pic related its hiro and his bitch
  force your mods to stop stalking and tormenting users
  out of a sense of misplaced nostalgia probably asking to bring back visible sage among other things is akin to /b/tier bringbacksnacks newfaggotry but from /a/ people erroneously believe it gives them some sort of weebcredit or just like to parrot back something they read here like an npc whatever the case its cringeworthy seeing someone get riled up over it at this point in time
  stop shitposting
  muh olfags
  i dont and on top of that im not convinced moderation cares at all in a general sense and only deletes what they dont like they seem to be enjoying the fap threads that stay on /v/ while other garbage gets deleted
  moderation  fuck off redit
  as the anon who made the first post about this i have to say im really surprised you all are still fucking talking about it you know its offtopic right  are you really so new to 4chan that youre shocked theres people who want visible sage back theres always been people who wanted it back since moot made it hidden no surprise there  honestly just fucking ignore it the comment was directed at hiro anyway who as the former owner of 2channel im sure knows a hell of a lot more about sage than you newfags   included    there are good reasons for having visible sage but this is not the place to discuss it this is the last comment im going to make about it in this thread unless hiro wants to talk about it which he wont  the rest of you can suck my cock
va
  whos that
   he switched from democraft in republican in the kentucky congress under bevins governership   bevin incidentally has decided that all public universities need to switch to performancebased funding by 2020
is it okay for a new thread      voice actors wanted      she is really almost named clover    do you want to be a part of 4chan vtuber  please post your voice acting url
  how will you decide whos the best voice actor that way
  i dont know yet  questionnaires again
  questionnaires like in a strawpoll link and everyone vote or questionnaires like people who have the 4chan pass vote like we did for the design
hi hiro its my birthday today
  strawpoll can be abused so likely passfags
  あとどのぐらい
  just pay a professional yellow jew
  questionnaires again  its the only way to get an actual result instead of shitposts  please dont make clover too generic though  at least allow her call other people faggots
  to make shekels
hiro needs a diversion considering the site is getting targeted for harboring right wing criminals he needs the website to look moderate to not get in trouble with governments
  hiroshim00t decided that all waifus are shit so he set out to create the perfect waifu  however he is a busy gook and decided to crowdsource the waifucrafting which was clearly a mistake
  she should just have the voice of a man like bonita soleil or dr girlfriend
  we should just pay tyrone to voice her
  i heartily kekd
  so my english is okay
  so my english is okay    do you want to be a part of 4chan vtuber  that phrasing is awkward say    do you want to be the voice of 4chans vtuber
  no but were accustomed to it
  if you can understand main message of the feedback i left a minute ago you understand it well enough
  go fuck yourself subhuman jew and bomb ustars quarters with you on them while youre at it
i cant believe hiro only has enough energy to type out one or two posts per day low energy sad
  respond to this thread 
  enough energy to type out one or two posts per day low energy sad  he he works long and hard all day counting his shekels
  post benis and ill tell you
  kakkoi
    more accustomed because britfag chicks dont actually play games
  what happens to /f/ after 2020  save us hiroshimoot
  its already ded
  no we know damn well you can speak it fine stop pretending like you dont
     kek
  pretending
hirooooooo  
  how much of a faggot do you have to be to be unable to use kanji but still try to talk to someone in japanese
  t weeb
  ironic weeb
  top fukken kek
what about the 4channel vtuber
  hey hiro what about paid threads for ecelebs  you want to advertise your shitty youtube video/stream no problem buy a 50 100 or 200 thread pack and support the site its a winwin situation   you want to advertise yourself for free ban
this is some sort of breadandcircus strategy  distract the plebs with anime and then let the admins take their money and privileges
  get a japanese va
  you dont even use the site do you goddamn this is cringey
  i came really hard
  hey can you please add /pol/ to 4channel
am i still on time to submit my design
        voice actors wanted      her name is clover    do you want to apply to be 4chan vtubers voice actor  please post your voice acting url
  let me see it anon
  i like it
    i concur    now to develop the time machine
  to be fair we have a mascot for 4chan but not for 4channel yet
  this desu lol
  nice sticky buddy
  here you go im available for voice acting any time   
    hope you enjoy
  give me the job now hiroyuki   
    gibe job pls
tried to make a simple frontpage icon from an image someone posted in the second thread  
  it looks sorta like this proud of me senpai
  you sound like a pajeet goofy trying to imitate tyrone
      now this is a contest
    i bet if hiro actually browsed 4chan for more than 5 minutes a week this would be on the front page in an instant
    am female human please employ me hiroyukkun         breddy nice senpai
this should be 4channel mascot and 4chan should be a corrupted version with more skimpy clothes goth makeup and a nazi armband  they can be lesbians and yotsuba can be their daughter
  that hecca gay senpai
  very entertaining
who are the safe boards that are going to reddit v2
english  instead of superior nihongo    cringe and languagepilled
  sounds like trash desu
  ching chong nip nong xdd
  ew a girl
  best one so far
  well the voice is going to be a girl  isnt it
  tfw its actually going to be a trap
  you dont even need to crop things you can just edit the html to remove or add yous
wait a minute so whats the purpose of having a vtuber also what is a vtuber anyways
  money  a virtual youtuber
  this
    all wrong direction you need to not sound like moe kawaii anomu girl but sound like you are a chainsmoking girl that sounds gravelly and almost annoying      good effort chief
  ya make this the mascot and make her not even want to be associated with 4chan but totally forced into it against her will
  holy shit this
  imo bilingual vtuber at the least just dropping in the desu kawaii kinda stuff would be enjoyable a weeby way that reflects the soul of 4chan plenty of fags on the site who can at least pronounce jap right    how gravelly you talkin dawg like this or somethin  
  hole  lewd
  much better maybe a little bit more energy into it but its pretty much there
    did you post lewd audio on /soc/ your voice sounds almost familiar
  you never been on /fit/ have you
  what if kinda like this cute is important lol      nope have on /b/ and /r9k/ before lol
  suka
is this mascot for the new 4channel  looks dope dooood
  yup sounds great right there
  yayyyy glad you like dawg
  you have my vote
  tits or gtfo
  come back frend _
  damn legally obligated to listen to dubs  its a blueball board though so just take this  btw hope you liked the vocaroo vote4me if it ever comes to it )))
  the perfect femanon does not exi

  nice gyno fag
  fuck no dawg
          give the strap hiro im ready
  the perfect femanon doesnt exi
hiroyuki would you ever consider selling 4chan if you were offered the right price  how would one go about doing it if they were interested
  absolutely hilarious do it
  you definitely have my vote
wtf gookmoot
  whats up with the holes on the side of the skirt easy access for when i grope her cute ass how considerate
  please
  its not like we wanted a new mascot either guess thats something we will have in common
  kek
  something something traditional japanese clothes
where are teh vidoes
  hello
  f u
hiro you dumb nigger when are you bringing webp support
  jaany are you okay are you okay janny
  i sense cringe with a side of salt  my advice apply cold water to burnt area
/pol/ is the king of boards    everybody who hates /pol/ is a faggot
  based
/pol/ is unironically the crowning triumph of this website    king of boards undisputed
hiroshima you make me miss moot and in all my time here i seriously didnt believe that ill ever miss that fucking fag
/pol/ is the king of boards
  the normiest
  normiest  nice normalfagging there rdditor
  thanks d    the vtuber project is still in the planning phase faggot pay attention
  the vtuber project is still in the planning phase  at this rate itll be another year before there are any actual videos
  eh who knows not like you wont still be here right
hiro please just sell 4chan to someone else
whats the point of this contest anymore we are being split because this insectoid goook got too greedy again
hiro is bad at this
  i genuinely think that would represent the spirit of 4chan very well
tink tink tink  fuck hiro and fuck jannies
hiro are you going to make a /vy/ board
  based
  thanks
  fuck you
      this femanon should get the job very moe desu arigoto senpai
  oh based dubs arigatou ne  因みにあたしって 日本語ってちょっと喋ってできるんだし悪くないんでしょひろゆっくんha ha ha
  hey nigger can i have your autograph
  how do i edit a message on 4chan i meant to say ricenigger
  fucking gook two bombs were clearly not enough
  we want a japanese va you fucking gook
  no
i hate niggers
what the fuck is the plant you mean planet how do you fuck that up    how the fuck did a guy who cant even speak english become in charge of this website which prided itself in being a chan site in english and even states in the rules that speaking other languages outside of /int/ is not allowed
  oh but hiro does speak english competently hell just never admit it
why is so much time money and energy being put into this instead of keeping the site running smoothly   this is the definition of mismanagement moot made a mistake
  by buying it
does hiroyuki expect people to work for free last time i checked voice actors animators and even little things like the music you use in a video cost money not to mention youtube might not even host the damn thing given this sites reputation     this just seems like a huge waste of resources that can go into actually maintaining the website
  given this sites reputation  and now you know why the split is happening
  does hiroyuki expect people to work for free  well thats a safe assumption because the mods already do
  i dont think the split will fix anything even then he has to pay for two domains how does he expect to make his own 3d anime      but moderation is completely different than making a 3d anime waifu
  does hiroyuki expect people to work for free   you must be new here
  i understand janitors working for free but the idea that someone will make you an anime without pay seems like something out of a /v/ ideaguy thread
  time is time
  banning people is a much more passive activity than 3d modelling rigging editing video etc etc    think about it in terms of scope one thing can be done much easier than the other
  also anyone can moderate a site the other things i mentioned are more specialized skills and things people will expect compensation for especially if you do this for more than 1 video
  suck my nuts gook
    its not mods then think about our devs which also do it for free
vtubers  cringe and pinkpilled
  its a pr stunt thats working in tandem with the splitting of the site into 4channel and 4chan that will make this site more attractive to a larger audience and more likely to be advertised on
  fucking die gook
  fuck you you japjew kike this site will be much worse than it already is but who cares as long as you and your fag friends get money right i hope someone doxes you at the least or hunts you or whoever is above your position
  all gook insects need to be purged in the great reckoning fuck gook subhumans
do i have a chance  
  make /bant/ 4channel
    frankly just put everyboard but /pol/ and /r9k/ on 4channel
  ban phoneposting
  hiro please make a keep /pol/ on /pol/ rule every single time a discussion is going well and politics get involved they simply end up turning into a mess of thread with /pol/ memes being posted to the point of derail the whole thing if you want an example just go to /g/ and make a thread about any cpu/gpu being it intel/amd or nvidia itll soon turn into a /b/ like thread with no meaningful discussion
  if there was a way to do this it would be great  /mu/ has been tolerant of phoneposting for a few months and it blows me away  people like that just a year ago would get completely ignored or told to fuck off but now its accepted as a normal thing
  just reminding you that to advertising companies the existing content matters more than the rules if moderation doesnt reliably and consistently clean up porn bait lewds racism political trash of any kind and general garbage that demeans something on a fundamental level any website will be treated the same way 4chan has been
i dont think the split is going to work    its like if gabcom changed to gabycom then expected all the kikes in payment processing to just go hur de dur its a different site now ill take them off the blacklist    its a silly idea instead find a payment processor for the 4chan pass that isnt aligned with the banking cartels or push crypto
  gabcom  i had to google that  what the fuck
  delete /pol/
  this but with blacks and jews added
  end yourself
  will do
  dont
  i dont know why this was so fucking funny but it was
  would be cool if she could have a personality similar to akira kogami
  shitty
better clover make facist propaganda
  wow delete that
  she reminds me of aqua
  it is literally an aqua trace youre only noticing this now
  no one asked for this
  bullyable voice
  fuck you ramen nigger gook

  gamergate
    hi newfag redditors  get out before ill kill you all

so hiro is an actual fucking retard right like he has either has no capability or intention of learning how this website operates possibly both and is basically just in it for the money
  ouais cest ça
  fuck mods
    youre either a beta male cuck like the rest of us who happened to consume more onions than usual for that voice or a female    if the latter what are you doing here
  replace onions with onions dont know how that happened
    fuck off underage and/or newfag      take a closer look at your second link its just the wordfilter anyone can listen to it if they replace that word    god is this board full of fucking newfags or is it just this thread
  /qa/ is a mishmash of /jp/sies metafags /pol9k/ types and the people that stumble in here by accident
  oh duh im an idiot
  ofc u r

    samefag
      samefag
    samefag
          this is me
            indeed
disgusting 3d piggu get out immediately
fuck 3d is gross dude
  
  left  flawless  perfect  never ages  right  gross cellulite  sags over time  probably will bitch at some point
  where did you get this picture of me
  right  is real  can theoretically fuck in real life  left  is not real  will never be real  unhealthy escapism
  sstop
  is real  can theoretically fuck in real life  these arent positives
  escapism  unhealthy  why
  can theoretically fuck in real life  you cannot stick your dick in a photograph anon  unless you actually meet the people facetoface pictures of 3d woman are just as notreal as anything else
   idk if this person is already taken but e if can id smash idk im looking for a relationship soehhhhhhhhhhhhh
  because body pillow aint like the real deal but they keep me from being an impatient tryhard though when i crush i tend to get excited and give all of my hand too early
  huuuuaaahhgggggllglglglglllpppp
  i think that he meant that he can meet her and get to know her yknow unlike a fictional character
  t buttmad overweight roastie no man wants to touch
oh god jesus yes   i swear this whole thicc thing is the best trend to happen in a while seems like it will be a rather permanent trend too everyone just likes being fat and comfy and people are realizing giant fat butt and tiddies are better than flat and boring
  but he literally cant  the only places thats even sort of remotely possibly true are threads full of oc on /soc/
  this desu
  this isnt a new thing
  usa  30 obesity rate  this isnt even surprising desu it was only a matter of time
  trend  evolutionary human instinct to prefer the partner with thicker posteriors and larger breasts because of an indication of having enough food to last the harsh winters  flat and boring  wrong
  indication of having enough food to last the harsh winters  this has never been proven to be the case its merely a hypothesis besides if that were the case it fails to address cultures that lived in colder climates where larger breasts were not the norm which is the norm
  unhealthy escapism    the world is evil it has been the goal of almost every major religion since the beginning of time as well as philosophy and astronomy to get the fuck away from the world
  being fat is not comfy
this is literally fat its not thicc or whatever buzzword you use to justify being an hamplanet
  those are exaggerated proportions so you can feel them with your fingers when its too dark to see while fapping though
  hhhnnnnnnnggggg
  post more
  okay the only fapable is the first one the 2 and 4 are fucking disgusting
  can theoretically  theoretical is meaningless when probability is less than 000001
  soul vs soulless
  3d thicc women smell bad though to speak nothing of the cellulite and stretch marks just another reason why 2d is superior
  roastie couldnt emulate the thigh gap with her future cottage cheese
  its literally just amerifats giving up and lowering their standards and convincing themselves that fatties were actually attractive all along
i fucked a girl like this once    her butt was really smelly like  really  smelly  the sweat fumed ass cheeks went well with the summer    my penis went squish squish when it went in
meat and fat are different things
  tits are a match   right ass is too flat   right thighs are shit
how do we stop frogposting
your first step is to stop making threads acknowledging the fact that what theyre doing is effective and annoys you    too bad you cant delete posts on /qa/
  you dont this board was slated to become part of the glorious empire of kekistan by trumps second term and by kek we will make it so you weebtards have /jp/ to go back to or if you really need a random board s4s and /bant/ who both have enough cuckholdry to accept your faggotyass kind  kekistan forever
2473006  i unironically want to skullfuck you and cum all over your brain as your eyes are starting to drain from the lack of oxygen
i dont think frogposting is allowed on the spinoffs which you should go back to
you cannot get rid of frogposting you can only make it more interesting it by having frogposters adopt suwako as their queen
  do it anon do it so i can enrich you with superior kek genes
if you saw the /qa/ dog in the middle of the street looking hungry and lost what would you do
me as the bird
pet and take care of
  cute birdo
  what a nice birb
  ask it do you have a question
they want that baby then i say how was it
furry shit belongs on 
  i dont remember her boobs being that big
read carefully and indulge me please    mods on /soc/ literally ban the guy who proves the girl in question is underage            yetthey never ban the actual underage nude content    never despite reports
  breaking it down      1 guy literally posted the id identification card of the girl which proved that she is underage    2 mods were active in the thread    3 mods banned that guy and other guys who know know the girl and confirmed her underage status    4 mods did not and at no point delete or ban the girl in question or her nudes its all there
he doxed her you imbecile
  and she probably got away with it anyway
    5 there is another thread goingon right now with the exact same thing happening and mods already banned a friend for 30 days for just pointing out the boy is underage    pics related      yeah thats cool you mentally ill faggot subhuman doesnt explain why mods dont delete the underage nudes and still dont do when an underage boy posts right fucking now in the discord threadsor why they ban guys who point it out for 30 days
report the mods to the fbi
  pic related is happening in a discord thread on /soc/ right now
  and in the other thread people get mad over the fact that someone dared pointing out that women have ruined 4chan  lol
      okay you need to get the fuck out of /qa/ and i mean now you are the worst type of cancer ive seen in a while this is why 4chan cant have nice things
  who are the mods anyway
    take your meds and stop posting this thread is seruous go play fortnite or something
  beta orbiter defends underage girl he has the hots for  like clockwork
  i dont know and care about this i literally just want mods to ban childporn and underage posters at least after several reportsand instead of banning the people who point out they are underage/posting cp my ip probably gets banned for weeks any second now    thats all
  some discord kids
id is bannable because personal identification and can be mistaken for a raid you really shouldnt assume that means the mods evaluated their claims at all     there have also been cases where people ginned up fake underage ids to try to get people banned some anon posting an id is evidence but not proof     in any case if something isnt blatant daisys destruction tier it frequently takes time to sort out sometimes days its already well established what the correct thing to do if you see shit like that if you go off like barneyfag at the sight of a pink horse you should expect to eat banhammer      you wouldnt happen to be ban evading now would you      some say gods some say fags whatever they are they signed on to do nothing but delete the most autistic perversion on any site in the world this side of the dns divide
  both the girl and the boy have admitted they are 16/17    look at the pics     and literally 30 guys who know those people confirming they are underage should be sort of bordering on proof and enough evidence for a ban
literally 2 weeks away from 18  cp
    you should also make up your mind on the id either its fake so who cares in which case why delete and ban the guy or its real and she is really underage she is      yeah thats the law and her pics are old and she was 16 in them    and the boy who is posting as we speak is 16
  why delete and ban the guy  im this close to reporting you for ban evasion which is the only real crime thats been committed
  she has posted before  who knows how many years ago she started
          holy fucking shit calm the fuck down and read the fucking sticky if you want to talk to the moderators directly  mods dont read /qa/     go ban evade somewhere else and get out of /qa/
  yes this is the anime board
  weebs get out of /qa/
    im suspicious that anon is some leftypol raider trying to gin up evidence that 4chan doesnt delete cp properly anon went to the trouble of taking and annotating a screenshot instead of say linking to the active thread     one thing im damm sure of if 30 people actually used the proper channels with correct evidence as opposed to bitching in /soc/ and shit like  this     now i personally have a giant hateboner for camwhores and would have no problem escalating if i saw anything but i even went to the discord thread pictured directly and theres not a damm thing to report     all i found was a reminder of how much i hate discord and social media in general
further proves that the pedostalker mod needs to be reported to the fbi hiro
  in the thread she said did you miss me  bitching  yeah fuck off poltard
  read carefully and indulge me please  alright    mods on /soc/ literally ban the guy who proves the girl in question is underage  he could have proved it without dooxxing her    yetthey never ban the actual underage nude content  they already banned her and deleted some of her previous threads          mods are not familiar with all boards and even if they were you cant expect them to be able to follow what is going on in over 10k threads at any point in time thats why janitors exist but they are not always available     never despite reports  you know how to use archives so you know thats not the case you are being purposely misleading you can check a sample of underage bans for /soc/ on         as you can see to ban someone for being underage the person in question must admit it or look the part beyond doubt this is not the case        they are not going to conduct an inquiry each time you report a random girl who might be familiar to you but not to them they are not going to check the thread for her id or compare her pic to others to see if its really her theyll likely ignore it     a janitor familiar with the board might do that if hes around and itll take a while on the other hand if someone reports a post containing personal information about a random person on /soc/ theyll have you banned because they dont need to know anything more than what is in that post to realize it is breaking the rules    mods have to deal with cp posted on /b/ and other boards on a daily basis a 18yo minus 12 days camwhore showing her tits on /soc/ is not going to get top priority if thats what you are expecting     i believe this thread is not so much about mods not doing their job but about your personal issues with that girl how old are you anyway i bet you are a zoomer
  you are so angry right now that its interfering with your ability to communicate whats with the emotional investment anon
  id bet two strips of gold pressed latinum and a chocolate milk that its a rejected suitor
is it possible to meet women on /soc/
  i never go to /soc/ you are all braindead /b/tier reject newfag cancer board was created to free /b/ from those area code threads im only somewhat familiar with the board because theres is some danish schizo from /soc/ who used to post his mod conspiracy theories on /qa/ this will be your future in a few years if you keep making this threads take a good look at it 
  first time i agree with the weebspammer     get the fuck out op you piece of shit
  first ask this question would you really want to meet the female equivalent of some /b/tard     secondly yes theres some female males you can meet just keep in mind they tend to be surrounded by thousands of mentally ill /r9k/obots who will stab you in an attempt to catch some overspray of urea their beloved girlcock      i have no clue what youre trying to say here but thats ok this really isnt the right place for your concerns anyways      its a christmas miracle next thing you know well be getting fashion tips from barneyfag
  but why tho this would be like hooking up on craiglist
  imagine being a pedo
lol i just realized op is a girl i knew something was off
  normalfag scum are not welcome on this site so fuck off and die
12 days from being legal  okay this is epic
  imagine being a pedo apologist
what went wrong
  i dunno this thread is a mess
  this site  ftfy
textboards or imageboards
textboards of course
  textboards with images added but with none of the misfeatures like pruning threads at page 10 or boardlevel post numbering
  dont some textboards allow uploads but you can only paste a link to it or are you talking about imageboard style images
  dont some textboards allow uploads but you can only paste a link to it or are you talking about imageboard style images  ive seen both approaches and theyre both good
    im not allowed to post images anymore because gookmoot is a corrupt/incompetent retard so textboards i guess
  binaryboards
telegraph
why not bothgif
in my experience textboards are funnier i dont know if its the medium or the people attracted to it
  i agree  i think more effort goes into the posts though obviously still mostly very slight
textboards are bigger targets for spammers and thats why there will never be true textboards on 4chan again
  please explain  how are they a bigger target for spammers
  just look what happened to the old 4chan text boards and why moot removed them
  whats up with 2ch and yellow/red backgrounds
  its a futaba thing negroid
  shut  up
  noob question but are the textboards archived anywhere i didnt know about them until they announced they were being deleted and never got to enjoy them really
  noob question but are the textboards archived anywhere  yeah
  ah i see is this it 
  thats not why
  can you post any type of file
imageboards
  oh shit you found it     i meant to come back and tell you but i forgot i felt bad but i see you managed
  whats the funniest post you can remember from a textboard
  posts arent especially funny taken out of context i mean the general flow of discussions and the interaction is funnier imo   on most imageboards it feels like people think other posters are out to get them
did 4chan not have a textboard
  it did but moot shut them down  archives at 
i think i remember a textboard when i first got here  was there a 4chan text board in 2013/2014
textboards  imageboards
  so 4taba essentially
  jews
    4 years ago so yes the day they were deleted was the day 4chan died in my eyes or at least it was the day i lost all faith in moot    also regarding this sentence  rather than continue to neglect these sideprojects weve decided to retire them so that we can focus our time and energy into maintaining and improving the core of the site4chans image boards  originally moot used the word sunset as a verb and people called him out for using a dumb corporate buzzword so he changed it to retire old moot would have said axe
  thats one of them but not the only one
  what would the others be or are they too pure to be spoken of
  shii homosexual kopipe
  in terms of software emanon works as  described kareha in futaba mode is more imageboardlike with a variety of pruning options you can set a maximum number of threads posts or megabytes used or disable pruning entirely i dont know why so many imageboards and imageboard scripts opt for pruning based on a maximum number of threads its the option least related to resources and also the option that makes the wiping the board with a spam wave the easiest
  why
textboards have a place but i definitely enjoy images
/qa/  ive almost finished all routes in chaoschild and i have to say it was pretty good its definitely a lot similar to steinsgate but i dont think it had the same emotional impact of it the comedy scenes are pretty great at certain times you can activate a delusion trigger and briefly enter a well delusion and this is when a lot of the comedy of the vn happens like a character will reveal shes a chuuni villain or alien and its pretty absurd  i know understand the lyrics of super special a little bit more now but its a bit strange that it took so long for the vn to get translated im glad it did though  thanks for reading my blog friends   youre always super special /qa/
didnt read a word
would i like this if i like chaoshead
  same also very b8sed
  well its basically a sequel so yes
i liked chaoshead i guess ill guess ill check it out later
only liked chaoshead for the relatable protagonist and the super special ed
  sounds interesting
does /qa/ like kaos
yeah shes /qa/ approved
i cuddle with her every night
  cute
kaos is very special to us
  was he right
  apparently not
i couldnt get past episode 5 this pink haired bitch kept whining and crying to no end at least other characters were aware of how pathetic that looked and soon gave up on her
  i dont know who this is or where shes from
  keep /a/ trash on /a/ including yourself
  keep your mouth shut  how bout dat
  how has akarin been gone on any more adventures
  thats not akari daki guy the akari daki guy sadly cant drive anymore due to drinking and driving
  oh right he has akarin and megumin i forgot they were different people this is the guy who was talking about getting kaos a few months ago    hope akari wasnt in the car when he got pulled over she shouldnt be exposed to that
  no she wasnt it was just my dumb ass
  how you holding up i got a dui before and that shit fucked with me i still feel guilty about it
  im just worried about the fine my last court date is in 2 weeks hopefully i dont get any more jail time most of the guys in my family have had duis as well as a few people i work with so i dont really feel that bad about it other than not being able to drive and the fine what worries me is how high my bac was
  i watched maybe one or two episodes of that show and never continued is it a good show to watch to the end
  for my state im pretty sure the punishment was either 2 days in jail or no license for a year if you have a job and need to drive they put a tracker in your car to monitor where you travel as well as your speed
  i heard you need to pay a lot to get a tracker or one of those in car breathalyzers and i dont have the money for that shit i spent 3 nights in jail right after i got the dui and currently have my license suspended and probably wont get it back for a year or more even if i do get it back i dont know if i can drive anymore due to insurance prices i blew a 249 and my defendant is telling me that something that high might cause extra problems he also said it look bad for me since im part of the demograph that makes up the majority of dui cases
  literally who
    my first night in jail they cuffed both my legs and arms onto the bed because i was shit talking them and saying i was going to kill myself never tell the police you want to die
  yes
why isnt kaos on the front page _
kaos kaos i wanna kaos
  good question
  kaos is real
what do yo think about the other girls in the show
i like the images of her fucking anon
  sounds like the kind of thing /mlp/ would draw
  no
  go away kaos
i related to ruki the most
  be nice to kaos

were you a twink/feminine boy in high school were you bullied for it
i was mistaken for a girl once by a teacher and some people bullied me for it later that year i found a review on a teacher reviews website that said i was cute and nice but i dont know who wrote it
  post pics
  that could be very creepy from a certain point of view
no
  hot
this is the cancer that killed /qa/
  later that year i found a review on a teacher reviews website that said i was cute and nice  how old were you when that happened that could be cute or creepy depending on who wrote that review
  maybe 13 or 14 to be clear the website listed teachers and was open for students to anonymously review them it wasnt a website for teachers to review students
  thats creepy indeed why is it allowed for teachers review you anonymously isnt it better to do it personally
  nowadays they are the i want to fuck you target thots and stacies were displaced by them i highly doubt they get bullied or treated by others now
how do i find a cute bf
i started taking estrogen in high school 3
  i sometimes wore dresses at home but nobody at school knew i was bullied because i was small and skinny and young for my grade     then i had my growth spurt and got brawny and the dresses didnt fit and the bullies left me alone
i want to be a cute boys mommy gf
  post pics
i used to be confused for a girl from behind because i had beautiful girl hair 3    i cut it but its regrowing      very cute    very sad
/qa/ qt androgynous boys
tons of guys hit on me but im straight
  the thot fears the femenine boy
yes  no    even though my school was like half black people didnt really bother me
how come whenever i think about cute boys i feel all fluttery

/v/ looks like resetera right now
dumb frogposter
  if you cant beat em join em
  and thats a good thing
  go back to resetera
its over for /v/
  are you a time traveler
what even is resetera is it the new reddit bogeyman when you dont like what someone is posting
  apparently some time ago neogaf melted down due to nuclear autism and part of the community relocated to resetera and yes its the new bogeyman
  was that during the pedo moderator shit
yes the biggest impact it had on 4chan at the time was that moderators were playing hot potato between /v/ and /pol/ with threads regarding neogafs downfall until hiro stepped in a rare event which to my knowledge has not happened since then and publicly declared that they belonged on /v/
  no idea what that is but it must be all right if pepe posters dont like it
  its fucking unreadable now lmao
why do /v/ posters think they deserve anything but a mass lynching for being the absolute creativity black hole of 4chan/nel
  stupid frogposter 
  hows it feel to be replaced by people you hate frognigger  i hope all of resetera and their tumblr friends flood this place if it means you drown    t oldfag
imagine being a /pol/tard    no one respects you  all creative arts reject you  no women want to fuck you  you get triggered at anything that slightlychallenges your garbage tier values    imagine living that life    fucking sad yall
forced homosexual romances occur when the filmmakers insert one into their movie that has absolutely no relevance to the plot of the movie much in the same way of allfemale remakes such as ghostbusters oceans 8 and the new doctor who as well as colorblind casting of africanamericans and other ethnic minorities in movies such as the dark tower casino royale the 1997 version of cinderella and basically 50 of all superhero movies in the past ten years these are completely unnecessary changes or additions to the story and are only put there by the filmmaker to boost the progressive audience in fact most disliked homosexual romances come from films with alreadyestablished lore from books or previous films in a series it is perfectly okay for a movie to include homosexual romances if its either a completely original people derived directly from the mind of a studio or if the lore associated with the film included said homosexual romances including it for the sake of diversity of sexual identification by deviating from a canonically heterosexual relationship is both lazy and insincere  feel free to delete your meme whenever
  who cares its just video games and capeshit  grow up
  bbut who cares omg  that was easy
  no really who cares  why is this shit worth getting upset over  like i get this is a losing move in epic internet debates but why do you actually care about this so much
  you apparently
  you literally made a rant thread on the topic do you have zero selfawareness
  those arent exclusive to /pol/ especially this part  garbage tier values    most highly vocal people on this website have that as one of their defining traits
  rant  based illiteratebro
never been on /pol/ but im guessing theyre just normal people who have a healthy and natural in group preference regarding their race and sexuality like every other culture ever throughout history and youre a weirdo living in a quasispiritual fairytale nonsense world based on meaningless platitudes about love and tolerance that you follow blindly because the television told you to
  0/10 
looks like the /pol/ defence force has arrived lmao
  lmao  zoomer zoomer fly away  eat your tide pod floss all day  play your fortnite watch your netflix  hear tekashi take inmate dicks

since someone mentioned oneechan was being updated again i decided to reinstall it and enable my old css it got me wondering what everyone else on /qa/s been using lately so heres a thread for anyone to post their current css
changed mine quite a bit recently i should make a clean one but i dont browse that place that much anymore cba    looks like anime websites from the mid 2000 i miss that period dark colours and gothic lolis everywhere
anonymous always bullies me for using photon  i used stylechan for a while still with photon colors but got tired of it because it was buggy and semiregularly failed to load
  this looks really nice but arent the threads too small
ive tried doing this a couple times but it feels too strange so ive just reverted back immediately    ive always used futaba/burichan i didnt even like the yosubsa styles when they came in
  i dunno the thread is 800px wide half my screen i dont like reading long lines it looks a bit small when the browser is maximised but i rarely browse imageboards maximized
  thats a really nice theme can i get a copy please
  all the small little touches and attention to detail really make this css if i were to look at the rest of my browser in comparison to my css it doesnt fit nearly as well as what youve got set up maybe i should learn to not rely solely on oneechan and more on myself a bit to make a css
this is not mine i saw it on /g/ and thought it looked great so ill share it here
  thats funny i also have bernkastel as mascot for blue boards and ange for red ones however im not using oneechan since the code is rather simple thanks to 4chan x classes    
  ah im glad its not too complicated to get the mascots in ive been beginning to learn how to make my own css so that i can have complete control over how my css looks hopefull its not all too difficult to learn everything else needed for a css though if it is i guess thats only just a bit more time i need to spend learning
  honestly the hardest is knowing how everything is called because theres answers for everything once you search well from there it takes a bit of time but its easy
  does anybody have any orange themed css or just any pastel colored themes pretty much all the defaults suck shit
  slapped this together how does it look  
if you use flexbox layout in the thread watcher    watchedthreads    display flex   flexdirection column      you can use the order css property to rearrange the threads in it      for example  repliesread    order 1    to move threads without unread replies to the bottom
these are really cringy are you all 12 or something
  eyemeltingly orange do you live on the sun
  this one is really nice
been using this recently
  nice one although i might prefer her original sprites
  i have it cycles between sprites for me since i think she looks perfect with either sprite though the eyes are certainly better
  photon  russian bot detected
  i cleaned it a bit theres still some redundant stuff but it should work youll probably have to tweak the lineheight and some other things depending on your font its made to fit the one im using which is weirdly encoded

  you might need to host them somewhere yourself and i think they were added with a script not css
no rice no life
how do i change the color of the 4chanx header bar its annoyingly bright on my dark background and also oneechan is not an option
  divheaderbar  
i know this is not the filter thread but if anyone could explain how to filter posts that    type    like    this doublespacing every line for no fucking reason i would be very grateful
  try these  any doublespacing /n2/  only doublespacing /n2/
  i dont know what wizardry you cooked up but it seems to be working i am using the only double spacing option and its beautiful have a nice pic
same shit as always just with meiryo ui font these days
  a lot of people like it
what are some surprising or unusual uses youve found for custom css
i use this to hide the hidden threads button unless im hovering over the navigation link and hide the hidden threads count unless im hovering over the button i dont like being reminded of threads ive hidden    hiddenlabel    display none    rootcatalogmode navlinks  hover  hiddenlabel  rootcatalogmode navlinks  hiddenlabelhover    display inlineblock    hiddenlabelnothover  hiddencount    display none    hiddencount    float right    hiddencountbefore    content a0  
/adv/ is broken i tried all the 4chan boards but this is the only one that cant work properly without disabling ublock its also impossible to post anything i get the connection error while posting
oops
  use the ublock logger to figure out exactly what its blocking on /adv/ then go fix it
its something to do with the characters adv being used to tag advertisements i forget how you fix it though
/adv/ is fine its your shitty third party snowflake software thats broken
  use the ublock logger  where is that
    what do i do
  static filter org/adv/ found in easylist  ok lets see where i can go from here
  figure it out yourself i did it on my own so you should be able too
  what do i do with  4cdnorg/adv/imagexml
  the feedback page used to make note of that you have to add it to your whitelist and all that jazz
  i have this  in the whitelist but no change
install gentoo
damn /adv/ is a pretty fast board compared to the last time i saw it2015 i guess thats about the time all those frogposters came in
whens the next modern imageboard software coming out
when you make it of course
whats wrong with lynxchan meguca or dietchan
  what boards run on dietchan aside from the german one
lots of them already        what makes one modern anyway
  css templates
  none im aware of so far i mentioned it mostly as a joke because it fits the request of imageboard software written this year because most of the existing imageboards written in c virtually always a cgi program instead of a server process ended up as jokes or at least security hazards this ones pretty solid though its only missing a default stylesheet
  moderation tools are often overlooked but it seems like theres room for imporvement in that area like for instance i read here that 4chan doesnt have a good mobile mod interface thats something you need nowadays
  im really dubious on that last point do we really want to encourage people moderating boards from their phones mods already dont pay enough attention to what theyre deleting i can see that being able to delete spam or cp from a phone might be necessary though
  yes im mostly saying that for spam you cant really expect reactive moderation when theres one unpaid mod for 500 shitposters whos unavaible half the time
why would we need it when theres lynxchan
  does lynxchan have proper tripcodes yet
  modern in terms of looks its rather hard to improve the design without changing it entirely    id say most changes would be mostly ui rearrangements unless you wanna go full featuritis
probably never
  dont know why i wrote that  probably next week when some kid discovers obscure hipster language 5438  nobody will ever use it though
  always had
  the tripcodes arent compatible with other sites
do you need it

why doesnt my pass work on 4channel bros
  have you tried heeding the advice from the former sticky and also logged into your pass under 
because you bought a 4chan pass not a 4channel pass
why does my pass only work on 4channel  nothing is blocked like i said it works on 4channel
mfw im still phone posting after my home wifi got permab eight years ago   its fucking tiresome lads i was hoping the ban wouldnt apply to channel but it does
  he has the same ip after 8 years  what the fuck are you doing
poor dog _
looked like he was going to be thrown out of a plane _
its funny because in the first frame of the video it appears as if the dog is about to be thrown out of a plane into the open skies but in fact its just traces in the snow
  yes but i was also very glad to see that op is not so evil after all i was risking to make my evening even more grim while clicking this video but it was a pleasant experience in the end
wtf dont throw dogs out of planes
it even has a live leak water mark nice touch
  the /qa/ dog conquers the snow
  he didnt fly so good
how does one make an optical illusion
  or perhaps theyre wondering why someone would tell a dog that hes a good boy before throwing him out of a plane
  youre a good boy
  for human
post the last worksafe image you saved from any site  previous thread 
this is nick he eats shit and fucks his sister dont be nick
cute
  not cute
the last thing was the current /g/ aoc calendar can be seen here 
did females kill 4chan just like they do to every other male dominated pastime
no
  did females kill 4chan  no the question of who the culprit is can be answered respectively to the question of what exactly died
hey buddy i think youve got the wrong board /r9k/s 3 blocks up
  as differently as certain details could have gone down under different circumstances 4chan ultimately got killed by the sheer growth in numbers of human beings with an active online presence same as the rest of the internet
wait you can see the nipples after all the years i just noticed that you can see the nipples or is this a shop
  you could always see the nipples
  wwomyn ruin everything xdd  iim not a bitter misogist o  muh homeboard is /r9k/ owo  this is what you sound like a flaming retard  t male
  no get laid soon
how can you look at /r9k/ and still think men are any better
there are females on 4chan
  yikes  just look at this thread on /soc/ underage women showing their bodies to thirsty betas    /b/ is flooded with porn and women  tell me what did women do to make this site better if they havent done anything bad to this site
  underage women showing their bodies  what did women do to make this site better  you answered your own question
  cringe
  believing anons on the internet  double yikes /soc/ is a shit board anyway so complaining about women there is like complaining about someone peeing on your literal shit
it was a woman who forced moot to ban gamergate discussion and cause 4chans greatest fall women ruin all the fun
whatever happen to the no raiding rule /pol/ keeps on raiding outside sites and placing calls to raids and mods are doing nothing    lately they have been auditing twitter thots and have been using /pol/ as a place to organize and now they are trying to get happy haunukah listed as a hate term     4chan isnt a site for your epic troll campaigns and moot made certain of it those rules prevent this site from getting even more bad press then needed and newfags from joining    either enforce your rules or delete /pol/
lately they have been auditing twitter thots  mods have been deleting those threads the problem is /pol/ is so fast that the mods cant keep up
waaaaaaaaaah dddelet pole  fuck off redditspacer
did you pay your taxes op
its really strange what passes for a raid these days finding blatant fire and safety hazard in anarcho punk diy clubs flagging obvious tax cheats for irs whats next calling ballot stuffing of a soda naming contest a raid that bizzare capture the flag thing with the star trek guy     now im not particularly against deleting those threads because you dont need to let /pol/ know to let the irs know but you really need some chill jenkins some love and tolerance for people you disagree with can go a long way
  then enforce a auto ban if you use certain words
is there a better feeling
ban evading is a better feeling i imagine
  yes  mistakenly/unjustly banned  appeal ban  ban lifted  based mods
range ban because mobile uses dynamic ip  feels bad man
not banned  try to post  get this anyway
  are you french i have the same issue here
  buy pass goy
  rose are red  i hope you understand   you are not currently banned  from posting on 4chan
not having to play the shabbos goy by filling out captchas for free
when you get warned for calling out /pol/tards but mods actually purged /pol/ posters as well in the thread
  avant garde rhymes
  try to phonepost when out and about  ip is banned for posting child porn
  then stop shitposting via your phone
    clear browser history and restart phone works every time
  not him but im american and i have the same problem  luckily i brought a 4chan pass before 4chan shitted itself and can only accept bitcoin
  i bought a pass for that reason
  yes getting banned 1
  i had to go a year without posting on 4chan because some guy spammed with ips from my cheap as hell isp and i was too poor to switch for a reason like that  easily the most productive year of my life
  when you get banned for something that the rules are clearly okay with because some mod wants to use their power to enforce their personal views  and you appeal it  and after your appeal gets reviewed and accepted the board quality improves over the next few weeks with threads you like 404ing less
  not dodging rangebans  i do it all the time
  having your ban removed
  that happened to me too  i also got banned from /pol/ posting despite the fact i dont visit /pol/ because politics are boring to me
  saying nigger
got permabanned on 4chan  ban carried over to 4channel  i thought this place was advertiser friendly i certainly dont want to advertise here now
the 4channel switch means you can now shitpost using public wifi  feels good
  mistakenly banned  ban too short to appeal
log out of my pass before shitposting  devilish
site used to work fine  one day background regularly started turning white and images dont load  pic related  have to do a cloudflare browser integrity check or i basically cant do anything  this completely breaks 4chanx so i cant use it anymore  nobody else has this fucking problem so i cant find a fix
  oh shit  yeah this means i can shitpost from the bus again    sorry senpaitachi if youre in new york you better hope you get to those mta ips before i do
  i got permanently banned for posting cp appealed it told me to suck it up then like a month later when i was about to start banevading i tried to post again and it worked
  its bad but also good all you have to do its put your phone in airplane mode for 5 seconds and there you go you can shit on jannys again
get banned for saying mutt  of course i dodged it muttnitors and modmutts were seething
  true i remember i appealed my ban and bam my permaban was gone  i think i said something like i fucking hated bloodborne   a mod tired to flex i appealed back to posting in less than a day
you have been blocked from posting for 15 minutes
  you better not be on something retarded like a mac or you shouldnt have found your way here in the first place its an abnormality
keep getting banned for posts i didnt make on boards i dont use
mobile home work all range banned  ride bike 5 miles and sit in alley to shitpost off free wifi from restaurant
  doesnt want shitposters  treats posters like shit  you get what you give mods and jannies deserve all the vile they have to sift through
shitpost like mad but never get banned  maybe the mods enjoy my shitposts
lmao thats so true xd
  i got permabanned once for replying to a thread about salami once    i have no idea how bans work here at all
  windows i didnt change anything when it started happening same issue on any browser i try
  i remember i got banned for calling someone a nigger  funny enough the entire day before i made 2 cunny threads 1 hit 500 the other pruned/ delete by 40 bumps and im constantly the asshole who posts cropped porn  no ban  shut the fuck up nigger  3 day vacation
  4chan  what is that
  same maybe its because of the cute lolis i post sometimes
  chrome looks like something like a plugin is stopping the page from loading completely    mobile device whos browser doesnt run javascript by default
  yeah on the video games board faggot keep that shit in /int/ /pol/ or whatever    that aside i fucking hate the mods mentality of permanently banning from all boards for breaking a boardspecific rule every time i got banned for accidentally posting a nipslip on a sfw board its always a global ban fuck you mods ive got porn dumps to make on /d/ and /h/ whats the logic of banning me from a board whose purpose is exactly what got me banned on the other one
  luckily i brought a 4chan pass before 4chan shitted itself and can only accept bitcoin  shit whatd they do no way im gonna jump extra hoops and buying crypto
banned for frogposting in a frogthread    i wasnt the op just posted in the thread 3 days in the jannie hole darkest days of my life grew to resent them more    now i am an anti jannie extremist and my life is in shambles there is no going back now
  no youre banned for speaking some third world language
3 permabans and counting  pop these jannies like a silly nigga
  its a place of evil my fellow 4channeler dont look into it any further
  mistakenly banned  appeal  ban upgraded to longer and more boards
  this  you are banned from spamming/ flooding /sp/  what i dont use /sp/ nor speak spanish   you are banned for spamming/ flooding /lit/   who the fuck reads books anymore
  yes you fucking cowardly jew nigger    death to trannies death to zoe quinn    nuke mexico    gas the kikes race war now
  you can be banned for simply replying to shitpost threads even if you didnt create them  why
honestly surprised that my university is not banned
  understandable
  if you havent been rangebanned at least once you dont belong on 4channel
  t dummy
  were they based
is this the meta thread    bans have always been retarded
  i post cropped porn and sauce like its no ones business   banned for racism on an completely separate post  i dont understand this fucked up site
    t la luz extinguido
  that brief moment after the 15 minutes before you get banned  like the eye of the storm thats when i unleash the deadliest weapons in my shitposting arsenal
its get banned for gr 3 violation episode
that time some relentless shitposter got the entire uk rangebanned for 2 days
  post some
  i dont know man bans used to be fun
  getting a warning
reminds me of that time when i was banned 3 days for reporting a loli thread on /v/
  check your ublock filters i had the same problem because i used some /g/ filters like the retard i am and when i deleted them it started to work again    check other filters nothing that breaks your css
  they never make bans like that anymore  i mean they do but they never word it like that
  post a rustle pic of a girl tipping a fedora  it is not sexual at all 100 clothed and sfw  banned for loli 1 week
  i dont remember i think its around the time that canadian faggot ran over a bunch of people and blamed 4chan /r9k/
banned for starting a duel links thread before
  based mods
how did i not get banned for this 
  you deserved it
  is a 4chan and 4channel ban different now or is it a universal ban
  i got banned for replying to offtopic threads  banned for replying to video game related threads with porn in them  banned for serializing content  banned for posting  banned for using the wrong spoiler tags  banned for posting with a name  banned for pretty much everything except being banned for cp and porn i rarely get banned for nsfw content as its usually just deleted
  do not attack other users you may challenge others  what the fuck does that even mean
  mods confirmed based and redpilled
lol
  keep it civil   thats pretty fucking tame compared to most of /pol/
i got my post deleted on /a/ in a thread about new ideas for anime when i suggested an anime about a young nip girl dating an older black guy no ban not even a warning or explanation for why it was deleted i was starting to rack up some yous though before it was deleted
  yeah but most of /pol/ isnt lefty
someone is shitposting and deserves a ban  lets report this mofo  hello you have contacted 4chans ban report services if youd like to report for participating and instigating a flamewar please press the 1 key  if the post contains intentional spoilers please press the 2 key  if the post is not a safe image on a worksafe board please press the 3 key  if the post is offtopic or the user is underage please dial the 4 key while holding down    if the post contains trolling or racism outside of /b/ please dial the 5 key  if the post has furry guro lolikon shota porn outside of /b/ please press the 6 key  if the post contains a call to invasion or personal information please press the 7 key    if the post appears to be an automated spambot please press the 32 key combination  if the post is advertising or begging please dial keys 3 and 3     yeah never mind enjoy your shitposting and cancer mods i aint reporting shit
    wtf are they doing banning shitposts nooooooo stop having reasonable discussions instead of proving /pol/ wrong i will call them retards
  clear cookies  reset ip  feels goodjpg
  smug slurping
  wtf i love mods now
try to post from my phone  error posting you are banned  you are banned from all boards for flooding/spamming reminder that chara is pure and did nothing wrong angel of no mercyjpg  rangebanned a month later  thank you charafag you subhuman piece of shit
  surprisingly i dont have that problem much unless however i did get banned for replying to a post and saying its not that bad didnt even have an image
  be a redditor
  jannys cant ban people only submit ban requests to mods i once told that tomoko avatarfag that shes smelly and he or one of his discord bumbuddies reported me for avatarfagging and i couldnt post until a mod had reviewed it based mod didnt ban me though
got banned for 3 days for asking why smash threads dont adhere to the spam rule  sasuge mods  guess ill keep posting pepes then
  the issue is that that is tame as shit for /pol/ and no one anywhere gets banned on 4chan for saying fucking retard or being insulting its pretty clear the ban was due to breaking the hivemind
  accidentally pick the wrong option  get banned
how do i check if im banned or not
  i got banned for spam posting  except i wasnt home and it was my first post in 4 months  ttruck driver
  youre not
  how
  i only get banned when i upload itou shunji mangas
  tfw a actual mod rejects the appeal for your ban by a salty jannie and nothing happens
  bruh  look at these dudes
did something happen with the range ban thing acting up again or is this just a shitpost thread
  reminder that chara is pure and did absolutely nothing wrong  getting your isp rangebanned fills you with determination
i remember when you couldnt even browse the board when banned and id keep getting reused ips banned for cp or some shit i cant even recall when that changed but probably around the time visible sage was removed
  because you are keeping the shitpost thread alive  im not the one who started shitting on the floor officer i just participated i should be able to get away scotfree    user moderation is best moderation
its not fair  i have a static ip because i have fiber and im too stupid to know how to change it
  her tits are too big
  waitdo you think /sp/ is a spanish board  or are you just dabbing on us  either way is pretty funnysenpai
  he could be banned on other boards when i get a ban on /v/ i just go shitpost on /asp/ and /vr/
  not when the users are reddit scum
  checking the post your ip was banned for
  thats usually not how people end up choking on a dick
  dont do this it makes mustard gas
  permad for no reason  i think i found this one while trying to access the site via proxy
i hate rangeban are you
    hey fuck you pidor
hirohito moot successfully banned all phoneposters from the board    now get banned  get fucked
  based af
  gnutards btfo
  one of my favorites 
  im phoneposting right now
  or just use tor browser and restart it when you get banned  seriously 4chan bans are a joke
  sauce
  rangebanned the shitposters outside the us and canada ofc
  get fucked
posting in nyc on mobile  using tmobile 4g lte  almost every ip is rangebanned you only get a free one after 30 airplane mode toggles  eventually learn that if you go into normal 4g all the ips are free and clear  go on a shitposting spree for like 4 months  eventually overnight it becomes rangebanned  end of an era on the flip side i went back to 4glte after so long and its much less banned now even 4g normal isnt as banned though its still mostly rangebanned  it takes a bit of effort but i can still make my pony posts and trigger lee and my good morning /v/ posts even though those shouldnt be deleted since pripara is a video game
  arent literally all exit nodes banned
  same i work at a grocery store and the ban happened in 2015
anon makes a joke that gets dozens of yous  next thread make the same joke  banned  deserved it desu
  im in the uk though
posting fine all day  suddenly range ban  dont know if the site is fucked or its just me  i have a major isp in a major citytthey wouldnt just do that rright
  yes i tried it
  apm
  i got something like a 30 or 60 day ban for replying to a pizza thread on /v/ a long time ago
  you havent been able to post at all using tor in forever anon its automatically banned      what isp in what city
    appeal over irc  gets lifted immediately    fuck that one mod that bans people for posting on topic
  tfw faggot mods ranged banned all mobile ips around me  have to be a good boy now  cant even shitpost on my commute to work  kill me
  i got a 30 day ban for replying to a roll thread on /b/ when i was a wee newfag not but a month posting
  make what i think to be a funny joke  no replies  thread 404s   some days later see my joke made by some other anon  18 yous and counting
  absolutely based and repilled mods
post nothing  get banned  woooooooow
my mobile data is not banned in my country haha
    shit this scares me especially as someone who never makes shitpost threads but always dives head first into them bumping them
/v/ is actually scared of the jannys  pathetic
  in all seriousness i dont understand this it seems like they just look at the op to decide whether its a real thread or not this seems ridiculous because when youre just making a joke about something it usually turns into an actual discussion thread about that thing its very frustrating for a good thread to die midreply just because the op isnt an impassioned essaylength blog post    this place isnt reddit after all the initial post is just setting the topic rather than representing the whole thread
  this is my favorite
am i banned
  based
  can shitpost in any sticky on any other board and not get banned  get banned and have your post deleted almost instantly when you try to shitpost in a nintendo sticky

  nipples
        all these phone naggers getting banned  am i supposed to give a shit

  sonygros btfo
how the fuck do i change my ip if its static  please i dont know how to do anything tech related
like 8 years ago ms did something retarded forget what it was but i rightly shat on them for it got banned for 30 days for fanboyism
  fiber line  phone user   way to continue to prove that frogposters are fucking stupid
lol
reeeeee dont badmouth us goy
  delete system32
not sure if based or not
based and /qa/pilled
why do mods keep condemning threads to die on /qa/ddit when they could just delete it
do they even look at /qa/ forgot this place existed
i was going to share a topsecret tip with my /v/ros but now im not gonna
  my wife abby
  thank god for that censor bar otherwise i might think thats a vagina
  so that the /pol/ cancer can be properly curbstomped on its head like they deserve
the mod really just moved this thread and left the nsfw posts free including child porn
  scrawny and manletpilled
dear mods    please issue more public bans for stupid shit i believe it would improve morale greatly much more so than chasing pepes    t fedoraniggerfury5000
  its eurotimes
  most /a/ threads are like that
  is censored porn such as this allowed on 4channel
loli is legal on /qa/
  sure you cant tell what it is at all
please tell me how to change my fucking ip
never been to /qa/ ever since i heard it was created  look at the frontpage right now for the first time
  a guy posted in the last thread a picture on how to change your ip even if its static
  child porn   go back to redditplease
  child porn lmao
  where have you been there was a huge war between /qa/ also known as reddit/srs and /pol/ which led to the deletion of both boards and the creation of /s4s/
  i had to look for that stripped after you mentioned it
  child porn  never seen anything of the sort on /v/  maybe loli but nothing 3d
  its just pepes and and anime shit not much different from /v/ besides all threads only having 20 posts max
  i dont know what any of that means or how to do it  i need specific instructions for my router because i dont think its even possible
  newfaggot
              what is this  what is this  i thought this content wasnt allowed on 4channel  how am i supposed to advertise on the site now how am i supposed to feed my family    hirooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
  google your router on youtube and youll find how
  you must be a huge newfag and a casual then
  there was a huge war between /qa/ also known as reddit/srs and /pol/ which led to the deletion of both boards and the creation of /s4s/  i dont care or keep track of 4chan drama
  he doesnt know about the guy mentioning everyone  lol
dont mind me just posting some cp
  sly cooper thread  post a pic of carmelita fox  get banned for posting anthro
  is /qa/ still pls delete /pol/ the board
  what the fuck is the difference
  no is the delete 4chan one
  4chan bans the entire home network it doesnt exactly bans your pc it bans your connection to the internet the ip is in fact an identifier of the connection not of the device meaning everything from the router down
  buy
                aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa kill me im losing my money delete this immediately hiro
  so if i have a static ip im just fucked then  im tired of constantly changing up 4g to post every fucking time  i was nice in my appeals for fucks sake its not fucking fair
  same here i got permabanned on my ip with the pass because i was unfortunate enough to joke on a cp thread on /b/ i appealed two times trying to be nice and they were denied since then i constantly shitpost and i will stop only when ill die
  doesnt this work 
  i cant find any way to release the ip or apply a new mac  and according to this guy it doesnt even matter  
    okay i dont get it  what exactly was so bad about chara shitposting that made it rangeban worthy its not like it was offtopic in ut/dr threads or spammed so mercilessly it killed the threads à la barneyfag
  open wrt
  what does that mean
  i cant even change my fucking mac address only filtering them
test
  i have the same problem for 3 months already blocked on /pol/ /v/ /mlp/ and /g/ i can post there after few hours but once i reset my router then not anymore every other board is normal
  read dfw
  thats nothing last june i was bullying barneyfag on /s4s/ and was banned sitewide for a week for gr3 on /s4s/
  was bullying barneyfag on /s4s/  smdh tbqhwy famalam
  charafag is killing off phoneposters  wtf i love undertale now
  tfw mod gives you fourday ban  just long enough that i can appeal it  tell mod i was just joshin  ban lifted within an hour  its like they knew i was kidding and just wanted to see me make an appeal
   mod i was just joshin  you can fucking do that what were you even joshin about
  the mod thought i was inciting a crossboard raid i was just making an observation about how easy it is to derail threads on /v/ if you bring up politics the mod apparently believed that i wasnt really trying to start anything
  is there a better feeling    this happened over 2 years ago  anon requests some anime webm to be edited  do it  anon shows gratitude asks for variation  rinse and repeat 5 times  suspect anon has ocd or some shit but is always very polite and i have time anyway  come back 2 days later cant post before viewing a warning  mod thanks me for helping the community but warns me to not be exploited by anon in the future  apparently anon was a notorious shitposter and banevader using my webm edits to spam on some other board    was a pretty good feeling hey theres someone out there an actual human being who put 2 and 2 together instead of banning me for uploading files with the same hash values and enabling a spammer nice to know that some staffers actually care for the quality of boads and the community as a whole    thanks mods  mods  gods

/v/  hidden pony picture in op  nobody gives a shit  barneyfag arrives  thread goes to shit everyone laughs at barneyfag  post applejack is second best waifu without any picture attached to my post just to piss off lee  thread dies off  next day find out i was banned  okay although i technically didnt break r15 i got banned anyways not like i did not expect anyways if mods get butthurt to see someone talking about ponies in a barneyfag thread in which its already gone to shit and burning down thats fine by me  but what bothered me was the next thing  arrive a few minutes ago  go to /banned/ to see if i was banned  i was not banned  go to /diy/ to visit my frecuented threads  error youre banned    want to do a test post in /v/  post goes up just fine  want to make a thread  error youre banned    check again if i was banned  youre not banned  make yet another post on /v/  error youre banned    reboot internet connection  i can post again    given i have a wooden modem but that was really fucking stupid i honestly dont know what happened
  getting banned by mistake and having a friendly chat on irc while the mod unbans you
  banned for replying to offtopic garbage  ban doesnt even link a post so i can know what i was banned for  too short to appeal
  i think that was asan dude liked to leave messages to anons via the warn page    actually i wonder why that is not a feature instead of bypassing it as a warning just rename it and let the mods write encouraging messages
  duuuuuuude  tried to post from a train station and it said i was permabanned for posting cp on /tv/  looks like cunny poster lives in new york
  makes me glad i live in nebraska which is a very low populated state the odds of my state harboring frequent shitposters is slim so little chance for me to be rangebanned as a result of someone elses excessive shitposting
  
  cucking yourself to the will of some powertripping mod instead of ban evading like a man
  is there a better feeling  the warm touch of a caring partner    also orgasms
  the pleasure of being cummed inside
  is there a better feeling  yes being a phone poster and being the reason of a range ban that every other autistic fuck get angry because he cant le post on this forum
  based
  i like how you can tell people have autism from they way they post
  apm  whats that
reporting people nonstop getting people banned left and right while not being banned for doing so   targeting specific posters in generals and getting them banned
  lurk moar
reply to some butthurt anon calling me an underageb with a very obvious and lighthearted joke  actually get banned for that  thankfully contacting a mod on irc and swearing to him that i really wasnt six years old fixed it  i managed eight years without any bans until i started posting in a general with a very triggerhappy atmosphere all the offtopic/avatarfagging bans got tiring after a while though but at least it was a bit educational still not too keen on getting sitewide three day vacations so ive been much happier since i stopped posting there
  i dont get it
last bread archived thanks to spammers

why do they never draw noses on anime girls
  genetic failure  it must be you then since illya was designed to perfection
  she looks sick and pale  all attempts at breeding would most likely result in miscarriage or disabled offspring  she doesnt deserve to live
  they do though
  i guess thats what one would say if theyve never laid eyes on something outside of some mixed abomination
  youve laid eyes on anything outside of your cartoons
  you have ew gross glad im not in your camp then
  same
  better than sex almost
what does ilya sweat taste like
  attempts at breeding would most likely result in miscarriage or disabled offspring  doesnt hurt to try

how do you go about making friends online
if you have people you talk about shared interests with online id say theyre as good as friends
the closest thing to internet friends i ever had was a my guildies in a wotlk private server and they all left  rip warlords of dalaran  rip p a n d o r a
  i fear you need to use some sort of instant messaging service which seems like an insurmountable hurdle for me
you talk to someone and do stuff together
i want to have sex with someone i meet online
  theyre probably not the gender you thought they were
  u dont
  get a life
discord is the only thing thats resulted in friendships that feel equal to/superior to inperson friendships after twenty years of using the internet    
  not only is that wrong but disparaging to literally anyone thats used any other form of communication hate you goddamned discordnorms so fucking much
  i just shared an anecdote about my life your response is completely irrational calm down
  die die die die die die die die die die
at least bump the thread if you arent ashamed of your tantrum
of course the discordnorms bump threads without even saying anything of relevance to it  just die
  i also never understood how closest i was to having online friends was joining a discord server once but i was too shy to speak
  i want as many people as possible who are curious about ops question to see my earnest advice on the matter since i have experience in this area i might even make new friends in the process always great if you are actually interested in people making friends on the internet the way i am you should rejoice in threads like this one being on the front page    what is so offensive to you about people using a communication platform to interact with each other
  i made internet friends but i also didnt really believe sustainable friendships could be held over the internet so they all got mad at me and now ignore me and im sad
all the current efriends i have i made before 2010 i did find a group of people to play csgo with but theyre like 10 years younger than me and i dont play with them anymore its just been luck every time really
  take care not to trip over that ego of yours
i never tried making online friends because im scared of people online being too clingy or wanting to speak 24/7 while most of my time on the computer is spent watching anime or reading manga   i feel like i would be nice to have someone to talk to online from time to time but im not sure if im willing to put in the effort since i would be scared of hurting the other person over perceived ghosting or something like that
  voice chat is what makes the difference ive never been able to maintain friendships that truly feel real until i started watching anime/movies and playing games with people in voice chat now ive got people all around the world who i can rely on they can rely on me too some of the closest friends ive ever had i couldnt even tell you why exactly there is such a big difference but its there
  i feel confident answering questions about making friends on the internet because ive made many just like a carpenter feels confident about cutting wood if discussing a topic i know a lot about gives me a big ego thats fine
  thats nice i never used voice chat because im not a native english speaker and i was too scared of not being properly understood  im think im too much of an anxious mess to properly have friends
  people dont really care what you sound like they might poke fun at you for a bit if you really do sound hilarious but that passes one of my best friends is a guy with a heavy rural scottish accent
  theres also a guy from the balkans whos shy about his voice he comes on sometimes i think he sounds awesome like a vampire you never know people might think your accent is cool
  join a steam group or discord or irc or whatever you guys use these days  say hey crazy daddyos who wants to party with yours truly and dont let go of anyone who goes with you but dont seem desperate about it either    and dont spew your whiny depression bullshit at people online or youll lose those friends too because no one wants to deal with that soap opera shit
my friend anonymous is the best friend anyone could ask for he isnt needy never cares if im being quiet or not will talk to me about anything and has the consideration to tell me whether or not im being an idiot  i love anonymous
    thats nice to hear thank you anon i might try again some other day
  this i added a couple people from s4s to play bideo games with and one of them kept trying to talk to me and i felt bad because i just wanted to be left along
  thats why i like the /qa/ chats you can just idle and be left alone for the most part
  what if im too lazy/stupid to use irc
  then just be friends with anonymous on /qa/ itself not like the chats are a necessity
  steam or discord
  i guess but the last time i had fun on /qa/ i got banned  i just want cuteposting orbiters
been playing mmos for like 15 years now and still friendless wtf qa
  well just keep up with /qa/ and therell be a solution to that soon enough
  and dont spew your whiny depression bullshit at people online or youll lose those friends too because no one wants to deal with that soap opera shit  this
  dude your friends keeps calling me names
  my friend anonymous is also a big huge tard jerk that tells me to die for the slightest infraction against them and is a piece of shit that always tries to stop stop my discussions  fuck anonymous
  anonymous is a bit of a schizo but hes still quite alright

first for damage control   stupid weebos
  please use sage
gridman op really does get better every time i listen to it

  are you watching anima yell ive been wondering how it compares to those two dunno if i should pick it up
i meant the person above not her
thats fine then
im not  i might try it but it doesnt seem that interesting to me
its dogakabo like uzamaid but in my opinion seems more like their bteam still good though
the russian girl maid anime is too fetishistic
dust in the wind
anima yell is cute
such is life on the plains of /qa/nsas
still gotta get to watching irozuku
bought a shitty mini pc  gonna put emby on it
anima yell sucks
i had to save an entire board culture after only posting on it for half a year freaked me out that fate chose a newfag like me but everythings okay now so i guess fate knows best
it wasnt /qa/ a board that depended on generals that people kept shitting up
command and conquer generals was shit though  dont blame some random board for the devs failure

we really need a /kpop/
  instead of /kpop/ you should ask for an east asian board and then make up a bunch of excuses about how manha dramas and other asian culture gets pushed aside and an east asian board could collect all the kpop stuff too

scrubbed my feet with pumice theyre feeling good
started using oneechan  feels like im browsing the /qa/ with a qt at my side
post her
also gonna soften my feet but i have a device thing for it
just realized the one error that kept me from using oneechan again is apparently exclusive to 4chan and 4channels unaffected  hmm
im just using stock mascots so far but ill try to rustle up some /qa/appropriate ones tomorrow  this is fun i dont know why i didnt use this earlier
dont have any rocks to rub on my feet but i scrubbed my legs with a exfoliating glove
scrubbed myu feet with piese of concrete
had a big bowl of neetballs
been fighting on and off with my only female friend and considering actually trying to change something
what were you fighting about
done being stressed now i can finally sleep
oneechan is slow as fuck
my brain feels kind of damaged already with only /bant/ s4s and /r9k/ left to browse at work
anyone know the name of the isekai with beast lolis in heat that fight with big metal gloves i forgot its name i drew fox loli for reference
sounds vaguely familiar /wsr/ would probably know
were fighting cause shes a depressed anxious mess and i keep saying painful truths in the worst ways possible

so bored and i literally cant find a game to play  ive spent the past few days just refreshing pages
play cavestory or lamulana
i asked for a specific christmas gift from an online store that only had one left in stock and my mom somehow managed to screw up buying it and its since sold out she messaged me today and was confused as to why she didnt get a confirmation email and i found out that she hadnt purcahsed it successfully  when she got home and i tried to mention it she started shouting and swearing at my and said i was in a dark mood and i should stop being miserable over something so sillynow i just want to cry and sleep
took a shower  also its spelled atarashii

bought a new ssd online but now i have to actually set it up
stayed up too late again  better snooze
woke up too early today  better snooze
any /qa/s playing artifact  im looking at buying it and it seems to have a pretty big emphasis on strategy unlike other digital card games
whats a survivio clan
artifact is so dumb  why would you pay 20bucks for a card game that will immediately force you to buy even more microtransactions to get any cards  theres no way at all to get more cards than the base set without paying i wouldnt even play a game with a model that bad if it was f2p
yeah but physical tcgs run under the same model as artifact and buying artifact gives you free starter decks and some booster packs much like buying starter decks in magic or similar    id like to play skyrim again but i dont have the energy to go and find all the mods that i want then install them and make sure they work with each other on top of figuring out what the implications of that new version of it are  i havent played since before it came out
physical tcgs are terrible for the same reason  its a shame because magic and warhammer seem pretty cool but theyre also big fat money holes
i want to figure out how to set up a /qa/ spinoff but im dumb  it could be a new site or a subboard on an existing site but id prefer the former if anyone was willing to do it ive brought this up in the irc too  theres been some severe posting restrictions placed with the 4channel change and its making posting really really really really really annoying for me and some other people
accidentally threw my coat on sleeping cat and she freaked out
i hope you apologized and told her you love her
yes shes sitting on my lap now
  at this point in the internet theres plenty of abandoned boards to colonize hell even ones ive found with no posts in 7 years   although lots of dead ones get colonized by nomadic peds    if you really want to mod it though tiny board is really easy to set up or 8board which is essentially ribbitimageboard hybrid  also we already have the best spinoff ever at qasubreddit
    as ive talked to people in irc spinoff is the wrong word  going to work with others and see if there can be a board ran in parallel for now and eventually be migrated to in the future
yeah /qa/ spinoff sounds dumb as hell

fuck i was looking for page 10 threads to save and started writing a long post and forgot it was on page 10 and it 404d before i could bump it but i spent too long on it to just forget about it so im posting it here        1 detailed world that isnt too big  2 side activities are mostly a lot of fun  3 even minor characters have some development there arent any twodimensional quest givers  4 the game rarely gets in the way of you having fun and doing what you want to everything is less than 2 minutes away  5 main story is pretty good for a video game  6 disco  7 toptier japanese humor  8 doesnt make any apologies for being a video game doesnt take fun things out for the sake of immersion  9 majimas thug style    biggest issues are sluggish saving interface on the ps4 pseudounskippable vn style cutscenes only a problem for replays and a few bullshit minigames really only catfights    its so far one of the only games with postgame free roam that i didnt want to take a break from/stop playing after beating the main story
pisssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

wish i was that cute nekomimi meido
there goes my hero watch him as he goes

overwatch is so awful now
want a cute girl to bully me
whats wrong with overwatch
ow has basically been identical since the no multiheroes change all the way back in beta  most the changes since that other than the dva zen and mccree reworks have been really minor
how did they rework zen and mccree  i reinstalled after not playing for about 18 months and those two seem identical  i dislike how so many heroes seem to have retarded levels of mobility now and how games are unsatisfying with little back and forth
heh  scene reminds me of a certain /qa/ poster  
made this as a prototype silly image but people voiced concerns about wasted space on the left and right and also the anonymous chat so i guess that wont work  what do you guys think censored a word for 4chan
after thorough investigation i have concluded this thread to be free of machine infestation
felt bad that i wasnt mentioned in the favorite /qa/ posters thread
  on launch zennyatta was squishier with only 125 hp but he did much more damage and had stronger discord orbs so he felt like a much more involved support you had to spend more effort on not dying but then you could actually do shit other than healbotting too  of course they genericised him fairly early on by removing a lot of his damage and giving him more hp  there was also the thing where his heal orb would stay on people forever outside of los so he could just drop it on one backline flanky type like pharrah or tracer and then ignore it and go shoot stuff but that was pretty op
  zen used to die to sniper body shots in 1 hit   but his orbs used to not need los or range so you could park it on someone and always see them through walls with discord and your tracer/genji had a permanent heal ball     mccree used to have no falloff in normal shots and his right click used to hit harder and was more controllable so he was practically a sniper and could delete you in melee with stun right click this didnt come to prevalence though until much larger meta/balance issues from beta were solved though when the 2x winston 2 zen 2x genji/tracer meta ended
i have to wait a while before reporting another post
i hope its not one of mine
i post all the time and yet i dont even have a name attached to me  at least youre unique enough to be recognized

on 4taba people are nice but its dead
theres instant ramen in the pantry but its all the not very good onions sauce flavor  vegetarian imouto is a demon who will bring nothing but destruction and ruin to this household

i dont get why people lose their shit over this franchise the food is pretty bland and there is always a huge line for it the only thing it has going for it is that the portions are pretty large and not too pricey
  yeah man id just go to taco bell instead fewer hipstertype people there

  what makes you think i will click that link after reading that post

read somewhere that artists/craftsman thought getting paid for their work belittled it because they did it for themselves and didnt need any extrinsic incentive to do so can anyone verify this or tell me where the possibly false idea came from
women and fags who are mediocre at art/craft if they were intellectually honest with themselves and didnt need any extrinsic incentive to do art nobody would know that they are artists because they wouldnt share their art with anybody as they would have no reason to they obviously want something if not currency then attention or gratification
  that sounds implausible  most people would love being paid to do what they love  only issue i can see is if artistic freedom is compromised
i think you might be confusing remuneration for wage labor  independent artisans/craftsmen were always at odds with the factory system and wage labor which they saw as diminishing the standards of their craft and infringing on their independence theres a load of difference between being against wage labor and not wanting to be paid for services at all though

how/why do people become lolicons
go away
by being heterosexual males
size difference
  attraction to prepubescent features in other words pedophilia
  isnt it strange then that society at large  western society  values traits that are associated with youth for many years shaving off pubic hair has been a fad not to mention theres been a surge in the popularity of incest porn which itself involves roleplaying as minors likewise one of the most popular search terms is also teen which typically involves those who are newly turned adults or those who have feautures that make them appear younger    im no strong believer in freudian psychology but it would seem as if society at large has a very strong latent attraction to youthful features of course whether that involves hebephilia or pedophilia or some other philia is clearly up for debate perhaps it has to do with the increasingly younger ages at which children are experiencing puberty but thats purely conjecture
  its almost like there are instincts compelling people to have sex before 18 and get the youngest healthiest mate available which modern laws and culture defy
lets make our own country where sex with anyone is allowed
  well for the longest time throughout human existence it has been the case that the median lifespan was only 25 years that being the case its hardly a stretch to assume that sex before 18 was likely the norm and not the exception
  its almost like children are sexy
  theres youthful and theres prepubescent
  all heterosexual men are lolicons some are more honest about it
people are supposed to have sex at young ages but in order to satiate the bourgeoisie and their interest in both men and women working in factories people have to give up the right to it in order to benefit society
  when are lolicons going to rise up
    one thing i will say is pedophiles at least have a conscience theyll do this shitty projection to try and feel better about themselves
  and some are not yet in prison
  this
in germany you can give at 15 consent just sayin
  this might sound retarded but what does the age of consent mean isnt it still illegal to engage in this stuff with a minor not that i am ever going to need this but im still curious
  it means when someone is legally considered able to consent to sex if you sex someone younger than that its rape statutory rape
  aoc being lower than 18 doesnt matter because youll never actually get to meet someone of that age as an adult
  i know just a funny fact its technically legal but its still pretty creepy
  what about lesbian lolicons
what about female shotacons
chloe thats how
    this desu the only way it could protect you is if you fucked a cousin or neice maybe a random chat room girl but that requires 30x the luck
  most cultures outside of the west dont have a problem with pedophilia or if they do its because of western influence its natural and common
so we are under 4chan raid again
  i dont believe that number and i believe depriving people a deeply ingrained need until they are ready is healthy  i think it is why depression and mental illness are so common in the modern era this way of life is inhuman
  no let us create a country where anyone can get married but all extramarital sex is a capital offense    acceptable if they are sisterwives to a man who will sire children with both of them    righteous
  humans are a neotenous species and thus males are attracted to neotenous traits some more so than others however
      do you know what puberty is  do you understand why it happens  do you understand how genes are propagated  do you understand sexual selection    humans are the only species which arbitrarily postpones the mating and courtship process beyond the point our species has been sexually selected for this is a recent cultural shift  you are no different than the creationists who deny natural selection in favour of morally bankrupt mythology
  yes yes yes and yes whats your point
  meant for 
  that youre a dumb npc
  you didnt demonstrate how anything you said was relevant to anything
  people need sex starting at around 14  women are at peak fertility at 25  people put off having children until well past both of these and view those who dont as immoral    while i was racked with angst and insecurity at 16 the amish boy had the peace of mind and support of a fiance or wife so i tell myself hes wrong oppressive unprepared and immoral for being more successful and happier than me classic resentiment    youve internalized these morals and rationalizations for them
  which is hebephilia not pedophilia way to not be relevant to fucking anything
  all heterosexual men are lolicons  you could talk for you pedoshit not us
  hes right though
  no he isnt because im heterosexual male and not a lolicon stop projecting
  denial and anger
  im not in denial or angry youre just projecting
  go walk down the street with a sign on your back that says im attracted to young girls and see how far you get report back when you get out of the hospital
    calm down and learn to cope with it
  i dont like loli doesnt do anything for me stop projecting youre doing it to feel better about yourself and make your fetish seem more normal but it just isnt
  women are at peak fertility at 25  objectively and scientifically incorrect
  im not gay either
little girls are for loving and protecting spoilerme until i can make secure a steady supply of potions of potential/spoiler
  it seems the truth makes you uncomfortable
  can you not read or something
  yes
  what
  i decided to become a lolicon to advance my career
  whats your job
  i want to smell illyas armpit cunny
  armpitfag  better than being a footfag i suppose
  true connoisseurs are both
  bellies too
  hollywood producer
really disgusts me all these retards equating 2d to 3d the fuck is wrong with you that you would want anything to do with some 3dpd whore
  how many times are you going to take the bait did you at any point expect him to stop and say to you that youre right and not every straight guy is a pedo cmon dude its fucking 4chan stop getting buttblasted so easy
  every man is a lolicon
  even if they like old hags
  its bait  its you whos new
  i like both
  irrelevant to the debate
i recall something madthad said
sniff sniff someones posting an asuka thread on /qa/
thats what /qa/ is  the one with the sharpest bots win
is that a giga niga jangolin
  no matter how strong he gets /qa/ will always come back stronger
  asuka  is that the magic porn loli the banana riding spam loli or generic pink hair flooder  i cant keep track
  its the last one you mentioned
  kek kek dumb pangolin
better watch out or the jangolin will get yoy
sniff sniff
is /qa/ the honey badger of 4channel
  sniiiiffffffffffff
  the one with the sharpest fangs wins  /qa/ wins  honey badger has the sharpest fangs  therefore /qa/honey badger
  who is this character and where do i find her lewds
  did you watch killing bites
why do people dislike rei janny
  see 
  oh my word
breaking thread watcher
works on my end
4chan x does not have this problem but who am i kidding youre a newfag who has no clue about anything and only came here during the election
  can you watch both 4chanorg and 4channel threads at the same time the 4channel threads keep disappearing
    specifically  1 enable thread watcher on both 4chan and 4channel  2 watch a 4channel thread  3 load a page on 4chan  4 watched thread disappears from thread watcher on both sites     previously the thread watchers on 4chan and 4channel behaved independently while slightly in convenient it was at least functional
  3 load a page on 4chan  just dont do this
  4chanx is broken on firefox
  thanks for the workaround
bumping for the reason that others are going to ask this question again soon
delete /pol/
kill all weebs
feel like crying
weebspam
weebshitspam
spam thread do not respond
hope whatever it is works out
dont even have the will to cry
    spam posts
hang in there 
dont cry
  its depression
  me too
will love really cure this tightness on my chest
sometimes we all do
unable to cry but i wish i could
      okay passing this on so everybody else knows not to bump it
  werent you the one telling people to get jobs what happened to that
  havent been feeling it lately
so how are the ads working out on 4channel i wouldnt know because i block them
  devilish
  i checked yesterday and so far its the exact same ad providers we already had before the split  its noteworthy that /pol/ is now pretty much the only board on 4chan which has the same threepanel ads as on 4channel while the rest  which includes unfortunate boards like s4s  has porn ads all around
bored tired and unmotivated to do anything    why did i even wake up
to live
  i dont feel alive
to post chinese cartoon pictures
i feel like im reimu
try flying get up somewhere higher first
asian girl  asian girllllllssssss  hnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng
  nys dumb tripfag
  feel like im clownpiece only im fat balding and gay
reimu a cute
does anyone else sometimes forget that this board exists
no i check it sometimes but im sure glad the average retard forgets about it they can stay far the fuck way from there and /out/  now /aco/ and /cm/ and /qst/ those are boards i forget about
  you forget a lot english and how speak
  they found out about /out/ at least 3 years ago from all the people telling them to get 
i dont care about doing things
oldest board
this is why /ck/ and /o/ are based
leaving aside the idea of whether or not deleting posts should be a thing whats with all the weird rules about deleting posts    ive always thought these rules were strange and im curious what the thinking is    i guess the rule about the post being too old kinda makes sense but then you cant delete it too early either
  more than that whats with the whole not being able to delete posts in a sticky or on /qa/  thats the most peculiar one too me
  then you cant delete it too early either  to prevent ghostbumps where people post and delete right away i think its stupid too
  my guess is people deleted threads to falseflag mods deleting threads same thing happened on /v/
  on /qa/ its to stop the weebs from their scripted stealth bumpbot     when that thing was active they were able to keep spam threads on page 1 for over a week without any posts
  it doesnt even fix the problem since barneyfag and imitators can just get their posts deleted by mods as theyve always done you get the feeling their priority is being able to ban the people instead of cleaning up their mess
post in wrong thread  oh shit nigger  too early to delete post  post there for too long so everyone in the thread sees it  get laughed at
i commend you on your inquisitive nature i can offer a somewhat detailed chronicle of this matter    error you must wait longer before deleting this post  the first deletion policy created in late 2009 or perhaps early 2010 after some scriptkiddie tripfag called marshviperx started spamming /g/ with copypasta but instead of trying to flood it by creating new threads as it was the usual before captcha what he did was bumping old threads necrobumping and then immediately delete his posts to escape getting banned ghostbumping moot himself took notice of this and decided to introduce post deletion timers and limits not just on /g/ but all boards    error you cannot delete a post this old  introduced by moot in 2013 on all boards to prevent shitposters from attributing the deletion of their own threads to mods and janitors so they could later open threads on /q/ to complain about rogue mods deleting ontopic threads     error you cannot delete this post  introduced early this year only on /qa/ by the current administration not by hiro though hes clueless shortly after i send a detailed description of the spam wars going on in this board via the feedback page suggesting this specific measure among others to counter the ghostbumping issue might have been just a coincidence though
  all bad policy  and why would you suggest bad policy when you ought to know how to fix it properly had you actually lurked the board  what a dumbass
  all bad policy  achieved its purpose each time    and why would you suggest bad policy when you ought to know how to fix it properly had you actually lurked the board  my feedback was more complete than that but only that measure got implemented nonetheless it served its purpose getting /qa/ rid of the random letter/number spam    what a dumbass  fuck you
  achieved its purpose each time  nope youre not very observant are you and everyone should be saying fuck you if you really got the dev to remove deletion for no good reason
  would you mind posting your feedback reply here
notably if they had implemented    it would have actually had some effect on robotic bumping bumping and deleting wouldnt work and mods would be able to unbump threads that were bumped and there would be no negative impact on users
of course what would really nip robotic bumping in the bud would be switching to a working captcha system instead of continuing to use googles spyware long after it ceased to be effective against bots
  nope youre not very observant are you  yep it stopped that tripfag spam falseflagging on /q/ and the random letter/number on /qa/ youre not very observant are you
  it only stopped ghostbumping but it didnt change anything about the fact that 90 of /qa/ is proxybotbumped spam
  it didnt stop that at all they just changed up the posts little and stopped deleting them now get off the internet its time for your caretaker to change your diaper
  i never said it was meant to stop all forms of spam only ghostbumping and a particular form at that i suggested different specific ways to address the other issues as well that was the main focus of my feedback but they werent implemented
  they just changed up the posts little and stopped deleting them  forcing them to change their modus operandi means the previous method stopped working meaning they stopped using it stop moving the goalpoasts
  filtering threecharacter posts would have been a change in modus operandi by your definition but im sure even you can see why that wouldnt be helpful it just went from people deleting it themselves to mods doing it i preferred the first
to my /qa/ friends  what is your opinion of a secondary /qa/ board offsite to run in parallel to /qa/ itself at least until the time comes that /qa/ becomes unusable there has been some severe restrictions and changes done to our board recently and id like to hear opinions on our communitys future do you have any experience running an imageboard or would you care to help this is a conversation best done in the irc perhaps but id like everyone to be aware of it what would you want or expect on a secondary imageboard would you be willing to make the move for good
i think having an safety fallback in case /qa/ ever does actually get deleted is a good idea though i have no idea how to actually make one sorry however i have been trying to learn so maybe in the future i could help you guys out
you people already have like 5 different spinoffswhy cant you just use one of those and stop pretending like your community of shitposters is from /qa/
  /qa/ is /qa/
unfortunately i think the more technicalminded /qa/ friends are generally busy and itll take a while for them to see this thread but i know theyre out there
literally already exists
  but how does /qa/ even really make sense in the context of another site whats the common denominator whats the hobby    if its just a meta board on another site that you seek then theres plenty already but you cant be surprised if a lot of the meta pertains to that particular site as opposed to 4chan
  desuarchive has the nightmare captchas that make posting even more punishing than 4chan without noscript captcha
  yes
  the hell you are you have to go back
  yes to what
  think hes on ota for the time being
  hell go where i tell him to go
  take them away please take the spinoff weebs somewhere else
megucas captcha source is available and could be easily customized for our needs  apparently it uses something with danbooru
  t u r my hero
  just go to merorincom and otachcom    theyre just a bunch of /jp/ spinnoffs and to be honest most of /qa/ has just become a satellite to /jp/ and what /jp/ use to be between 2008 and 2011
pest control has been very effective
  theres nothing worthwhile or useful you can do with yet another instance of tinyboard/vichan  if you do make something youll have to put up with these freaks     why does /qa/ need a second board in the first place
dont you realize this if this board is ever going to shut down i guarantee that would be your fault
  delete this cursed image
  4taba is nice
  4taba  it can be spammed to death in about a minute
ota kind of sucks and 4taba is dead
ota  hopeless romantic and henriteen hangout
  you dont understand how the pruning system works and neither did the person who spammed it recently apparently unless you mean the site became temporarily unavailable or something      its working for me
  correction im not even sure if pruning is on in any case the spam wouldnt have pruned anything the pruning system could be improved further to be even more robust against spammers though i have an idea and i may put in a pull request    although even if floods are easily recoverable from it would be good to add cooldowns and proxy blacklists to make them more difficult
  there already is at least two fallback /qa/ and one of them is even an imageboard  /meta/ used to be the og hangout but hellcaptcha and bots make it worthless
kek  and they say the weeb mafia doesnt exist
    merorin has a pretty small user base for now but you can post more topics and discussion there than ota its like weird /int/ and /jp/ spin off perfect for /qa/ users
otachcom/jp/          samachanorg/z/  doushiocom/moe/  tohnochancom/lol/    whatchmooocom/what  4x13net            sushigirlus                        gnfoscom/jp
  somebody had to post it
  fish chan is for sale
  mero is dead once t decides to bring back gnfos for good
  or you could just go back to  where you belong
went to mero for about 5 minutes and it sucks also i saw t there so now it double sucks
we will expand to site after site founding a glorious /qa/ empire on which the sun never sets
  i saw t there   mero is the t fanclub so its probably someone heavily influenced by him
  we  you have to go back
  i like this idea if this site does come to fruition it should try to start the western imageboard renaissance
  no they dont they can go fuck themselves
  and by that i mean maybe like how people wanted /qa/ to be a hub for all of 4chan eventually the site or maybe a board could be somewhat like a place where people fron all imageboards could come to talk to each other and discuss their sites
  eat shit globalist
would /qa/ still be /qa/ if its not on /qa/
  maybe just maybe if these somehow consolidated into one then we would actually have a self sustaining community and a counterculture could actually form
i support your endeavours so long as you vanish for good afterwards
  gos almighty
  as long as it allows meta discussion and discussion of internet history and neat things on it ill accept it
  well i just checked it and everythings fine your right though i thought it marked those threads for deletion
  for good  t does such things out of spite and attention he is a silly 29 y/o man on and off on and off onif you give him bitcoinsoff again
  thats my problem there are plenty of alternative sites but anons split up and go to them on their own and none of them have that /qa/ feeling to them
remember to forbid avatar/namefagging after you make your board
  theres nothing worthwhile or useful you can do with yet another instance of tinyboard/vichan  who says its going to be restricted to a copy/paste job  why does /qa/ need a second board in the first place  because posting is becoming troublesome and mod actions are increasingly volatile with regular posters getting proxy bans by overzealous staff a second board where people can post freely like in 2017 would be much appreciated
  mero is pol9k garbage the antithesis of /qa/  anyway why go to a slow board for something thats on so many fast boards already      thats far too grand of a plan for this but i like the enthusiasm       thats an interesting idea for a site but not what i had in mind i was thinking more about the take it easy/2d random style of /qa/ which is all thats left here with value once people start talking about sites it becomes competitive and the atmosphere would be ruined      /qa/ is its users this is a board that became great despite its existence on 4chan and its having issues now related to 4channel      theyre too different from each other and have their own cultures and users
  /qa/ is its users this is a board that became great despite its existence on 4chan and its having issues now related to 4channel
i can relate to the idea but qa is qa because it does not consist of the closed circles that can be found on these satellite boards its the difference between visiting your friends at their homes or going out with them and meeting other likeminded people and of course not so likeminded people its this little spark of the unknown that can contain friendship or enmity that creates the fun
  i dont think anybody said anything about leaving /qa/ just having a place for fun on the side where people who are given hell when attempting to post can go and post easily/things that the staff doesnt allow here    really would we at least be able to discuss other sites and such or are you just focused on the 2d part because im really fond of meta discussion and talk of other imageboards and such that the mods disallow here
  /qa/ isnt going anywhere although i think you greatly overestimate the value of the generic 4chan user /qa/ used to use ghost and /meta/ a lot but its nightmarish captcha really made those places empty      yeah i kind of regret saying that internet/imageboard meta is fine i was thinking of people advertising and stuff
  wonders why discussing their spinoffs meta is not allowed on /qa/  why indeed
  as an example for a long time 4chan x was something that would get deleted and banned quite readily on /qa/ as a result a long thread for 4chan x stuff was moved to ghost alongside certain other meta threads pertaining to /qa/ such as during the freeze additionally conversation of other imageboards was relatively common on /qa/ before the listing but afterwards some threads were culled despite having good discussion   i know you werent being genuine in your post but it was a good launching platform for a point i wanted to make
  /qa/ is its users this is a board that became great despite its existence on 4chan and its having issues now related to 4channel
  i dont think anybody said anything about leaving /qa/  and i did not assume that in my post you assumed that on your part    /qa/ isnt going anywhere  again i did not assume that in my post    i think you greatly overestimate the value of the generic 4chan user  i have no idea how you can make guesses how much i estimate the average user my post was not about that but why people who are create entirely new sites still come to this place maybe your over and underestimate some things on your part though
  frogs are the solution for /qa/ blogspam
  i dont think prunings on but theres a minimum time since last reply to prune
  read the source
  what makes mero any worse than gnfos
  what would you want or expect on a secondary imageboard  posting of frogs or grotesque wojak edits is ban on sight  ability to upload small mp3s/mp4s/youtube videos with your post
  posting of frogs or grotesque wojak edits is ban on sight  thats pretty standard on any imageboard that isnt a /r9k/ or /int/ related  ability to upload small mp3s/mp4s/youtube videos with your post  this is also something extremely common people forget how outdated 4chan is sometimes
  posting of frogs or grotesque wojak edits is ban on sight  have an md5 blacklist on site now this wont actually ban the user or restrict access to the site because if a cranky shitposter noticed theyre being fought against they usually double down on their faggotry and evade or do something else worse instead if an offensive md5 is detected the user put into shadow ban mode their posts will show up to them but other users wont see them on the board   they will think that theyre on the hardest board to troll in the world as nobody ever takes their bait and they just waste time for days basically talking to a wall
  oh yes and for this to work the fact this feature exists cant be discussed on said imageboard
  all that work is unnecessary if you have sufficient moderation that actually cares about the community the various things like filters and hidden threads is an attempt at user moderation to improve the experience something staff is supposed to do once the users are doing that much disproportionate work its no wonder that the community is in a constant state of decay
  no real humans should have to respond some twisted fuckers want the validation of such actions taken   it should all be done automatic if they dont want to put in effort to real trolling like a streetsweeper pushing aside trash   i want the demoralizing effect of a troll knowing that the only one putting in effort at fighting was themselves
  i think the best solution would be if everyone were to countertroll the troll to the point that said troll left it can be done but i have barely seen it done well in a while although ive managed to dirty my reputation with certain people to the point they never respond to me so it is still effective
  bring it back
  i dont see cases where this works anymore not in years  the definition of victory has changed for what counts as succesfull trolling that used to work when both sides were more sincere
  im a nationalist and a globalist
  no real humans should have to respond some twisted fuckers want the validation of such actions taken  theres a human element involved either way whether its building a md5 list or deleting/banning manually this really isnt a problem on other imageboards though 4chan is pretty unique in having a moderation team separated from the community        it worked on /qa/ two years ago but we also had the help of bots and scripts and a completely absent moderation team its different today when the moderation team is here to ensure blackandwhite rules are followed while completely ignoring what best serves the community
  yes i remember it working out nicely i was there and even took part in it at times thats also why i had the idea of allowing that kind of countertrolling on the alternative as well of course thered be people that just deserve to be banned on spot as well but i think engaging in a bit of public humiliation and crucifixion of a poor troll would be something that people would love to engage in every once in a while maybe once the threads dead and the troll gone it can be deleted otherwise it should be left up as long as somebodys having fun in it   thats mostly my philosophy on trolls and the like as long as theres fun to be had it should be left up for people to have said fun but once the funs all dried up and people get tired of it then it should be discarded and thrown away although if somebodys getting trolled in a thread and the trolls winning then it should be deleted at least depending on the troll if the troll is just a poster from the site having fun trolling the site while not doing anything too bad it should be left up   maybe also instead of the normal spinoff/altchan method of banning people which is for usually forever or months at a time it seems it should b more structured like 4chan with less severe punishments in case anyone wants to come back and possibly become a better poster
  when the moderation team is here to ensure blackandwhite rules are followed    like banning asuka for avatarfagging when theres antiweeb boy using frogs as his or leaving pony threads up to ban barneyfag  nothing black and white about any of it
  agreed although its also important to shame anyone that feeds a troll which again was something /qa/ was/is great at  i think properly dealing with trolls should follow a basic guideline that entertaining trolls get leniency since its not really trolling if everyone is having fun likewise if its just people posting an avatar and doing u mad u mad theres on value to be had in keeping the post in existence      true enough but thats more about maintaining the atmosphere of power asuka has a notable presence frog avatars are easily forgettable and impossible to tell apart
  but thats more about maintaining the atmosphere of power  thats kinda his point ensuring blackandwhite rules are followed means that anyone that breaks the rules is punished whereas maintaining the atmosphere of power is only punishing people that encroach on your powers presence
do you not get bored of having the same thread time and again of writing so much but achieving so little
  ara whats this someone seems to be getting a bit riled up for some reason  i wonder if its scared
what
  autosaging troll threads instead of outright deleting them might work well its also reversible if a mod fucks up
  thats a pretty good idea although i do believe stuff like posting an avatar and doing u mad u mad like  said doesnt even deserve to be autosaged and should just be outright deleted
  im going to be a bit picky but i dont believe that using the word deserve is an appropriate way to approach moderating any form of trolling deserve brings with it the connotation of punishment and i think punishement is the wrong way to handle trolling rather the focus should be on how to minimize the a trolls impact and a trolls negative contribution to the community what ever that is   i think its safe to say a pure troll sees any form of nattention resulting from their actions as a reward an incentive to continue punishment of anyform is bad attention so when confronted with a pure troll punishment will only encourage the behavior that begot it if instead a pure troll is utilized as form of community entertainment then you will encourage a pure troll to act in a way the produces community entertainment its not alway the case that a trolls actions have entertainment value to the community but one should develope a system that either causes trolls to die get bores and leave or extracts some sort of community value from them i also think that killing trolls is like improperly using antibiotics on bacteria you may kill 9999 of the bacteria but that 001 of survivors has a chance to develop a resistance to the antibiotics and come back as a seemingly unstoppable plague   i realize you may not mean punishment when you use deserve but the intentions of posts need to be clear so we can appropriately address any situation put forward
  i thought on what you said for a while and while i do agree in the ultimate goal of giving trolls the least amount of attention possible i also think that just leaving them up is also unhealthy even if theyre on autosage while the entertaining trolls will come and go with people enjoying their time and not really caring about it i think that the boring trolls whose sole purpose is to just take up space on the board and ave their presence observed by others should have their posts deleted the reason being that those things do not care as much about people responding to them as they do having their existence be present in front of those they dislike all they want to do is to be an eyesore and leaving them up will cause people who look at the board to observe said eyesore while you may not think of it as that big a deal in your own opinion since the threads of course would be on autosage that viewpoint may not be the case for others they may see those threads on the board and then believe the board itself to be lower in quality just because of those threads they want the entire board to look nice and populated with enjoyable/interesting/fun things having threads that serv no purpose other than to annoy people and drag down the quality of the board is in my opinion very harmful to said board especially when getting away from such garbage may be one of the reasons people decide to use a board
ive never really thought about the autosage vs deletion thing for slow boards on 4chan it can work but im not sure how good autosage would be when threads can either lasts for months if theres a thread limit or years if there isnt  in catalog mode it can leave unsightly blemishes and in page mode it clogs up space
have long toes  they are permanently in a claw position  have trouble with footwear as they make pressure against the shoe causing it to tear off    why is this happening is there anything i can do about it or do i need to just learn to live with it
your feet look fine michael
i guess youre a flipflop person
  its not about the looks anymore im tired of buying new shoes because of this      on summer and spring i wear flip flops and on winter and autumn i wear crocs with socks this is the life i was given
  but what is your most weared footwear  what is the thing that you wear the most  trust me  there is a reason why im asking
    nowadays crocs i go with them to the uni to worketc i wear shoes when i go exercise or when i go out with friends
  i see i thought that this is due to overwearing flip flops maybe due to its toe separating thing you might have bent your toes into this position
    damn it maybe thats why you know any possible solutions start wearing shoes more often
ew  ew  ewwwwww  i hate seeing the tendon stick in foots  its looks like someone could tear it offf    hnnnnnnnng    btw im a girl
  that my mild solution wear socks and long shoes in order to change the rest of the toes instaid of the thumb toes you can also try to wear shoes where they have toes in order to shit your toes into their normal position i do not recommend normal shoes because there might be a chance that your thumb toes will bent to the rest of the toes  not in a good way  the other maybe extreme solution is going to a doctor and fixing them with surgery
  maybe u have damaged nerves that needs to be checked or needs a massage go see a doctor
post more pics please
  go minimalist those hipster barefoot shoes come in all kinds of crazy shapes and sizes
  whats with your fuckin body hair big shoots you look like a twelveyear old dutch girl
so basically ive been in love with my best friend for almost 2 years now and i was friendzoned a year ago when i spilled the beans    we didnt fall apart and stayed friends do you think it would be a good idea to ask her again 1 year later or it may damage our friendship completely
did she show any romantic interest towards you in that one year if not no it wouldnt be a good idea retard
how would you feel if you had stated your opinon about something a year ago but it turns out the other party has been mulling over that for a year   it would be awkward as fuck just get over it or stop seeing her based paster
there is a whole board for that  
the only thing you need to do is to tell her that you like someone else and wait a bit for her to change her attitude completely cant believe im replying to normalproblems but whatever first and the last time
___
i am noticing that mods are currently becoming very strict on all boards stay vigilant
you browse all boards simultaneously
you would be less bothered if you tried making posts that werent garbage its going to take a while yet to get things into reasonable shape most of /jp/ should deserves to eventually get banned it will be interesting to watch
  i have been getting warned/banned for totally reasonable posts
  stay on reddit fucking nigger
  chill bro were cool with reddit now
  because people have been purposefully shitposting harder because of 4channel    i havent been getting banned or warned at all maybe make better posts and stop act
  maybe make better posts and stop act   and stop acting like a snowflake who dindu nuffin
  kill yourself sneed posting faggot
  did you mean to respond to someone else
  kill yourself sneed posting faggot
  okay mindless shitposting
fuck the jan
  but most importantly    fuck niggers
toot its down
give me 3 good reasons why irc is better than discord
  say please
no teens  faster   no spies
not a honeypot  not bloatware  not created for gamers
no identity worries  less bloat  font options
it isnt    and neither is better than valve chat
  teen
  do you even know whose face that is
no images  no link embedding  announces your ip when you join the chat  cant read backlog
1 open standard    thats enough for me
    where is her mouth
  are you blind
no avatars no images no voicechat
doesnt have you  doesnt have that retard  has me
  i love it when newbies join irc for the first time and freak out when they realize everyone can see their ip and where theyre from
      wrong      i love this anime so freakin much
  what was wrong about 
  no identity worries
  but i dont have to worry about my identity
  you use a name on irc thats an identity  furthermore you can pm users so its really not that different from discord in terms of profiling
heh
  no teens  yeah  sure
  its better because it has less features
  can you do this in discord
  its better because it has less features  actually thats exactly the case
  its time to upgrade your computer if it cant handle a few pictures grandpa
spyware and bloatware really mumble is still the supreme king though
  exactly i want neither pictures nor their shitty client
making memes for tripfags  god damn it /jp/ was cancer
no recaptcha challenge  no second recaptcha challenge  no third recaptcha challenge
  /thread
  what did you do
now answer why discord is cancer for teenbros but steam isnt
  i havent used irc very much but when i used rizon it would show a hotmask which really isnt an ip address even then you could hide it with a vhost which i made sure to do maybe some servers show your actual ip i wouldnt know one way or the other
its not electron cancer
  steam chat is cancer too but no one give a shit never heard of it outside of this board
ran yakumo waited the lights above her blinked and sparked out of the air there were chens in the base she didnt see them but had expected them now for years her warnings to cernel yukari were not listenend to and now it was too late far too late for now anyway  ran was a suppa tenko for fourteen years when she was young she watched hina and said to yukari i want to spin one day  yukari said no you will be kill by chens  there was a time when she believed her then as she got oldered she stopped but now in the mayohiga of gensokyo she knew there were chens  this is yukari the radio crackered you must fight the chens  so ran gotted her spin on and smashed through the wall  she going to kill us said the chens  i will spin at her said the suppa chen and she spun at ran ran spun at her and tried to smash her up but then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to spin  no i must kill the chens she shouted  the radio said no ran you are the chens  and then ran was cheeeeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnnnnnn

theres literally nothing wrong with any of these threads you fragile gremlin

quick question guys how can you find the expiration date of a 4chan pass  or is it just not possible   i feel like it should show the expiration date on the authorization page but it is not there so is there another place to check
  probably a good idea to crosspost this to     maybe check your mail you used to sign up with
  who keeps year old emails  i think it was a gift anyway  reeeeeeeee
  you should get an email reminder week before expiration date
  i have emails that are over 20 years old
  good for you autistical autist  i have over 50 nontemp emails  i couldve used any of them to purchase it  ffs just show the expiration date on the auth page
  buy your emails a beer for me
how do you get your pass to work on the 4channel boards mine only works on the nsfw boards since the split
  you have to go to 4channel auth page and authenticate on it too auth twice technically you can post using two dif passes atm  because i guess the web guys have no idea wtf they are doing  it would be very easy to store the auto on both using a single page especially using localstorage to create the cookie for the other board
  youre basically blaming 4chan for your own problems with organization and keeping track of shit  you have only yourself to blame  can you not use your memory and try to think of when you bought it in the first place  its kind of ridiculous what youre doing  youre like im mentally disabled so you should change things around for me because im stupid
    where is the 4channel authentication page i can only find the 4chan nsfw authentication page
please for the love of the godministrator hiro release us from this hell     recaptcha has really gotten brazen as of late our usual workload training the google botnet models have been increased 10fold it does not matter what device/ip youre on eventually you will get a day where you will be put in the sweatshop solving 50 captchas before getting one that lets you through lately i have had captchas that say success and i will go to post only to have it say it was wrong i think google is just trying to make us work our balls off afterall it is literal free labor for them training their selfdriving car models    please hiro implement one of the copious open source captcha solutions out there i cant believe bandwidth is an issue for you and that is the reason you use recaptcha it is just a small frame in an already huge site with millions of pages you have to send data on a post anyway if its about money and 4chan passes please make the 4chan passes offer something additional rather than hindering the use of the site overall recaptcha is out of hand and is already against the spirit of anonymity using big brother schlock like google services please hiro release us
  yea im thinkin im in
st calle please come back and save us
  just buy a pass anon theyre only 20    google killed it itll never return
  just buy a pass anon theyre only 20    newfags being this ignorant of anonymity
  i would if i didnt have to jump through a gorillion hoops to buy fucking bitcoin since hiroshimoot wont take paypal or credit cards anymore
  even if your payment was 100 anon protip bitcoin is not fundgible it is still just a useless way to sign yourself up to be a user being tracked on some list this isnt reddit there is no sign up page or a gay ass profile if people want to buy passes because they have stockholm syndrome and will pay to make a site functional instead of demanding it work in the first place thats their choice
tfw you use the appropriate forum to post your formal feedback for the site on and 95 of 4channel users will never see it and will be swallowed into a sea of anime spam    cest la vie i guess what they say
  you are newfag enough to not know that your posting history is available to every data company and intelligence agencies
  dont block googles cookies you dont even need to solve anything that way and then you have that 5 min or so grace period where 4chan lets you post without even having to check the box
  and then you have that 5 min or so grace period where 4chan lets you post without even having to check the box  its exactly 1 minute    but does it still work for you it stopped working for me yesterday and i now have to solve a captcha for each post instead of getting 23 in within the minute of free authentication i thought that fuckup was on 4chans end because i didnt change or update anything /
i can hardly justify posting at all because of the captcha issues unbearable
posts a reply on a public forum  expects people to only reply to their own op    
  yes it still works it lasts 3 minutes actually but it doesnt work crossdomain like if you solve a captcha here on /qa/ youll get your 3 min freeposting but only on 4channelorg
whats this
google ads
but when i turn off ublock its still a blank space  how do i remove blank sapce
negative space where an ad would normally be you can block it
  4cghanx blocks ads too  go to ublock origins options  my filters  add the line  bsacnt  it should remove the blank space
  but when i turn off ublock its still a blank space  its because devkun hasnt gotten around yet to update the 4chan javascript files to include those ads only the board templates to create the space for them

whats another kiwi doing browsing /qa/
  me
  first the timezone coinciding with lunchtime second the brown sign indicating the lookout is the same style we have in australia and third the flowers outside the window indicating that its spring/summer to some degree the architecture and being near a port as well i was trying to find you on maps
  thats my line im not sure this place is big enough for 2two kiwis    well arent you quite the little detective
  bruh there fuckin 3
  indeed
  do kiwis make up the majority of /qa/  big if true    spooky you really are a super sleuth
  nah man i only just remembered this board existed so came for a peep
look /qa/ a horse

how would the site be different if you had to upload a camera picture in order to phonepost
  same time zone but nope
/qa/nons live in nice places
  i havent been there much in a while it isnt as fun anymore
  it would be extremely spacious
  ok
  kek
  spooky
  exposed
    thats assembly square in somerville ma
  fucking lucky
  op here good job for you for figuring this out do you live nearby or looked up on the web     this area really stands out compared to the centuriesold infrastructure in most areas near boston by the way
  the building on the right looked familiar im two cities away but the white licence plates  the windshield registration sticker on that suv confirmed my suspicions of it being nearby then i went on google maps and matched the saks off 5th logo to find the exact location ive only been to assembly square a few times theres been a lot of development in the area lately the skyline isnt going to be chicago or new yorktier but it still looks refreshing
there are probably /qa/non living in the same city with me
  i cant believe it i thought we were completely spread out
  nice
long exposure of where i was about two hours ago and couldnt post from because the open wifi was banned its just the local square up the street
  snow is nice go make a snowman
  it doesnt snow much where i live now i miss the snow but i dont miss the cold
heres where i was an hour ago
hows the weather in new zealand
  commuting before 7am  i feel sorry for you italianon
  they are all melted here
  its cold today in auckland and there are supposed to be thunderstorms but its currently clear and calm mostly raining for the next week
and now the rain just arrived
  its been raining heavily for the last few days it cleared up for a bit this morning but now its at it again
  rained here in the morning
  the same shot at day
  i deduce this is your room
snowing today again
  hmmmm    using my amazing deductive powers ive figured out that you are in the northern hemisphere
  truly amazing    with a minute of research you can tell the poster that he shouldve walked half a km north to photograph an actual park instead of this sad square
  thanks you see i noticed that there were leaves on the ground and from this i deduced that it must be autumn where this picture was taken then after a little bit of research i figured out that it must have been taken in the northern hemisphere
  too bad
  and snow from last night didnt pile up
  figure me out detectivekun
  not him but maybe we could figure out your precise location if you made a less pathetic photo
  how am i supposed to do that  not my fault its night ill just do one more tomorrow when its day
  how am i supposed to do that  the absolute state of phoneposters  
  nice try fbi
  it looks familiar but its probably just generic
  how do you have a phone signal
  not him but satellite internet is a thing
  hows this
  the /qa/ horse
  goddammit anon youre keeping me awake all night    generic balkanlan commieblocks with mountains in the distance so east of the main alps  it has a mix of cold pines and willows and other leafy trees so that should exclude anything north of minsk and south of sofia  i can only find a good amount of highrises with wedged rooftops in the serbia/bulgaria area  i think those decorative concrete bricks on the stairwell are specific to one country but i dont know which  if ive skipped over some district of the city it might be budapest    good job on taking such a detailed but generic photo maybe someone who lives in your country has a better shot at this
  you dont call them screens
  2008  you must live in bumfuck nowhere if they havent driven a car by in a decade
   thats the way i like it
  they have actually earlier this year
im fed up with this place im going home for a bit
  its pretty close ill give you a hint mountains
  bulgaria
  shitslavistan
  the timezone does not match
  id be more worried about having oxygen
  what kind of sorcery is this
  bulgaria doesnt have ices      i cant narrow it down any further than you being on any of these routes   cant find a place to look up a train by serial number or at which stations an icet would depart at 14011410 from platform 6 or 8    wait a minute you posted earlier here didnt you i assume you took line 8 because walking is gay and the weather is shit today
  for some reason the nov 2008 view only links to jul 2008 while jul 2008 links to both nov 2008 and apr 2018
  weird i never knew this was a thing
  close it was indeed ice 1508 from platform 7
      get out of my city
  germany frankfurt
  the first paragraph was rambling about how to pinpoint your location using the train on platform 8  the second paragraph was realizing that you might be the same guy from earlier so i only had to confirm in gmaps that the station looked the same as on the photo  close  do you mean you didnt take line 8 to the hbf because it runs through the street where you took the other photo  ice 1508   way to dox yourself       yes no
went hiking the other day
  friendly reminder to double check your photos before posting them be sure that  your reflection isnt visible anywhere and  disable metadata if you are taking photos with a smartphone some models will record your exact gps location and save it into the photos metadata if you dont do it  thank me later
  disable metadata  provide any jpeg on 4chan with metadata  kthxbye    also that reflection while hilarious only gives us a vague silhouette nothing identifiable
  mite be white
  all images on /p/ have metadata preserved     ive heard that lots of africans travel to hk for trading even though a visitor visa does not allow them to do so
  cute buddy
  what countries are /qa/ from
  northern hemisphere
  /qa/ of course
  no patrick /qa/ is not a country  its a way of life
  thats a continent
    looks like eastern us to me though not quite appalachia yet because its still pretty flat
  it gets stripped now but the stripping process used now is highly inefficient and vulnerable to zip bombs it can be fixed but dont be surprised if you go on 4chan one day and its been temporarily disabled
red bank new jersey train station
  you should clean your room
  nice anon redbank is comfy as fuck  really good food options too
  ok reimu i will
  it really is its a fully functional small city thats safe and clean and always has some kind of event going on  i went to triumph brewery  the porter zitroweis and amber ale were great
its going to rain later and make everything gross
think ill take a picture later when im somewhere that isnt a dead giveaway as to where i am
  im thinking bout taking one once it snows right now it just looks like shit outside
    im not allowed to post any picture anymore because gookmoot is a corrupt/incompetent retard
  he doesnt have an ethernet reel to take to the sidewalk
  all that lawn to mow
  for dog poo
  is hong kong or singapore worth the move  another city id like to live in is kuala lumpur because its built up cheap and a bit 3rd worldy still like the lack of law development so you can get away with more
  dunedin  fuck why the hell would you live in that cold shithole  i get queenstown and wanaka perhaps even christchurch but i dont get dunedin
  carpathian or balkan
  edmonton
  i was on holiday hong kong is great if you like heavily urbanized and international cities but it sounds like you dont have large sums of money to throw around you can get smaller apartments further out but theyre typically in brutalist high rises for the ones closer to the city and smaller towns/villages further towards the chinese border i enjoyed my time there as a tourist as i usually live in very quiet suburbs but i dont think i would like to live there permanently
  i dont mind a bit of dirtiness infact its sorta neat having that sorta cyberpunky feel to it  i got that big time in the seedy areas of kl and singapore
  thats a few blocks away from wall street anon you must be making quite a lot of shekels
  infact its sorta neat having that sorta cyberpunky feel to it  not him but thats the kind of thing you wont like when dealing with everyday
  what sort of state is /qa/ a republic a monarchy
  its not really that cold just slightly colder than chch   i get queenstown and wanaka perhaps even christchurch but i dont get dunedin  chch is alright but i couldnt think of anything worse than living in queenstown or wanaka    unless i was selling drugs to rich tourists that could be a sweet gig
  inb4 hes just a janitor
  lots of extreme close ups of thumbs or penisespenises/penises
  an anarchy of /qa/ friends
  whats with that description
im in the office
  i like to think of /qa/ as being a state within a state so we are more like isis or hezbollah
  did you develop mirrors edge
  you should be a detective
  perhaps the best system of nongovernment

is /qa/ the dark souls of 4chan
/qa/ is the golden retriever of 4chan
/qa/ is the estes kefauver of 4chan
dumblr is ded
i cant believe theyre axing the only reason anybody ever went to the shithole worse yet you know everyone will just move to an even worse shithole twitter which is completely unoptimized for posting art and converts every still image into a jpeg pixiv will definitely see an uptick from this id wager
    porn is degenerate
  dumb moralfag  nu/pol/ and 2016 were a mistake
  im not even /pol/ i think it hurts women more than men
  go back to your reddit hideout
  fuck off moralfag
    classic npc respsonses  porn good cried the incels
  classic npc respsonses  porn good cried the incels  baste
  bitches about people drawing  drawing should be banned because hurts feelings   you heeb
    i hope they do move to pixiv or da since ive found tumblr the handful of times ive used it for porn to be as bad as or even worse than twitter
the trick where you include at least one transparent pixel in your image to keep twitter from converting the fullsized one into jpeg should still work by the way
  da   lol   anyway most of them already have patreons i am waiting for some artists to announce their further plans regarding the move
  i hope they dont continue to shit up pixiv or any other good website    im sick of going on pixiv and seeing horrendous art draw by 12 year olds and aspies that doesnt even belong on the site in the first place    why are the japs allowing this shit
  im sick of going on pixiv and seeing horrendous art draw by 12 year olds and aspies that doesnt even belong on the site in the first place  pixiv is for anyone regardless of skill and there has always been shitty art on it
    pretty sure a lot of japanese artists abandoned pixiv for twitter after pixiv tried pulling that they owned anything posted on their site    its pretty damn annoying to discover that an artist has stuff on their twitter that isnt on their pixiv
sad
  where do i get my degenerate furry roleplaying porn now
  /qa/
hey gook moot the catalogs on most boards are frozen or are slow to update /sci/ has been stuck on the same page for two days and /a/ only changes every 30 minutes
hiro ffs  the  british pound symbol is an ascii character if it helps it happened on /r9k/
its not an ascii character you sillyhead its an eascii or high ascii character
  theres no good reason for banning   its right there on my keyboard why cant i type  instead of gbp this place is like nazi germany
united arab kingdom
  my theory is either mods did it on accident or there was some horrible poundsign spammer that most people dont know about
  from what i understand nonascii characters have been banned from the start because they make it too easy to evade the robot if you think  deserves an exception you should write to feedback
there is too many porn on /b
at
complaining about porn on porn board
then dont use it fuckin retard
be the change you want to see in the world
halp  theres too much porns
  why do you think im here genius
you ever think its weird how no one cares about /b/ anymore  im not saying it was good but it used to be what people thought about when someone said 4chan and now it seems like people think of /pol/ and /r9k/
its not weird at all  the content got stale and the cultural locus of 4chan shifted
it is weird can /b/ even be called an entry board anymore what is a modern /b/tard
  pornfags ruined /b/     that is the soul reason
/b/ used to be one of the most infamous places on the internet it was the primary gateway of this site and boogeyboard that anons used to blame for problems on the boards they frequented  now few anons even realize /b/ exists  was it the fappening that killed that place by turning it into a porn dump whos even still posting there
  porn and dickfags
  and the cultural locus of 4chan shifted  you mean the cultural focus of the western internet
  /b/ stopped being the cultural epicenter of 4chan before web20 social media culture really got its claws in the site
  the most popular entry board is /pol/  many newfags make their way to it from mentions on other conservative sites like reddits donald trump board
it became the 10th most popular board and isnt even in the official list it became insanely fast
furries are cancer
  jokes on you most threads arent even furfag related
  this isnt a joke
  i know
the rare nonfetish threads are pretty good
  i rather meant if the board is still being used for shit threads to get moved over there from other boards by mods as this was the original concept of the board now it seems like all threads are native /trash/ instead of push overs
  yeah it seems like its intended purpose was ignored almost immediately after it was created
  the kpop thread flood is really strange it almost seems like spam and not organic at all
  those threads seem like mindless chatrooms its hard to believe people get any joy out of posting in them
  its unironically discordshit the same discordshit that also puts threads on /mu/ and /bant/ the extra threads like gaypg and loona and such are just derivative breakoff groups
    its funny how the discordfags always stand out like sore thumbs whenever they decide to suddenly shit on a board
  threads are still regularly moved to trash usually if they are decent discussion but too red for a blue board its just that people who wanted to have these threads learned that it was just easier to post them on /trash/ in the first place and combined with /d/ having shit mods who gate fetishes /trash/ is now basically the red board of choice for all of the blue boards to post niche porn on
so are you able to answer me
you dare question me
wtf mods  sticky this
watch out
watches out
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i wish it was winter  please post cuties with hot tea coffee cocoa etc
as you command
you have a whole board for this
  nopan
  for once youre actually right
what are some things that are impossible to discuss on 4chan    pic related
the simpsons
六四事件
this reminds me of the time of 4chan when you couldnt discuss climate change because of the ate chan wordfilter
a certain subatomic particle believed to grant mass
i always wondered why nanashii was translated to anonymous not nameless
because anonymous wasnt invented with the imageboards
  how old is 0037
  dunno  i dont even know if he is alive  but i know that shii is alive   golgolmois is still racists faggot and god bless poor rir7  i wonder how they are now
    idk who any of those people are lel
  0037 had a texboard/wiki but it disappeared a month or two ago  
  arent those basically synonyms
add politics outside of /pol/ the list list of reportable offenses
this actually used to be a rule no joke
  what about being gay outside of /lgbt/
  did someone challenge your worldview and make you upset
  playing video games outside of /v/ is now a banable offence
offtopic global rule 3 other rule violations usually go along with it as well   a very little bit of offtopic and only offtopic can be alright once in a while so long as it isnt a thread made for it and as long as it doesnt disturb the topic of a board   naturally flowing discussion that tries to remain ontopic and remains respectful is good conversation    who am i kidding most of you are as intelligent as bricks morally void and as socially retarded as badger
  how rude of you a badger makes for fine enough company also digits
  this rule isnt enforced if youre using /tv/ as a yardstick
  why the fuck would you use a webpage as a yardstick that makes zero sense /tv/ has no defined length and you cant even hold it to measure something
add this post made me butt devastated to the list
do you remember if there was report option of participate/instigating a flame war
  ppolitics is bbad
  raiding
  every political discussion on 4chan is just some guy parroting memes
can we just get a miscellaneous tag already and have the mods stop fucking playing political games with the report form
  you absolute shit head
if politics is allowed on all boards then why cant i post ponies everywhere too
just spam pictures of sinks like a complete fucking autist op
  because the mods are more fond of traps and gay porn comics than ponies
  im only saying what the website should be like rules arent there for no reason its not my fault moderation thinks its only the fault of the userbase when they are the only ones with the tools to remove garbage
  dumping infographics and using meme phrases isnt discussion
  we seriously need this theres gay retards everywhere
  then how would op start new threads
what is the /qa/ alcohol of choice
ginger ale
store brand dark rum mixed with coke
dont drink alcohol its bad for you drink tea instead
seagrams 7 mostly mixed though for what i prefer to drink on its own id say white or red wine no real specific brand choice but those normally taste the best to me      i like mixing my tea with alcohol sometimes works great
vodka  water  crystal light is pretty good when frozen
heineken
i only drink dr pepper
  arent you a bit young to be drinking
  fucking kill yourself holy shit how can you be this much of an underage cocksucker
  eww    this    absolut/cranberry or ballentines plain
  what kind of tea and alcohol do you mix
  if its just beer its fine its not a problem until he starts taking flasks of whisky to school
for me its pbr and any 175 of whisky you can get for under 30
  its not healthy to only drink one soda you need to mix up water coffee soda and alcohol
flensburger winterbock
just vodkaapple/etc juice but i rarely drink  dont really like alcohol the shittiest drug
looks like he fell asleep waiting for replies to his posts on /qa/ again poor guy
  if the answer is anything but whatever is on hand youre a goober
  cheap beer
sake
good whiskey when i can afford it cheap whiskey with a craft ipa chaser when i cant lately ive taken to making my own
i dont drink anymore but it used to be gin
anyone else really sad because theyre a neet  lonely
yeah
being lonely but not wanting to be around people is a sign of autism
get a blog faggots
  it just means the people around you are shit
  i have autism 
i never understood being sad about being a neet being a neet is great the world is shit avoiding it is the best possible life
  if you cut yourself off from the world you dont have anything to do   everything is dull and meaningless  you can entertain yourself but it all seems so shallow
  the inner world is far more rich what do norms do they go to stupid parties or movies or stuff those are the kind of things id actively go away from in order to sit down and contemplate    what i do is i get a thought here is one i was thinking yesterday a weapon that not only kills someone but it travels back through time and kills every single second of that person thus making it like they never existed this weapon is known to society    think through the societal implications  it could be used as an execution method to bring back the victims of murderers but it would have the side effect of meaning any known murder you know is never solved if it was you wouldnt have known about it nobody would ever remember using this weapon on anybody    then maybe at the end of someones life they have the option to have it used on them was your life worth preserving in history they would consider society could retroactively cull negative influences to create a perfect one but this could be used to oppress people as well     the societal view of what a life is would change as well because complete removal from ever existing is a possible death normal death might not seem like such a meaningful thing anymore the idea of permanence of action becomes the new life and so people will go through great lengths not to be killed by this weapon built in suicide mechanisms people can trigger would be seen as a sort of insurance or armor against this you lose some of your functionality to society like someone amputating a limb your future contributions are now gone but you still continue because your past ones remain    the implications just keep coming to mind and thats just one thought anon imagine all the infinite things you can imagine
  people would live entire lives full of complete degeneracy and depravity thinking they could just undo it at the end they would trade their place in civlization for doing whatever they want    killing a parent in such a way becomes a problem so society moves to artificial births people who get killed in such a way every iteration of them dies including the first two celled version of them the people who run these incubation facilities they would see some vats are not viable they would know this person was removed from history at some point    there would be a statistic percent of viable births people would worry one day a massive spike in non viable births is a war coming a complete absence of non viable births does everyone die naturaly due to some catastrophe
    i dont see how this sort of thing is fufilling or meaningful
  ive obtained ideas and developed thoughts in the end thoughts are all that really matter since the universe is mind
how do i report a thread where all of the posts in it are extremely low quality
  right click next to your name the little triangle there
  no i know how to report i mean theres a thread with an okayish op but literally all the posts in it are rancid garbage    my question is do i report the op or do i report the individual posts
  yes
  you leave the thread
  you leave the board
  you leave the website
  you leave the internet
  you turn off your computer and kys
  you disperse
  you ascend to a higher plane of existence  aka just go to a seperate thread
his mental health has deteriorated so much he started spamming a thread that had already reached bump limit a day before just because it had a frog    
he cant allow threads that expose his nefarious activity to stay in the catalog
who
  the psychopath that thinks hes the 4chan police and made it his sworn duty to turn /qa/ in an epic 2d/random board just like 4chan always wanted and needed and dont tell him that his efforts are meaningless because its only been two years so far and maybe after 4 or 5 hell start to make an impact
oh boy cant wait for this thread to be samefag replied until bump limit
  are you ok dude
  bbut mmuh community  muh /qa/ 2drandumb dream
  your damage control is not very effective   also you have severe mental problems  maybe get help for that
  heres an ironic wannabe weeb making a cameo
  im not the guy hes referring to i was just saying that because he writes like a spastic
  lel  get angry at hiro for not implementing a circlejerk board after making multiple threads asking for it  gets told to go post on your shitty spin offs  start raiding the meta board when trump wins  ththis will show them  lel the state of libtards

fuck yotgo what a dickhead
  ikr imagine coming everyday to the metaboard to see this awareness thread about the mentally ill spammer who has been raiding the meta board then imagine him getting triggered at the site of this thread hell then have a relapse and start sliding the board with inane threads to create a make believe community with his shitcord efriends imagine doing this for two whole years around the clock while ironically taking it easy rofl    its great
i love how they think they stand against fake drama while simultaneously being the largest drama producers on this board
  its just meta talk about the cancer infecting /qa/  its like you never had been in a meta discussion in your life
threads like this make me realize that we have far more than one mental case on this board and yes they are on both sides well as long as its entertaining you can continue to dance
  based  multiple sides  implying its not one guy larping
  its not live action you goddamned halfbrained chimp its just roleplaying
  by sargons tendies its taken a few years but this board will soon be ours boys ive devised an extra /devilish/ ploy to get this fuckface to go further balistic and its posting frogs in his shitty threads    know your place wojakfag we made you and can unmake you even if we crazy we the based crazy that has more acomplishments than devoting your life to but still failing to control a jap shitposting board     and fuck niggers

  more than people care about this board yes
its not /tv/ because there isnt some faggot pedo posting cp every other fucking hour and the mods and hiro do nothing about it    get his fucking ip and send it to the fbi for fucks sake
  apparently you havent seen what /tv/ looks like right this moment
there should be another domain for sort of blue boards

  well it does seem to be named after their upvote feature
  upvote feature  explain
  see those plus signs by the post if you click them it adds an upvote and turns into sou da ne times the number of upvotes it doesnt do anything else posting sou da ne is roughly the same as posting this and i assume they wanted to cut down on those kind of posts
ｷﾀﾟﾟ 
  it looks like the content of every post on the board is automatically そう だ ね and they have to write their real post in an image

  comparing boards to reddit  not only should you not be doing that at all any more but /s4s/ isnt anything more or less than a refuge for what pretty much amounts to sheer shitposting that keeps people from subjecting other boards to their impulses and i dont get how people dont understand that
  oh shit just the other day i was thinking how interesting it would be if there was a board that actually used the image board aspect of 4chan instead of just having it be a slightly annoying requirement for starting a thread or bringing attention to your post    we should have that kind of board that would be pretty based
  people have been asking for /io/  images only on /qa/ for years now
  wow i didnt know that was still wordfiltered
can someone explain this i see that everywhere on there
  
  it was looking like such a nice end but then she grew them back

is hiro ever going to lift the rangebans i havent been able to post outside of /qa/ in years
the range bans are there for good reasons tell your neighbors to stop spamming
good board idea if you get banned on all boards youre then sent to /prison/ a board only accessible to other such folk
  im not convinced its due to spamming hiro just really wants me to buy a pass
  go to feedback and submit a range ban lift request
  that doesnt work mods dont give a fuck about the users
  did you actually try
  who hasnt
i hope when advertisers start pulling out of advertising on this website the reason for doing so will be incompetent moderation or the inability to moderate content on the website  this is the wake up call thats needed hiro needs to know his website is moderated by people who leave fetish threads up and ban users who report them and then do something about it    like what is even the point of this website if it isnt good for the people who actually care about the topic if people dont want to moderate it properly just delete the topic boards and tell everyone to go to a new /b/ with 400 pages
  why would advertisers care about that
  implying anyone here knows how advertising works
  because it shows the people in charge are utterly incompetent and will go back on their word for their own gain you know its a poor environment for the people using that website as well you dont do business with those kinds of people you dont show what youre selling on that kind of website because its not professional it makes you look like you dont even care about what youre selling or that what youre selling sucks so much youre desperate and will resort to plastering it on a trashy website dont associate yourself with garbage and youll give yourself a better name      as someone who has had experience in advertising a very successful business i think i do have a decent idea
  as someone who has had experience in advertising a very successful business i think i do have a decent idea  a likely story
  to be fair advertising on a website isnt the best way to do it anyway having your own website and paying to have keywords and key phrases lead to your website on google is far better although that wouldnt work for hiro the income is from having advertisements on the website guess who can afford that type of largescale longterm flooding of advertisements do you think best buy or walmart want to advertise on /v/ or /vg/ as they are right now what about netflix on /a/ espn on /sp/ none of this is counting the fact that its not good for the people who legitimately do care about those interests and can act mature the more you understand all sides of this the more you understand how vital proper moderation is i want hiro to be successful with ads from big players because that would mean this will be a better website for everyone
gookmoot needs to hire /qa/ cheerleaders
lets do it reddit
not so fast
how is that any different from kids dumping their discord invites into /b/ or /r9k/
but why do they hate anime and video games so much
  go to any nonanime related subreddit then try telling me again with a straight face that the average redditor likes anime   pro tip you literally cant
  /r/anime is one of the biggest subreddits though
the fuck is this
  posts from the ops reddit accounts
  reddit hates anime  some people on 4chan hate anime  people who hate anime on 4chan are from reddit    t hitler who also wrote words
  it literally is not the big subs have over a million subscribers /r/anime has been around for more than 9 years yet its still stuck at 700000k meanwhile /r/dankmemes has over 1 million

  ive fucked more girls than you and muh future wife is nitori

is an actual apartheid ocurring in israel is climate change that fucked up is communism actually good where to get questions on this shit like unbiased news sources
im sorry op but youre either too young or an idiot to be asking such questions
  im 17 so theres that
  is an actual apartheid ocurring in israel  yes  is climate change that fucked up  yes but not in the way they say it is  is communism actually good  no but capitalism isnt any better      sayonara
  there is no such thing as unbiased it isnt even possible if you try everyone has a viewpoint and nobody knows everything the best you can do is recognize the bias and compare multiple sources     to answer your questions  not exactly but close enough it also has shades of the lebensraum doctrine  its even worse and dont let anyone whos not an atmospheric physicist tell you otherwise  no but neither is laissez faire capitalism
  reborded
  im aware finding a 100 reliable source is impossible and that its in us to find the truth i kind of wanted to ask where do you get most of your news from but i guess you research from more than a single one as an everyday joe i wonder just how many people rely on specific places to get their news from
  exactly who the fuck are you what are you gonna do with clean unbiased news huh    youre nothing  shut up and go read news where you get it
  ive never thought about it but yeah ill probably do nothing regarding any of those issues other than vote
  dumb ass   i was trying to put you down and you fell for it    why cant you stand up for yourself man  say that you are something  and will do something
  ill probably die anyway idk    i guess i can say i am horny  and will have lots of sex
  for news read lots of newspapers and especially avoid places like facebook     for scientific and medical information you usually have to read journals and academic reviews the popular media almost always get their science reporting wrong because the reporters dont know anything about the subject
  read lots of newspapers  i mean including the ones you dont like
  ive read tons of scientific reports on animals can understand most things    i dont use any social media other than masturbation material so im good in that    alright guess ill read 20 newspapers a day
  is an actual apartheid ocurring in israel  yes  is climate change that fucked up  more than what is reported  is communism actually good  yes  where to get questions on this shit  all over the internet  like unbiased news sources  such a thing does not exist
your only option is to learn as much as possible from a variety of sources and come to your own conclusions but here are my relatively educated views  is an actual apartheid ocurring in israel  i dont think this is hidden in any way  is climate change that fucked up  if there is any honest scientific progress on the matter its obfuscated by lies similar to many other fields where there is a lot of money on the line see psychology pharm however you can rest assured that all that would happen with significant climate change is shifts in the temperate zones which is what has pretty much always happened in significant shifts in climate denmark becomes a world superpower again because greenland is suddenly viable for farming and mining operations  is communism actually good  communism isnt possible even small hippie communes cant manage to emulate it let alone nations the argument of its inevitability relies on reificative bases i cant take it seriously
multiple sources understanding how to separate fact from feelings and also knowing that feelings and fact can be one and the same honestly i cant be bothered to type anything else out because nothing will actually go through your heads most people come to the conclusion they want to hear not what they need to hear what it is is not always what you want it doesnt care about you in the slightest
   guess ill read 20 newspapers a day  aint nobody got time for that shit on most issues you can just watch bbc news and fake it like everyone else who claims to be informed       are you an atmospheric physicist didnt think so
yes  yes  yes  read multiple news sources critically and be aware of their biases

hi
what has he been doing the last few years its like he vanished
just shitposting as usual  i wonder if he can still ban people
fucking smoking hot google plus sluts and getting mad high off google plus ganja in his google plus penthouse
google fed him to the pigs
he was supposed to revitalize google but instead there was a massive data breach and now its being shut down
  i heard he wipes his ass with 100 bills because hes so rich now
  its like he vanished  im pretty sure thats what he wanted his creation warped before his eyes
  he works at google in area 120 and thats about all we know  
  what has he been doing the last few years
the guy who ripped off a jap site and got away with it literally fucking who
  he ran off and wants nothing more to do with this awful fucking website  we should do the same
  he took all the money and ran to mexico
he killed himself
  area 120  thats a pretty sweet gig
  imagine people trying to get him involved whenever the mods do something they dont like
  literally getting pegged by katie formerly kyle at google for minimum wage
  yeah thats totally the reason why its getting shut down
disappeared
  hes in a goolag

did you mean niggers
    woah
damn thing is an auroch not a cow
how many hamburgers can you make out of knickers

i want to eat knickers
hes delicious
  anon thats just a normal cow with a lot of tiny cows around her
what is the perfect list of boards for an imageboard  please take care not to embarrass yourself with normalfag board suggestions
/b/
can we suggest a few and build upon others  video games board  anime/manga board  random board  sfw random board  programming board
  is it really necessary to separate sfw and nonsfw
  yes some people just want to take it easy and not be surrounded by horny teens though the horny teens themselves can be entertaining and full of energy so not having an nsfw version would be stupid
an imageboard should start with one board and only add more once the original board becomes too crowded
  unthemed miscellaneous boards always go to shit
/lol/ the main board depends on your theme of the site  /int/  /feels/  /s/  /lit/  /film/  /a/  /meta/  /trash/  too many boards will fragment your site
/h2o/  hydration center  /cc/  calorie corner  /ce/  cooking equipment  /fa/  floral arrangement  /sk/  skits  comedic plays  /i/  introductions
  pick one
/a/  /sfw random/  /lit/  /prog/  /v/  /jp/
  the theme is anime weve been over this
  for how long especially with that name
/pol/  /r9k/  /int/  /adv/  /soc/  /lgbt/  /fa/
id like to see more anonymous imageboards trying out tags instead of boards there are some but theyre mostly russian right now
  too many
  its a general format on most decent sized imageboards not talking about jp spinoffs im talking foriegn chans like 55chan ylil kc
itt unusual or interesting things on boards you visit      meme magic at work
wheres the popthreads pic heresy
stickies    
  false thread
janitor protected a blatant offtopic trap thread in /v/ until a mod moved it to /cgl/        mods need to investigate who lets these threads up ive seen similar threads in the past where a janitor lets them up after deleting other offtopic threads or even deleting individual posts in these threads while leaving them up
  so a guy from /k/ fucked a deer
two threads
  again
  ive read through this thread  pretty good
an has a meme     
  is /an/ the most boring board
  theres an spic janitor who let subhumans shit up the board they usually ignore reports
  not as hot as the first one little lame desu
  spic  gb2/4chan/
called it  they cant have one of those threads without some nsfw images  every single time       
  thanks for pointing it out i was looking for something to fap to
  boring is the new exciting anon
   cowboy bebop now officially /tv/
  what are the chances of it being ruined theyre not planning on replacing characters with blacks or homosexuals are they or making spike into a strong independent woman who dont need no man
  what the fuck is going on in that thread has lee finally snapped completely
  its netflix what do you think
  i think netflix sucks
  every time ive ever tried to willfully summon barneyfag to a thread they i either took over an hour or never appeared at all regardless of board    yet this time they respond within 4 fucking minutes of op posting    bullshit im not going to say this is all an inside joke but theres definitely more than meets the eye to all this
thread watcher is fucked and i dont know how to fix it  shits frozen in the same place from when gookmoot decided to fuck everything up for his shekels
/m/ made a funny  
  i cant vouch for the veracity of this but theres supposedly an argentinian guy who emails barneyfag whenever he posts stealth ponies
  considering it is kill on /cgl/ deleting the thread altogether might have been a better idea
  heres hoping that it can be at least on par with death note
so its been a few days  has anyone with any of those stat trackers noticed any increase/decrease in posting since the move to 4channel or has it stayed about the same
  dont see much of a difference in /v/
    /pol/ decreased a bit after the split probably because the majority of shitposters were banned during that day
  /an/ is pretty funny
bbut the last reply from feedback was x years ago    what now 
  whom quoteth
    what now faggot
  fixed as soon as you posted
  its still there for me on 4channel i even tried to open it in ie to ensure its not cached on my machine  though maybe its cached somewhere on cloudflare
    did developer lad leave or something why bother doing this
  how is /vp/ not a red board again
/biz/ is being spammed for some reason
two big pony threads on /g/ first was deleted second has been up for close to 2 hours
bump
lees been at it for over a week how does he do it hes been banevading for years 
  i have to wonder just how many ips he and his copycats have fed to the blacklist for free over his retarded crusade
  i missed it   whats going on again
  /an/ can be pretty great from time to time
  anons sister is dead and he never could play club penguin with her
0o  
hes doing it again
/qa/ is being spammed
  shit i was on /co/ too but had no idea what this was so just skimmed past it looks like fun
  seems staged    205218    205300    at the most 000042 passed between it being posted and the ban
  that just means a mod was watching shrek
  outing yourself as a newfag
/tv/ is basically another /pol/ colony by this point its pretty fucking cringeworthy  
testing
2472227  nice bait
  based jannie
do you remember if there was report option of flame war
  they are discussing it retard
  nothing new they pull this shit all the time  mods have admitted in the past they actively allow shitposters to disrupt /v/ uncontested at times because they hate the board and think its funny when it gets shitposted to death
  what was that post
  use 4chan x faggot
  that option is only on a few boards
  /a/ mod moves peru el oniichan magazine thread to s4s
  why was this locked was it moved here or something
  oh its just a spinoff guy having a meltdown i though it was something important            no idea why the mod is locking these instead of just deleting them though
  why do i get the feeling that its actually you who is from a spinoff
why was this locked 
  ask yourself that how should i know
im rangebanned from posting threads on /qa/  yet the weebshits arent  explain yourselves mods
  its more hiros fault if anything sorry man
  oh its that guy who did the cleansing every week or so by spamming the board to the point of there being only 10 to 20 threads once he was done     i had hoped he was permabanned
fuck the jnnies
  they deleted them now i noticed
  thats rude  t the jnnies
  flipping basted
well  is about to/already happened   thats something
  bruh check your post number we are not even close to that number
  oops meant 
  well  was disappointing
    underwhelming but it sorts of fits current /co/
  at least 100000000 was 10/10 that almost everyone agreed deserved it
george bush is dead  sticky on /pol/ id imagine
  s
  good get very /co/ 8/10
/mu/ shitposts into oblivion   
  most people on /pol/ dont even know who that is
someones been posting cp on /tv/ again
      based yotsubaposter
  this thread had surprising quality
  /v/s a lot more talented than i thought
  can you post some lesbob furry stuff or would that be for another board lol furrytrash
  you can never take this post back anon
  what was it i missed
  you could always use the archives anon
  i believe it was something along the lines of these comics are great thanks for posting them     pure innocent and able to apply to the board as a whole
  janitors dont give a shit about fucking /v/ unless its videogames being posted or cp
  
  moderation here is the absolute worst at getting rid of kids jerking each other off they are going to be the ones to get this domain blacklisted
  and thats a good thing
  because horrible discussion/content is also good for the userbase it doesnt matter if youre serious or not your retarded approach to the quality of the website is the poison that kills it
  and heres why with a bit of butthurt
so this happened    in a nutshell it is the current aaa game people from /v/ are expecting to fail partially because it is very in your face with diversity like mass effect andromeda during the presentation a bunch of comments showed up on the screen some people are claiming they got hacked while others think it is intentional and an attempt at baiting people with manufactured outrage take it with a grain of salt
  in your face with diversity  diversity is good
  why
  the marginalized groups gets to be represented
  ill laugh if this was hacking  ill laugh if the company thought that manufacturing this outrage was a good idea    no matter what i still win
  its pretty clearly mocking the people who criticized the game
/bant/ finally has a newspaper again   
excitement in /v/ as jontron uploads his first video in nearly 1 year
baste song about hiro from /bant/    
  excitement  its only one thread and half of the posts are shitting on op for making an eceleb thread
  eceleb  into the trash
  eceleb
  not bad 6/10
  /v/ seems extra garbage right now surely the teens and bored college kids dont get holiday break this early now
  its been that way since smash got announced
  how can one subset of posters remain so consistently epic
all i wanted was to enjoy a discussion about shana like back in the day but the psycho bursted in for some reason    
      its ok when ecleb i like is posted
  whomstdve doth quoteth
  oh fuck off   avgn  cx game center
  who quote
  /v/ never talks about gccx anymore
  nice time machine bro can i borrow it
      ok fags what about jerma
month old thread in /vr/ got archived didnt even reach 200 posts but oh well was a good thread while it lasted
  not a happening if you want people to relate then at least provide a link
  month old  hardly a happening
      error you cannot delete this post  fuck this board and fuck all of you
  he doesnt know
  oh i do know people secretly bumping threads and then deleting posts straight afterwards im still mad
  people  bots arent people
  hey alright
someone is raiding /g/ with apple spam  there are another 6 spam threads with a different title
shipper flood on /a/
  special kind of autism
its okay to overprices are shit   
tumblr is flatout banning porn in two weeks /trash/ isnt happy      
  good we can be miserable together
  someone  apple
is anyone else getting this shit
  yes
  did it also appear during last 30min or so for you
  well it wasnt there for me before that
  its an ad
    yep expect more malware ads
  damn hiro is really going at it kind of funny desu
i dont check very often but pretty sure this one is a new addition
  implying they werent already
  yes i know that gook is doing some evil
  waiting on this
      i think i found the cause apparently hiro got away with the domain change trick
google ads bois
    hot dog did hiro pull it off
where were you when hiro saved 4channel
/qa/ gets listed  /qa/ gets ads  /qa/ doesnt get a banner
  also no jannitor  and no board specific 
  our janny is a mod  and the rules are arbitrary with no way to appeal
   gets listed  only in the mobile version for some reason
  i think there is an argument to be made that the ban appeal process is wheather or not you can ban evade
  it was like that the first day it was preprepared must be just be cycling through new ads now
  surprising but good unless you want your website to be a porn website dont allow pornography jerk off somewhere else
have you ever wondered what a research paper on /sp/ would look like    wonder no more   this unironically exists
acks at it again   ctrl f deleted   1/283   
an underage generaltard posted ancient irc memes in the happenings thread
  seeing all this shit described in such a dry manner is hilarious
  we still need a 4cc team
  we  wrong site shithead    go to archives and check hiros thread on /qa/ about the site split it has hundres of posts discussing these news and wishing hiro death but there were two groups who didnt even care about such major event and instead tried to spam the thread with their requests pedos asking for /l/ board and 4chan cup faggots asking to have their generals on every board     on that day i learned that in terms of obnoxiousness 4chan cup faggots are on the same level as ban evading loli spammers
    i dont want a 4cc general on every board i just want the ability to have a thread when my board has a game
  but there were two groups who didnt even care about such major event  the people camped out in the sticky are hardly /qa/ regulars of the normal variety /qa/ on the whole doesnt hate hiro even half as much as the sticky would make you think
  its just bizarre someone took the time to not only look into this but write it all up as well
is that true
england doesnt exist outside of london fuck this shithole country and thank god for brexit
  fuck london full of neoliberal subhuman trash  the midlands is the best part ignore yorkshire shills
  t paki
just 3 active threads allowed  when did this change
the weebs screwed it up with their spam
once again the actions of a malicious few spurred the mods into fucking /qa/ in the ass
  it happened right before the split
3 active threads on what board what treads
  all this does is harm static ip users dynamic ip users can just switch ips and make an infinite number of threads
  at the same time it has made it more difficult for spammers
i wrote 1600 words today  what does /qa/ do that isnt just shitposting
i write 10000 word posts on reddit every week
i gave up and settled for less
occasionally meta threads or study japanese
  that is not productive
i go to the gym and run just about every day
  cool
a redditobsessed man with the mind of a small child
maybe il do something productive later
  eat a dick anime girl
  go back on reddit
  why are you such a faggot
taking it easy lately
  why not do something fun
  like what
  like write a story draw do something productive
what would be some good additions/changes to 4chanx for myself id like to see and option to enable/disable the index/catalog auto updating as itd probably save me time id spend updating them manually
just let me shift click posts  clicking the minus is too much effort
sometimes i think it would be nice to be able to change the color of individual threads in the watcher  or even just stick an asterisk next to them or something
  catalog autoupdating has been on the todo list for a long time pull requests welcome for index autoupdating wed have to figure out how to do it without annoyingly shuffling around threads as youre trying to read them      odd for me clicking the minus is easier although i guess the shift click would be faster if you were hiding a large number of posts      yeah the purpose of the thread watcher has gotten mixed between threads youre especially interested in and threads where you just want to see if somebody replies you although i like the idea of two or more lists perhaps separated by a horizontal rule      oneechan/stylechan probably does that already
how can we make pull requests easier for people
i was thinking a mark all as read for the thread watcher would be nice
  go pull your dick faggot
  do you often end up with every thread on your watcher being read without them being marked as read on your watcher
  yes for me its a common occurence because ill see the most recent replies to a thread in my watcher via the catalog reply preview and it doesnt update it also im sure thatd be a pain in the ass to actually implement
  maybe the right thing to do is have looking at the replies in the catalog update the watcher
  if you can do it then yeah thatd be ideal
  a lot of the code recently added for the unread line in index thing can probably be reused
  so if you see me acting strangely
  my true identity
  yeah the purpose of the thread watcher has gotten mixed between threads youre especially interested in and threads where you just want to see if somebody replies you although i like the idea of two or more lists perhaps separated by a horizontal rule  somewhat related 
one tiny issue i have is that when you get a connection error and cooldowns disabled you need to click post agains and it doesnt auto retry
  i was thinking about that a week ago being able to reorganize threads would be nice    change the value of   blockquote  spanquote  color 6b8e10   to whatever color you want
need a button to downvote posts
  i should probably learn to use it but an emulated clover client is just too comfy
  im the opposite i have 4chan x installed on my phone
  same no idea how clover looks or works but i doubt itd look/function better than 4chanx does
  im using violentmonkey in firefox tampermonkey would probably work too
  post got away from me before typing my comment      also need to fix the issue where it retries indefinitely on connection error can cause you to get banned if you dont stop it
autorefresh for the catalog its pretty annoying to click on a thread just to find out its archived because i forgot to refresh the catalog for the last 30 minutes    i tried using a browser autorefresh extension but then if i forget to turn that off while writing out a new thread itll autorefresh the entire page causing me to lose what i wrote so it turns into a game of whats the least frustrating    on the user side its fairly easy to click on so it seems like something thatd be easy to implement but i dont know how to program these scripts to know exactly what problems youd run into    pic related is the event script i got from inspecting the element
  i had the same idea already  sadly you cant monkeypatch user extensions as they run as anonymous enclosures within the page context this also means elementclick doesnt work here 4chan x only exports code in the global namespace to interface with the native 4chan extension to support oekaki
  i had the same idea already  oh sorry shouldve read the thread its been suggested for years now so i thought it was a forgotten suggestion      for index autoupdating wed have to figure out how to do it without annoyingly shuffling around threads as youre trying to read them  how about it updates once when the tab comes into focus so whenever you switch from a thread tab to the catalog tab itll update once maybe also give it a hotkey enable/disable
  just geet an android apple sucks
  elementclick doesnt work here  should work fine
  how about it updates once when the tab comes into focus so whenever you switch from a thread tab to the catalog tab itll update once maybe also give it a hotkey enable/disable  it might work although sometimes i do a onceover of the index while occasionally opening and switching to threads and that could interfere with it
i have literally never used 4chan x or any similar extension im not a purist or anything i just never bothered    to those that do what am i missing out on and why should i start using it convince me its worth it
  and before that i was using usi i dont remember why it stopped working
well its going to need an update for the domain change
  should be pretty straightforward
  i wonder how long the transition period will be
  enable the script on 4channelorg  fix all links generated by 4chan x to point to the correct board
  wait looks like no changes are needed at all    unless someone wants to have the option to use 4channel added as a feature  dont see much motivation to do so though
  id like to pin individual threads on my own not just watched threads
  issue  
  how does captcha treat you
will noscript captcha still work after the initial release of v3 or will everyone be forced to use the new system
  i never got the point of separate lists
  that depend entirely on how its set up on 4chans end
why isnt there a post counter  i want to for example be able to see what the 300th reply was
  might depend on whether youve jailbroken it
  depends
  i think you can do that with custom css
    heres a quick one i came up with    body   counterreset reply    thread  postcontainer  replybefore   position absolute  counterincrement reply  content counterreply      put that in advanced  custom css    you can probably tweak it to look better  references to understand this      i put in the thread  postcontainer   part to avoid counting inline quotes
  you can do a lot with custom css
  i think you can do that with custom css
is anything broken on 4chanorg yet
  why would it be
  ive heard some posts about it redirecting to 4channelorg already but apparently thats about urls like 
i keep seeing reports of people talking about things not working but everything works fine for me on 4chanorg
  okay now having actually read the thread it sounds like he is going to host the worksafe boards only on 4channel and 4chan will have links to both i dont know why the hell he is talking about javascript and frames though
is there any eta on when itll be ready for 4channel
    one persons answer from a while back for why they wanted this  in native pinning shows how many new posts are made on that thread you have pinned on the catalog so you dont need to open watched threads for that i also use pinned threads to look at threads that are currently around while watched threads is most of the time filled with dead threads so i can find them again later    although the unread count part we could just have 4chan x show in the catalog for watched threads  and only live threads on the watcher are pinned if the pin watched threads option is turned on
reminder to anyone saying 4chan x is broken by the change to just change the url from 4channel to 4chan it will be made to work on 4channel also in due time
  ctrlenter to post  that alone is the way to go
  it could be implemented by itself in a userscript of a few lines but i imagine there are a lot of other little things you like
what would be a good indication of a thread in the catalog with new replies not necessarily a watched thread
  true i have a js that checks the page threads are on and displays them in the thread watcher for instance  the new ip marker is nice too
  when i get to it i havent been treating it as urgent because you can still use 4chanorg just fine
  just make sure the switch doesnt catch you off guard
an option to bring back the oneclick report tool      
4chanx have nothing to do with the native extension idiotssan
  true i have a js that checks the page threads are on and displays them in the thread watcher for instance  thats a nice one  
4channel is here  hopefully we can get 4chanx working there soon
and now its forced 4channel  2450575  any idea on when it should be ready
  i havent been treating it as urgent because you can still use 4chanorg just fine    just make sure the switch doesnt catch you off guard  feelio when
  yep
  werks for me   get fucked
  its updated now
ccd0 if youre in this thread is there any way to donate to you  i really appreciate the excellent work youve done with maintaining and improving this extension over the years
  no i havent set anything like that up
  did that bring up the report window when clicked
  who implied it did
restore the full header
  yeah would be good for us pass idiots also if i recall correctly i used a fork in the past which would embed the report window directly in the site instead of a popup
  was it ihavenofaces
  yeah i think so his version was pretty unique at the time
  im going to have to update a lot of little scripts like this for myself hopefully it goes smoothly
  i think i remember seeing that when i ported the embed window from his fork i think it used some common code
bumpf
  maybe there could be sections and you could drag threads between sections
   cont  what would be a good interface for putting a thread in a certain category when you watched it maybe have clicking the heart / altclicking in the catalog rotate between categories instead of being just an on/off
someone is maintaining oneechan again    
  fuck off kevin
  yeah fuck you kevin
  whats the advantage of oneechan over simple css tools like stylus
  not having to learn css i assume
what about a sage button like press ctrlkey to add and remove sage from the options
  alts
  huh never knew about that thats convenient
will there be any further work done on making 4chanx compatible for other imageboards
especially having a unified crossboard thread watcher would be very nice
    thats the plan
  other imageboards  id be happy if it was compatible with just cripplechan other chans are so dead theyre basically irrelevant  right now something works but it lacks the proper custom catalog and other things so i cant just disable all site javascript and browse with 4chanxs js like i do here
  other chans are so dead theyre basically irrelevant  thats why i think that making 4chanx compatible with them would be a great idea bring over what people like and possibly give them encouragement to post on other imageboards as well as 4chan so that things in the future may be more spread out and there could be more than just 4chan and 8gag maybe acting on that old idea of giving people a little nudge may not be too bad an idea though if ccd0 does go about it then i think he should ask the owners if theyre ok with it first because i know some like to be their own secret club
also 4chanxs language is coffeescriptdead and who wants to work with that  theres a plan to transition to es6 but i havent worked on it much    some of the issues with decaffeinate seem to be resolved now though so it should be easier at this point  wed still want to make sure transitioning to es6 doesnt kill support in some of the browsers people are using like pale moon we could compile to older js with babel but the main reason i want to switch to es6 is so i can take out the compilation step    if you want to help with it it should be possible to just convert one of the coffee files and rename it to js the conversion and renaming should be separate commits so that its easier for git to track the file history the main work is making sure things arent broken after the conversion including in the obscure browsers
  it was pretty similar to mayhems but he had added a few features that werent in any of the other forks
  one of my biggest problems with oneechan is the fraction of a second that my css sometimes gets disabled when switching pages i wonder if thats a problem with the script itself or something else since ive noticed it affecting separate userscript managers differently
  thats a fundamental problem with user scripts theres three different run times for them to fire when the page just has started loading and looks like html/html to the browser when the page has been parsed completely and all scripts have started and when all resources on the page have loaded and with the latter two you cant avoid the brief white flash while stylesheets are swapped out the former is harder to program though as you have to observe every html element as the browser parses it and add/change your own stylesheets before it begins layouting the page around them
  working now
  i quit using it when i switched to vivaldi its too slow to load compared to stylus it takes about a second it worked better on firefox
  how much of the css it generates is the same for every pageload it might be possible to have it generate the css and copypaste it into stylus
  maybe acting on that old idea of giving people a little nudge may not be too bad an idea  that more or less evolved into imageboardsjson and the plan to add compatibility with other imageboards    if ccd0 does go about it then i think he should ask the owners if theyre ok with it first  when multisite is good enough perhaps we can add a few other imageboards to the default include list
  how much work would you say would need to be done to have 4chanx fully functional with other sites or at least ones using vichan or similar
  this    works with current 4chanx code is already made it would just be a matter of copypasting and editing a new checkbox into the settings panel  i personally have some css adjustments to the thread watcher but it should work even without them
  well to get a rough idea    has a list of the features of 4chan x at the bottom and    shows things currently disabled on tinyboard because they dont work yet
  all of it i think because even the background flashes
  when the page just has started loading and looks like html/html to the browser  chromes shitty extension system recently adopted by firefox and edgesplorer makes this difficult to implement in userscript engines
i was wondering would there be any possible collaboration with the alternative site people are thinking of to try and make it compatible with 4chanx or will we just need to wait until after its up to see any sort of integration
4chanx is already compatible with several popular opensource imageboard software packages so as long as it uses one of them it will work outofthebox
  contributions welcome
  just tinyboard and derivatives for now
  there will be  no guarantee of pace
  thats fine as long as there will be
reeee this is still broken 4channel and 4chan threads will appear again even if removed
  its super shitty the only work around is to use http to visit 4channel and  for all 4chan visits this will keep your watchers separate but functional
am i the only one who isnt having problems with this my thread watcher works fine
  do you watch threads from both 4chan and 4channel simultaneously
file a bug report on the feedback page
  fuck with your cookie settings thats what i did
  no most people dont have issues with the thread watcher      all you need to do is not be a brainlet and configure your adblocker or ublock or umatrix or whatever other privacy extension you use to whitelist 4chanorg and 4channelorg on both domains so 4chan can communicate with 4channel and vice versa
solve ur own problems faggot  also check allow third party cookies
  cookies did not fix
both 4chan and 4channel whitelisted  works like shit
my 4chan x isnt working you dumb faggots what do i do

maybe i should all give you the talk on lesbians    they are the most detrimental thing to society they disrupt the grand justice of the universe  you see when god made men and women  god knew that women would have it a 100x easier in dating and pretty much all aspects in life  so god needed to find a way to make life as a woman as awful as being a man    and just like that god made every single male in the world ugly i mean lets be honest men are ugly theres nothing remotely attractive about men whats hot to a woman is jamal or brad pitt clone 8752 thats it  imagine a life where you were not attracted to your waifu asian girls or cosplay girls and instead you woke up attracted to a man  thats the life a woman must live as punishment for having it easier in just about everything  their punishment is being forced to always like the ugliness of guys  it balances out the universe    but then  the lesbians happened  and you homos let the lesbians happen  lesbians can not exist women should not be allowed how pleasurable the female body is because they already have it too easy  they should be forbidden from knowing such a thing    and that is why i hate dykes  they disrupt the balance of life  stop  posting  lesbians

  kill yourself sneedfag
go back there
if someone makes a thread and then there are thirty replies all the same word and you report those oneword repeated posts as spam why are they never deleted is it because there are literally thirty people all saying the exact same word    is it not really pointless spam if more than 20 people are doing it
  meanwhile 
  theyve made an agreement with hiro that generals can be phased out completely
sneed
  wtf so the mods are based
each day /tv/ strays further and further from gods light
  even if i dont like donald trump why
  link better mong  
i wish we could have comfy actress/actor threads on /tv/ again
/film/ again when
  this sneed shit is blatant spamming why is it just being ignored
is it really forbidden now to even say write the word nigger without any racist context just nigger ive got my post deleted because i corrected someone who censored themself with nword
depends on the board and your opinions if you post an opinion that a mod/janny doesnt like they can remove your posts and cite racism as the reason
  who cares nigger just bandodge lmao  mods have been well known to be unironic faggots since like 2010 at least
i sure hope so it really drags down the quality of discussion
i said that the genesis was for niggers on /vr/ get it because its black and an sjw mod gave me three and a half days

are there actually non weebs who want to use this board is that why people keep saying weeb spam/mafia
the majority of 4chan are not weebs and this is the 4chan meta board so do the math
are there actually non weebs who want to use this board  yes the natives
  the majority of 4chan are not weebs  those are just our guests
its a long story lurk more
  the natives  so people who are here for moots qa session
  who is our  inb4 weeb mafia
  those who petitioned for this board to stay
  people who love 4chan meta

why do /fa/ and /mu/ feel so differently from other boards
they are full of hipsters
theyre boards about specific hobbies which require niche knowledge to enjoy above a normalfag level which most of the posters are
contrarianism and   compare /mu/ and /tv/ when theyre not talking about planes or shitposting on how they take their hobbies and youll get the difference
  different in what way
  they talk about fashion and music no other boards do that as much as them
  i wouldnt expect other boards to talk about fashion and/or music all that much and thats probably a good thing
its because most of the posters there have an autistic dedication for being artistic the good posters on /fa/ are the kind of people who have spent tons and money and time developing their own personal style and have the confidence to make it a part of their lifestyle good posters on /mu/ will have usually one genre that they know everything about and have listened to hundreds of albums in that genre
actual teenboards instead of boards where 1923 year olds call everyone they dont like teens
    because op /mu/ and /fa/ are boards for the wellrounded citizen
  infested with normalfags and outsiders    proof ratio of tripfags to anons is really high
  tfw 25 yo  havent outgrown 4chan yet
  i bet the proportion of females/males is much higher there also
/mu/ has the most underage userbase on 4chan
  pretty sure thats /b/

what are some good snacks to eat while watching anime about to plow through some of my backlog but i need something to crmunch on while watching

op is a mutt
ice cream and cheetos
microwaved popcorn
  roasted peanuts whats in your backlog by the way
  what i usually go for
tea with something sweet like cookies or cake  might go make some now actually

watching old anime is kind of depressing i feel bad for all the seiyuus that dont get roles anymore
i dont think them receiving less roles is all that depressing since it may just mean they dont want as many or are busy doing other things though whats really depressing is watching most old shaft works since they love to stick to their pool of seiyuus for most of their shows especially older i always know that ill eventually hear one golden voice ill never hear again
  still hurts tbdesu
  it hurts bros
whos your favorite seiyuu
  斎藤 千和
  good choice
  oniisammaaa
  deviously evil
  花澤 香菜  dont think ive ever disliked a single one of her roles and her sadistic voice is perfect
  which of her roles did you like the best
  上田 麗奈 shes got crazy range and can still act well while doing weird voices
  松来未祐 such a sweet voice always looked forward to her roles
  小倉唯  her voice is the only one i can instantly recognize and her characters are often my favorite
  matsuoka yuki
  i really hope she gets more big roles after the success of gridman i think that akane is her best performance yet
  the ones that currently stick out in my mind are kuroneko nadeko marimo satou and raphi
  i disagree i think her work in pripara was some of the most stand out work ive ever heard from a va since she had 43 characters in that and had to bounce between her normal voice her normal voice but deeper a baby and someone who does mounds of speed
love lovely voices
sad
  then dont watch old trash

delete /pol/ /v/ and /r9k/  ban pepe and wojak  ban any and all antianime posters  bring back the cuck wordfilter  remove gr13  add /gaz/  gazpacho discussion
didnt know sprite cranberry was a thing  i feel my life just changed
permaban this poster ban anime and rename 4chan into polchan
ban everything i dont like immediately1
  keep /v/ merge /r9k/ and /pol/ restrict pepe to the end result and ban anyone that steps out of line with extreme prejudice  also do add /gaz/
  this but unironically
2473286  imposter
  delete /pol/ /v/ and /r9k/  what are /pol/ and /r9k/ i dont see them in the list of boards  ban pepe and wojak  why bother they will only find another  ban any and all antianime posters  sounds like someone wants a hug box have you tried tumblr  remove gr13  never  add /gaz/  gazpacho discussion  best idea ive seen in years
i have read the rules and it says anything from 1999 downwards but when will games from the 2000s and right now be given the title retro and allowed to be discussed here  is it when they reach around 20 years old 
  /vr/ just sets its own rules 2000 forward will never be retro
    blame the ps2 for dragging itself into the obama administration 2004 feels vaguely retro 2009 does not
  never
  we just had this thread last week
iirc according to /qa/ it just boils down to /vr/ not really needing any new content
  just make it based on year not console how hard is that
  we just had this thread today  
and this is the problemn64 games released from january 2000 onwards arent allowed
  well what was the answer
go on /a/    call someone a normie instead of normalfag    space out my greentext like this    they go fucking nuclear from this alone    why is a selfproclaimed board of oldfags so fucking easy to work into a seethe its literally the easiest board to bait outside of /pol/tards
ignoring that behavior would make it seem acceptable to others
  but why are you so obsessed with convention this desire to pretend like /a/ is some last bastion of 4chan purity is laughable especially considering how many cancerous template threads and battle shonen generals are right under your nose 2008 /a/ would be disgusted with 2018 /a/ but not for the reasons that you and your little hall monitor buddies think
  like i give a fuck
kids trying to fit in nothing else its not like they can discuss anime without bickering and posting their first sexual fantasies when mom is not watching
  i can feel your seethe from here
go on /a/  someone posts a screenshot of a very popular and recognizable anime  reply sauce  350 angry replies  get banned  sirens start blaring in the distance
  /a/ is basically like /v/ at this point the lastcremnants of old /a/ are completely gone and the few that still try to fight back will give up eventually the reason why they start seething is they try to stop even more cancer to become accpeted but in my opinion its a lost fight not worth fighting anymore
make a shitpost on /a/  get range banned right away  wow lame
  die teen
  thats not advertiser friendly 
  self proclaimed  literally the first board to exist  allowing off site refugee to infect a countrys culture  frogposting  literally making your text a pain in the arse to read  stupid libtard plebbitor nobody likes you
go on hima  call someone aanything instead of norm or xer  use punctuation and quote functions like this  they go fucking nuclear from this alone  why is a selfproclaimed board of retarded bloggers so fucking easy to work into a seethe its literally the easiest board to bait    i know i made this but its kind of inaccurate now modern hima actively parodies old hima and /jp/
  how many people who browsed /a/ in 2003 do you think still browse /a/ in 2018    id wager less than a dozen if any at all
   the first board to exist  /b/ was before /a/ i believe
  /a/  board of oldfags when they just keep reposting twitter like /v/ or erp in their generals  wew lad
   the first board to exist  /b/ was first board on the site but yeah it was anime/random /a/ was created month or so later
  i agree whenever some fag use normie i get so fucking ass blassted
4chan didnt get popular for /a/
    and yet youre still here dont project that twinkling of your personal reason for still using this imageboard which you resent on to others
  anime fans are fragile as fuck
  someone you dont like comes looking for attention  give them exactly what they want  you are half the cancer
  literally the first board to exist        inception /b/  10/02/2003 /h/  10/06/2003 1am est /c/ and /d/  10/06/2003 8pm est /y/  10/09/2003 /g/ the original /g/ guro and /s/  11/08/2003 /a/ and /l/ lolikon    this is a matter of public record /a/ wasnt even close to being the first board on this website it was the joint eighth     /b/ was anime/random for over a month before /a/ was created and it became simply random    i have no understanding of why people literally make this shit up
  i dont think ive seen a real oldfag on /a/ since 2009ish ive seen it slowly decline since 2006 with things really going south around 2008ish i put this down to the fact that 2007 was the last communal year for anime on 4chan and the wider internet as a whole youre probably aware that in the early days of 4chan most people on most boards were connected with anime culture somehow well 20062007 was a very popular time for anime all over the internet weeb culture was at a peak lots of anime and manga was being published and printed in english and the anime of these years was hugely popular too death note ttgl lucky star haruhi etc which meant that /a/ had a highly diverse userbase from different boards and different places on the internet     around 2008 not only was /b/s secret club culture spreading to other parts of 4chan but also many people had dropped off the anime wagon the years series werent captivating people as much as 20062007s did and so /a/ became more insular and the new era of /b/tards formed an elitistdriven community where the overall tone was were better than everyone else couple this with the /jp/ split and /a/ just became an unpleasant place to be and drove away most oldfags who didnt really care for secret club games and just wanted to discuss anime    not long after in the early 2010s more animestyled games began creeping into the west and so /v/ became part of the picture weighing in on anime culture with its opinions mainly stating that late 90s toonami anime was the only worthwhile anime and everything else was trash this of course drove /a/ further down a contrarian tunnel where anything older than the mid 2000s was treated with suspicion out of fear of attracting people from /v/    divisions between era taste studio and genre popped up everywhere everyone was paranoid that the people on the board didnt belong there /a/ board cultured itself into a corner
   angry replies   banned   start blaring in the distance  somebody actually saged reported called the cops
  /b/ was anime/random  i have no understanding of why people literally make this shit up  something something 2chan flipside board ie nsfw /a/ you do know why /b/ is called /b/ or /d/ or /k/ or etc board right redditor
  lets say no please enlighten me then
  what youve said is correct id be interested to see how he explains himself here
i always found it funny that they catered to the hardcore crowd on /a/ with rules like no recommendations    it made it elitist anime faggot central and sucked any fresh blood out of the place    now its just say something nice about her    fuck anime for real
  why is a selfproclaimed board of oldfags so fucking easy to work into a seethe  if it keeps the dumb frog posters away then is nothing wrong with that
  thanks obama
work into a seethe    jabroni
  this    i didnt even watch anime when i came to this website i do now though
  ironically its this websites shitty taste that kept me from getting into anime for so long id ask for recs and people would say bebop texhnolyze ergo proxxy lain ttgl fma gits boring garbage i tried hard to get into it too wasnt til a few years ago with escaflowne that i saw the potential of the medium and now im surrounded by plastic chicks and dakimakura
  this new seething meme is really terrible just because someone replies to you to point out youre wrong or in this case that youre a newfag who should lurk more before posting doesnt mean theyre seething     this meme is literally just u mad all over again anyone you dont agree with can be dismissed as mad and it means noone changes their behaviour or learns anything     obviously a lot of /a/ is fucking shit now but at least the userbase has tried to maintain board quality and encourage people to do shit for themselves and become more knowledgeable posters over the years thats why its not as shit as /v/     of course there have been unnecessary levels of elitism that came along with that but thats preferable to not telling people to lurk more catering to rec threads which if allowed would bump actually discussion off the board etc because then there are no sociocultural barriers to entry whatsoever and the place gets flooded with idiots and our culture is lost forever if you point out to someone they are misusing the nomenclature it may oust them as an outsider in one thread but it helps them in the long run because they can learn thats not to say we should go around pointing out mistakes constantly  we shouldnt its just a recipe for derailing threads and again i am aware it is overdone  but it needs to be done once in a while to try and maintain the quality of the board or everything will truly go to shit in a bigger way than it already has    inb4 all the inevitable seething replies etc
  seething  e  e  t  h  i  n  g
  seeyhing newfag go back to le reddit
  deranged retard spend more than an hour on /a/ before making a post like this they dont preserve the culture anymore they try to assimilate any deviants to their discord style chatroom
  nu/a/  preserving culture  lole
  hey im not deranged    i do kind of agree though because posters that care about board quality do now seem to be in the minority we need to purge those fucking discord kiddies i am convinced they are the same obnoxious posters who derail threads into role play shit as well i dont know if /a/ is salvageable at this point honestly but i have to believe we will find a way because i have nowhere else to go
  if you show you have any feeling for a board or this site as a whole you get laughed at and told to fuck off because of le irony xdddd  sad but what can be done about it
  i should have expected replies this like in addition to the seething ones but i hope its quite as bad as you make it seem because there are still some of us who care or well see my post here       very true this website has been like an outline home for me for over a decade now i may venture out and see other places but i always come back just like an actual home you accept that things about it naturally change over time but you still want to the keep the parts that make it worth coming back to
  still waiting for a reply
someone from tumblr posts on another board  just go back to tumblr already  someone from another board posts on /a/  why are you telling me to go back  how are the other boards any different from /a/
  each 4chan board has its own culture so posting in the style of another board is only a more local version of posting in the style of another website
    only newfags talk about reddit retard
  i dont know if /a/ is salvageable at this point  its to late now personally after 12 years on /a/ i finally gave up
  only this websites death will vindicate bitter elitists like me this userbase is overdue to for a long needed real schism nothing like that 8ch shit
  unironically good post and i agree with you
  people / weebs will get mad of you just because of your image but youre right its nothing more than larping on /a/
  what made you think you can be elitist in the first place
  i finally gave up  but where do you go to discuss anime now if anywhere every other community is still worse even worse right
  true there needs to be one imageboard for all the wise upstanding considerate posters who agree with me about literally everything and another containment imageboard for all the vulgar immoral and idiotic plebs who think i might be wrong about something
xd
  where do you go to discuss anime now  here 
i unironically go to /a/ just to post in/bump naruto threads fuck that shithole
  because /a/ stands for /a/utistic r/a/ge
  self proclaimed  you answered your old question  90 of /a/ comes from 2011 and up ironic weeb generation who thinks the worlds out of get them
  oh boy do i have the site for you  himasugiorg
  id add to this and say that the popularization of anime inspired games led to a generation of ironic weeb inspired by personalities like mad thad and other more relevant personalities i cant remember who spent most of his time doing anime shitposts on twitter and fb lots of people began doing the ironic weeb act and browsed 4chan thats when in 2012ish smug anime face came to be and /a/ and the rest of the site began hating each other as these guys went out their way to annoy everyone else /a/ included
  but at least the userbase has tried to maintain board quality   what you claim to be maintaining board quality is actually called rabid shitposting by everyone else and this discrepancy is the main reason we have these arguments    there was never a real way for the community to self moderate that its called reporting a post going your way to call the shitter a shitter only turns you into a shitter it became an excuse to arbitrarily declare threads bad and flood and spam shit sometimes even cp because it was justified
  /l/  why did jewoot deleted it
  blame /v/  ftfy
  writing a whole fucking essay  imagine being this assblasted over a word holy shit
  and our culture is lost forever  survival of the fittest nigger imageboard culture is meant to recycle    also implying internet communities havent been dead since 2012    lol this site is literally twitter non pc edition
  reddit spacing
  implying im going to go through the effort of zooming the inline post form because some autist gets triggered at boogeymen  loling  ur lyfe
  most of them are gone as far as i can see sure i am a complete newfag but from where i stand loads of things that fly today wouldve been called out a few years ago    things like filenames watermarks buzzwords memes social media netflix crunchyroll i mean its pretty much just a tip of an iceberg    i am also not trying to defend any of these practices merely stating that even for someone whos new the notion of /a/ having any high standards or ridculous amounts of conventions is clearly laughable
  back in 2014/2015 they were the clear majority but /a/ kept growing and people who just didnt give a fuck ended up outnumbering them like it happened to pretty much every group out there    the real problem is that with them browsing /a/ at any given time someone may do say or generate electrical impulses in a way that upsets one of these /a/ police wannabes and suddenly a completely normal an enjoyable thread goes to shit as this one dude decides he has to reply to every post telling them how wrong they are for liking things he doesnt like    they simply refuse to recognize their board has changed even after the mods themselves have stopped condoning them except kami but kami does it for the attention but we forgive him because hes legit a good mod and are still as active as ever
the thing that sticks out about /a/ users this thread most certainly included is their complete inability to ignore trolls and their complete reliance on mods to fix their mistakes  how can a blatant shitpost op be any more obvious than whats in op  i wish you guys kept your retardation outside of /qa/
  4chan has always been obsessed with convention   4chan has never had a golden age  4chan has always been great in the past and shit in the present  op has always been a faggot  lurk more
  i mean personally i like the idea of people having a set of convetions of how they should behave that extends to pretty much anything and if someone does not abide by them he gets shat on so he either leaves or adapts    the issue is when the conventions stop being shared and recognized by the majority so instead of the concesus rejecting outsiders it becomes just a one annoying prick that no one gives a shit about    i guess i somehow wish that things were different but considering that i kind of left the field it would be rather silly for me to comment on boards that i really wouldnt be contributing to that much
  mean personally i like the idea of people having a set of convetions of how they should behave that extends to pretty much anything and if someone does not abide by them he gets shat on  yeah problem is that only works on forums    and mods not only fucking hate forums but imageboards by design are impossible to have this behavior enforced remember that imageboards exist in a constant process of people pretending to be something and the newfags thinking they are right at home /a/ elitism is the end result of that a bunch of people deluded they are better than everyone else coming up with justifications without rhyme or reason    i somehow wish that things were different  ive always been a proponent of userstaff interaction as a means of building community but mods have always disagreed
  that only works on forums  i assume youre refering to need of users being recognizeable in some fashion usually by having a profile and that nonymousbased sites just cant make it work    i think that if thats the case there might be some grain fo truth in it though maybe not in a fashion you might agree with    i think that anonymous and profile based systems/communities often times arent that different from these sorts of angles depending upon the culture and its users they still have its ways of doing things and in actuality i would argue that its pretty reasoable to expect anonymous communities to try to ahere to their ways of behaving even more since its pretty much the only thing that could tie and make themselves recognizeable if you have profiles you can work on a basis of who youre actually interacting with when it comes to anonymous communities the only thing you know are the posts selves thus what is being posted is the only and ultimate thing that defines that community    its kind of hard to define and make point about but i think its how we people interact at least on some level    also in both systems do people feel like their way of thinking is the concesus its just how we people are its how we generally think and interact with everything the major difference is that in profile based communities you will have figures that can set the precedent of behaviour thats easy to recognize while there is no such thing in anonymous ones as its mostly a level playing field thus its easier to filter things we dont want to acknowledge thus its much easier to retain your mores even though they arent in concord with the majority    thus you end up with people who think they know the community in and out and how everyone thinks the same as them even though theyre complete outsiders that didnt actually get it but since theyre like the other newcomers they become the norm    its like tears in the rain
  posts can be be bad without being in violation of the rules obviously rulebreaking posts should be reported but what we witnessed is that simply ignoring poorqualitywithoutbeingrulebreaking posts allows them to flourish because they dont realise they arent doing anything wrong    therein lies the difficulty how to call out these posts to prevent behaviours which are undesirable for the board at large without derailing the thread into a flamewar about the issue or a shitfest because noone cares about the actual thread any more i unironically like pointing things out to be people and at least somewhat politely im serious    at this point im actually tempted to just start linking newfags to the wiki i bet a lot of /a/ posters dont even know theres a fucking wiki its outdated and i might go in and update some shit if i get the chance but its actually pretty useful it explains for example how to reverse image search where to torrent shows which media players to use how to add transparency to an image etc i should probably post at least some of the tutorial images i dont see many people post them any more and its better to spoonfeed the first step and let people work out the rest for themselves       trips confirm
  some of what you said reminds me of pic related     im very aware that 4chan will inevitably change although i do think we all get a little influence on exactly how it changes and i think those of who have been here longer know there are certain things we like that should remain constant whilst everything else around that changes im not talking about big things either i just want /a/ to be a place where people write in a decent standard of english and actually discuss anime rather than have the same shitty rec threads over and over or crap posts like sauce or people with fucking 240p screencaps of streaming sites and shit maybe i am the stop liking things i dont like autist  in fact i probably am because ive written far too much this post  is also me but i ran out of space i dont think i can help that though maybe its just my imagination but i swear there used to be more longposters like me on /a/ maybe not though
  i suppose my thoughts mightve been based off of that image since its something i recall seeing and thinking its applicable in a broader context    im not sure that stardards were ever too high on /a/ though i wouldnt expect them to ever increase since the board and the internet as a whole is populated by english second language phoneposters whose main time on the internet is spent on reposting memes on social media sites any expectations you might have should be shattered as these people dont really care and seeing what is popular makes me think that posting garbage is what many people do intentionally and they even find it absolutely amazing and amusing trying to change any of it is just spitting in the wind as these are the people that probably finace this site as theyre the ones seeing the most ads so there is no reason for site to be anyhow restricted for them    my take on /a/ is that i actually dont have much to do there as my main time i was really into the topic was like a year stint which was probably mainly fueled by novelty and eventually faded away though i still like to keep my eyes on the news the only reason i come back is to see few threads from older stuff i kinda get and fate threads as theyre still my favorite kind of threads to participate in though with the endless amount of spinoffs im kind of losing track
  i think youre probably right unfortunately as much as people claim there never was a golden age of 4chan and its always been shit which is mostly true that doesnt mean it isnt getting worse now i think phoneposters especially as well as other posters who try to bring over memes from twitter and other such places as well as even post screencaps of shitposts from there really have no idea how much theyre really shitting up everything i dont have any objection to memes or jokes by the way  its all part of the discussion and the board culture etc  i actually think all that stuff is great but we actually used to make stuff obviously this place doesnt exist to be a factory for oc but we used to make a lot more and have fun doing so now all the newfags turn up with bad memes from other places and spam them rather than making something new or holding any actual conversation    obviously this is a criticism that extends further than /a/ i think theyre probably the first group of newfags that cannot really be brought into the fold in the same way that users of other sites in the past could be because you could tell them to lurk more and basically bully them until they eventually became decent posters the reason is theyre not using this place as their main website its just another place they go to shitpost    posting garbage is what many people do intentionally and they even find it absolutely amazing and amusing  this is true though i do this because it is amazing but at least i go to s4s or whatever other shitposty place again why post fucking garbage memes in the middle of a discussion its like professor oak says theres a time and a place for everything    also yeah i totally lost track of all the fate stuff because theres far too much of it i kind of just stopped after carnival phantasm but i do still miss the old threads posting about tohsakas defenseless anus or whatever good times
  i got a smartphone myself recently as well but i never even considered using 4chan on it at all i mean there are other websites i can go to on my phone and its quite convenient but i just dont understand that inclination at all
  its literally the new umad dont think about it too hard
  im very aware that 4chan will inevitably change  everything is in a perpetual evolution not accept that fact is the same that not accept that earth is spinning earth gonna keep spin with or without us thats all
  i assume youre refering to need of users being recognizable in some fashion  i mean enforcing a truly static behaviour forums still change culturally but an order of magnitude slower that imageboards something awful which was one of the worlds largest forum was the same shitty place from 2004 to 2014 and they still had some years left before any mayor cultural change what forums have that imageboards have not is the ability to permanently banish a member of their community ban evading is simply not a problem in forums this makes the userbase much more docile and private in their opinions and when shit hits the fan it also makes them much likely to leave out of frustration  its why ibs absorbed most forum populations out there    by being able to ban evade constantly imageboards users simply do not care about the established site culture as a matter of fact id say this is the only real distinction about imageboards and that ephemerality is a meaningless meme coined by fucking shii permanent archives wouldnt have changed 4chans behaviour at all    also in both systems do people feel like their way of thinking is the concesus  i disagree go make a hot take in a forum see how many people send you pms with their opinions and how many engage you directly and how many mods boot in see how they shrink out when you the former to express their opinions on the forum punishment in forums  both social and physical  have long lasting effects something alien to us you can be effectively shamed out of the community    thus you end up with people who think they know the community in and out and how everyone thinks the same as them even though theyre complete outsiders that didnt actually get it but since theyre like the other newcomers they become the norm  this is true and id like to add that historically the newcomers always outnumbered the previous generation its one of the reasons why 4chan constantly forgets itself
  posts can be be bad without being in violation of the rules  that doesnt give one an excuse to break the rules and start fights
  i unironically like pointing things out to be people and at least somewhat politely im serious  i understand to point but i see things from a larger picture you can expect so much social responsibility for random users by virtue of being effectively impossible i see calling out as useless    furthermore if done politely and in good faith those responses almost always end up in good discussion which wouldnt really count as what we are defining as selfmoderation as this is something all the non retarded parts of the site does when someone is dropping the ball others will point it out    where to torrent shows which media players to use how to add transparency to an image  id support this but that would get you in problems when people accuse you of spoonfeeding      yeah that pic is unironically one of the best description of ibs out there i wonder if theres a name for that behaviour    although i do think we all get a little influence on exactly how it changes  honestly i think modern 4chan is pretty much non pc twitter which more or less agrees with what you just said twitter has engulfed the entire damn internet      s populated by english second language phoneposters  phoneposter yes but second language i think 80 of non english natives only browse /int/
  the reason is theyre not using this place as their main website its just another place they go to shitpost  more or less i think ive talked this out with some oldfags on /wsg/ internet communities dont really exist anymore all the mayor websites have become platforms where you go and act a certain behaviour 4chan included
  why is politely calling someone out not selfmoderation but doing it impolitely is im not sure what you meant by this    with the whole spoonfeeding thing i know people would be mad at me about that but there are guides on the wiki people actually used to post on /a/ years and years ago and i remember it im against spoonfeeding as well in general but in this case it would actually be those posters who are unaligned with how the board is/was     i hate to say this because i dont like them having them but perhaps the best of both worlds on this issue would be to have a sticky it would be at the top of the board like the /fit/ one that linked to the wiki and that was it and then you could really be justified telling people theyre new as fuck and not to even try denying it
  the death of online communities is a real tragedy and the modern internet user now approaches every website as if it were just another social media network a platform where you act out a certain behaviour  i think this is a great description of what a website actually functions as for newer internet users today but alas the wild west days of the web have ended and corporations have now come to dominate the internet as well not just in terms of website ownership but also in terms of commodifying everything online into something to become consumed rather than something to participate in
bump
  why is politely calling someone out not selfmoderation but doing it impolitely is   because of intent i guess self moderation has been for years used as an excuse to flame other people    if you read both our posts all you need to add is that freud gets me pic to the argument of oldfags acting a persona and newfags thinking they are right at home to understand where im going    the originals guys who came up with the concept of self moderation havent been around since early 2010s everyone else has been using it as an excuse to be a shitter    but perhaps the best of both worlds on this issue would be to have a sticky  i agree but experience also tells me that people really fucking hate reading guides and would rather just ask theres always gonna be a number of numbskulls who just ask      yeah and the more i think about this the more i come to the conclusions that some people where subconsciously aware of this lulzsec was practically the last dregs of raid culture deciding to go out in a bang
  literally me
  why is a selfproclaimed board of oldfags so fucking easy to work into a seethe  theyre sensitive teens
  oldfags acting a persona and newfags thinking they are right at home  ah the old a community that gets its laughs pretending to be retarded will attract retards who think they are in good company been on /a/ since it began this is the one single mentality that has been most damaging not just to /a/ but 4chan as a whole you can replace retards with anything you like fauxelitists pedophiles racists scriptkiddies etc its nobodys fault just hard to see a meteoric rise in popularity coming nobody considered the possibility that 4chan would get as big as it did and so nobody decided to wind down their behaviour
bump
  this post makes a good point but pretending to be fauxelitists so it attracted actual fauxelitists doesnt seem right to me its not like the elitism on /a/ started out as a joke and then newfags started to act like elitists to fit in not realising that was the case granted there are certainly many posters on /a/ who act like smug elitists despite the fact they are not actually that knowledgeable or havent been here that long but thats not how it all started     the elitism on /a/ actually did start from oldfags doing it seriously i think the post that explains it all best is probably this one       ok that makes sense id still classify that stuff probably even the flaming as selfmoderation id just say its selfmoderation done very poorly but i get your point and i think we agree actually
ill try to put this in words outsiders newfags and edgy sciolist clueless folks of all stripes understand whether theyre fresh from leddit or are some brainwashed misled mods    imagine niggers imagine the immigration crisis in the eu you can see where im going imagine the eu 100 years from now that is what 4chan is today complete with these replacements becoming controllers ie mods we already have that imagine if to us /a/ crystalclear remembers mods used to be a touch respectable and gave a shit at least on /a/ but then turned into fucking niggers they moderate like fucking niggers they defend to the death the ideals of being lazy being incompetent permanently understaffed citing that just because most of the site is moderated like shit that its somehow unfair that /a/ actually have standards and desires for its board to not turn out like /tv/ or /b/ that shows that /a/ actually values its own existence and cares for itself how in the fuck did that ever get turned on its head as a bad thing it fucking isnt /a/ wants outsiders to wipe the shit off their shoes before entering and not pretend like they know the place that is all recognize your fucking nigger tier behavior    to attack /a/s so called elitism is to misunderstand it these are actually not that high of demands at all similar to if /v/ expected people to have played more games than candy crush and angry birds before opining about the state of the industry     to defend not needing to really deeply know something is to defend the notion its fine to fuck over the people who do a pure selfish ignorant bratty tantrum borne of various things newfags may not like an environment expecting them to actually fucking know their shit and be ready to get called out if they dont is that really a dangerous concept hardly its actually the fucking norm another influence is the we wuz kangz because /b/ was 4chan argument which defeats itself looking at modern /b/
  i think theyre probably the first group of newfags that cannot really be brought into the fold in the same way that users of other sites in the past could be because you could tell them to lurk more and basically bully them until they eventually became decent posters the reason is theyre not using this place as their main website its just another place they go to shitpost  this is the big problem 4chan is suffering from these days faggots that come here solely to act like faggots in order to make people mad enough to call them faggots are flocking here in droves they want the kind of reactions that were previously useful for shaming people into lurking more and learning how to not be faggots thats what theyre here for
  only works on forums  it worked here for a decade  too many newfags and lazy moderation and phoneposting killed that    theres almlst nothing to do now anymore because its far too late  at this point i just upset them out of spite
  imagine niggers    oh boy here we go
  i wish /a/utists get taken down a peg their oldfag larping really gets annoying     i really fucking hate /pol/ and /pol/tards but im also im thankful for them because they attract new users to this site changing forever the landscape and userbase of this place and i know that this makes those oldfags seethe
  it worked here for a decade  lol nope
  i too enjoy satire good post
  i guess you dont realize you quoted my post and told me i didnt understand /a/ using another one of my posts as a reference
  oh shit i didnt realise that i think maybe i was just confused by what your point was    what i was basically trying to say was that fauxelitism doesnt fit in with that sentence in the same way the other words clearly do because it wasnt a joke initially i dont even know the difference between elitism and fauxelitism in this context and the original elitism on /a/ wasnt a joke which was later taken seriously so i guess i just didnt get what you were trying to say    i think elitism on /a/ began circa 2008 mainly for two different reasons firstly as your initial post mentioned the whole /b/tard sekrit club mentality shit was really pretty big around that time i dont hold that attitude and never did although its not like i went around posting about /b/ on other parts of internet because that shit is generally pretty cringy i think as the userbase of the site swelled during 2007/8 the boards truly became differentiated from each other culturally as well as topicwise as opposed to the previous sitewide culture which had slowly but finally eroded a such its easy to understand why older /a/ posters would be annoyed by sekrit club /b/tards posting on /a/ around this time because these two groups of posters had already become distinct i think this explains why many oldf/a/gs were alienated and left and im sure many of those went to /jp/ as well this is why i linked your original post because i thought it was accurate about how things went down but i didnt agree with all of it and i think its important not to conflate the sekrit club shit with other reason elitism on /a/ began newfags
    continued    another consequence of the growth in the site was the massive influx of newfags at this time and the emergence of elitism on /a/ did genuinely materialise from within the board as a effort to counterbalance the incompetent newfags this occurred simultaneously with the whole /b/ thing i know this wasnt mentioned in your initial post and i think we probably disagree about precisely why older /a/ posters left as well as the extent to which this elitism was necessary for reference i think it was inevitable these attitudes would develop approximately when they did one way or the other and that they were at least somewhat necessary to maintain the parts of boards culture which made it worthwhile in the first place this is my initial post here and i think i could have worded it better but i still essentially feel the same way 
  good post anon 4chan is still like a second home to me and its honestly the only place on the internet i really use
there are way better imageboards than 4chan for discussing anime people only come here for cheap entertainment now
  the original elitism on /a/ was never truly native to /a/ of course on an anonymous imageboard anything and everything is transient and board culture is only relevant in the present moment but there was a distinct disconnect between how /a/ used to be from 20032005 and how it changed from around 2006 onwards the move towards fauxelitism was an imported ideology from people who had come across the site through /b/s notoriety and assumed the rest of the board held the secret club mentality they thought /b/ had    im sure there were some pre2006 /a/ users predisposed to elitism who welcomed the shift but there was certainly a quick change in values that had fully solidified in around 2008ish much like the other boards that fell victim to the same process    i call it fauxelitism because those people had nothing to be elitist about they were not any more knowledgeable experienced or otakulike than any other anime community they just chose to shun weaboo culture at the time because they the new /b/tards didnt like the idea that they might not be taken seriously if they dont act like elitists they did this to almost every board they thought was big enough to take interest in hence why some niche communities like /c/ /po/ /toy/ /3/ /tg/ etc remained untouched by this ideology for a long time and are or were generally much more laid back    in my eyes the true dividing line between new and old 4chan was in 2008 but started in 2006 and can be blamed almost exclusively on /b/s reputation beyond the site itself the culture shifted too radically as a result of the newfound notoriety and was never the same again /jp/ is far more like old /a/ used to be in terms of attitude and values many of us jumped ship when the split came in 2008 because /a/ was unrecognizable at that point
        you have to remember as well the whole phobia of newfags is a /b/tard imported mentality that was never natural on 4chan people would joke about new posters who didnt understand certain memes or how to post but the whole lurk moar newfag mentality was only taken seriously by the new /b/tards who couldnt tell irony from reality before the imported /b/tard culture swept in everyone understood that anonymous meant anonymous calling someone new didnt really mean anything because you could be talking to anyone    fear of newfags is not a part of original 4chan culture because there wasnt really a culture to preserve people who went around blaming newfags and telling people to lurk moar were people who thought that there was a defined set of unspoken rules or a certain way to behave when there wasnt     this is the one sticking point so many people cannot seem to understand about old 4chan when they ask about it they dont realize that the principle of anonymity was central to the experience there was no youre a /b/tard or were /a/ users you just posted and nobody made preconceived notions about who you might be the idea that were from /b/ so we post in this way and have these beliefs or dont let those people into /a/ because theyre not like us didnt exist there was no us or them you just posted threads or you posted in threads back then /b/ was the general dumping ground for the whole site it didnt really have an identity     the whole 4chan image we have now of cp hackers dark comedy extreme content raids etc is completely fictitious  it never really existed people gave it that image because they knew some of those things were posted they just didnt realize it was a joke

  whats that supposed to mean
  well i dont have any friends irl and it makes me very sad the only people i talk to is on here ive thought about making a discord does /qa/ do that
no
does my friend from middle school who lives in my town that i havent seen in years because neither of us ever goes out count as irl we only talk online
used to like 8 years ago
  yeah that counts      i dont use steam i download and crack all of my games because im cheap      yeah its been about that long for me as well
  not really a few people i talk to but not that many people i really want to spend time with
not really but im autistic
  yeah im on the spectrum as well
i have people i talk to and that would probably say that im their friend but i dont know if i really consider them my friends i can only talk to them about things like work or weather or other really shallow topics and only ever talk to them or hang out with them if i am in a setting where i have to theyre boring as fuck and only ever want to drink and chase women or go eat fast food    besides all of that in general theyre just kind of shitty people only friends i have are here on /qa/
  nope
got a bunch of random girls ive fucked phone numbers on muh phone    maybe i should contact them to see if they want just hang out hold the fucking
i want a friend that i can hug sometimes and while in bed maybe friends sleep together right and tightly embrace one another
  discord replaced inperson friendship in my life voice chat is the superior method of interpersonal activity as long as anime/video games are your hobbies    
  disgusting
  dont mind him hes just roleplaying
up
  i hope you find such a person it would be nice      more or less the same i dont think it has much to do with the neet or otaku life as i experienced this drift when i was working/studying too peoples interests paths and goals just dont align drift apart and to some degree thats a good thing      ive thought about making a discord does /qa/ do that  i would join
  yours
not really anymore
i used to but not really since i quit drugs they bore me now
yes  sometimes they pat my head which is nice
top
    fuck discord
no
i havent had an irl friend in a decade
up
i definitely have people id consider acquaintances but not real friends that i hang out with outside of work/school when i was younger i had to move away from a lot my closeknit friends and it really killed me so i never made any real friends thereafter that combined with the general culture shock of moving across the country  from north to south  made things pretty hard too
  i have one friend but she has severe depression and a shitty home life and does nothing to try to fix it so i end up feeling more like her counselor its very stressful
i used to have friends but stopped talking to them after school  now i dont know how to make friends anymore
only if cousins who i see about twice a year but still get along really well with count
no  i dont have any online either
  i know how you feel i like helping people but sometimes they dont want to open up and sometimes its too much and you want someone to listen to you but noone cares to
im content not having regular friends though i would like a girlfriend
  yeah
i have five good friends i care for deeply and a bunch of people who i can talk to from time to time im not sure how i did it since im shy as shit and my psychiatrist says that i am autism maybe im just lucky
delete this thread please i feel bad about losing them
  no i havent had any for 4 years
2  one who went to live somewhere else and we talk online and other one who lives close by we see each other thrice a month or so to drink whiskey and watch anime and old simpsons chapters
hey /v/ here just wondering why you guys consider dreamcast to be retro but ps2 isnt despite the fact that there was only 7 months between their respective releases
  because op is a faggot
if it was up to me it wouldnt be dreamcast is miserable
  but ps2 isnt despite the fact that there was only 7 months between their respective releases  no they were over a year apart
allowing the dreamcast was a mistake
  gotta coddle the poor sega fags with their innovative and ahead of its time shit console
probably allowed because it died before n64 support was pulled
but steel is heavier than feathers
  i love how much newfags cry and how easily they expose themselves
  dreamcast release 9/9/99  ps2 release 4th march 2000
  what are international releases  there were dreamcast games being made the same year as banjokazooie my guy   you know because it came out nov 271998 in japan
  ps2 will be retro once ps5 comes out i want to die i am so old
 op  because whoever gatekeeps the definition of retro here is a fag and we really should be able to discuss ps2/gcn/xbox the ps2 is older now than the n64 was when this board first began so id say that qualifies it as retro /vr/ started in 2013 at the time the n64 was 17 years old now in 2018 the ps2 is 18 years old how the fuck is it not retro
  because it died if it continued to thrive like the playstation and xbox it probably wouldnt have been allowed
  it certainly isnt modern i think that ps2 era needs its own thing separate from modern but different from retro smb and haloce dont belong in the same conversation but neither do battlefield v and armored core 2
  neo/vr/ when
  quit caffeine and start exercising it will make you feel young again
so legitimately there needs to be an addressing of whats considered retro for /vr/ as the 6th gen should be old enough for the prerequisites
  there is practically a /vr/ general on /qa/ asking for this we all agree with you here my man all i can say is if enough people from /vr/ send feedback about it to the feedback page then maybe just maybe something will happen
  wait what 17 years is considered retro dead space is 10 years old so could it be retro in a couple of years
  because the dreamcast came out in the 90s and the 90s was the last year of the 20th century nothing in the 21st century will be considered retro until the year 2100
    but gameplay has hardly changed since 6th gen
the last ps2 game came out in 2013  the last dreamcast game came out in 2007 and there were only a handful of games out after 2004
anyone else ever revisit their thread and agree with a post until you realise it was one of your old ones    every  damn  time

  you may have alzheimers

so where are you going now that youve lost all control you do have an alternative dont you many spinoffs are in dire need of your attention they may be unimaginative and derivative trash but they are now the closest thing to an uninhibited canvas that you are going to see now that the restrictions are in place explore your options and then pack your bags its only going to get a lot harder from here on in
good morning schiz
i was considering one of these frog friends for a christmas present
  a tough proposition on one hand youre giving matt furie the arch traitor of kek your shekels but he cute
who grouped all the frog threads together in the catalog someone is being cheeky today
  who grouped all the anime threads together in the catalog someone is being cheeky today
ohh i see i didnt realize larger forces were at work here far be it from me to question the motives of the weeb mafia
dont forget to eat lots of things to become big soft and cute
  sooooooooooo fucking duuuuuuumb
3d fat isnt cute
i refuse to be fat  i need to become a thin and smol and cute birl
  i believe in you
disturbing thread
pig out /qa/ treat yourself to something nice   just keep eating and keep eating let that dopamine release hit you constantly  soon youll pass out into a comfy sleep and you can wake up and do it all again   just dont worry let yourself go and focus completely on self pleasure and gratification keep yourself full happy and satisfied   after a few months youll get a bit of a belly its big deal its just a flabby little manifestation of how good youve been treating yourself and what a nice time youve been having   and if youre a girl thiccness and even more than just thiccness is fashionable right now so you got nothing to worry about
  op heres what you should do keep the neet lifestyle but go the store and get a vast amount of the most unhealthy but delicious junk food you can find do this every week and drop any hobby/activity you might have devote yourself entirely to chasing physical pleasure after a few weeks of this get into drugs if you arent already of course as i said you should be filming your progress keep up your horrible diet and also start doing light drugs start smoking and drinking too dont be afraid to become a hopeless alcoholic after a few months youll probably feel different like a different person the amount of bodily harm youve caused yourself combined with the mental stagnation and becoming extremely accustomed to instant gratification will cause your mind to shy away from thoughts of ever going back at this point this is where you start getting into harder drugs cocaine meth etc dont do them so much that it becomes uncomfortable for you exactly but also do not moderate yourself in the slightest you will start using them more and more with time get into even harder drugs like heroin and opium eventually too keep this lifestyle up for maybe a couple years and if you havent died already then one day just overdose on purpose on cam of course  the entire process from when you first start with getting fat to the very end when youre an inhuman broken drug addict 99 close to death should take around 5 years video logs should be bimonthly and they should show you partaking in your decadent activities not only talking about them and so they should last at least 2 hours each    the end product would be absolutely fascinating
chubby gf with big but and tid
  now its a disturbing thread    i agree that it would be incredibly fascinating but op is most likely to not do this  where could we find someone who would theres gotta be a forum for this stuff
  why not just livestream your entire decadent life
there is no weeb mafia  is this actually true /qa/
ohhhhh
  yes there is a weeb mafia their existence has been copiously documented         
so was the true weeb mafia the friends we made all along 
  no life is not like the moral of television episode
there is but it was not formed early as you might think it happened some time in early 2018 with the qa irc and was later cemented by the steam chat i no longer have a horse in this race thanks to them    prior to that though it was truly a ragtag group your ramblings as to the weeb mafia was always a selffulfilling prophecy
  they started coming here in late 2016 regularly and by february of 2017 they were here in full force they nobly rallied the rest of 4chan and bravely defended /qa/ against the rampaging hordes of /mlpol/ in the great april fools wars of 2017 the problem was that the abused the report feature so much that the mods froze the board for a month now the problem is that they are still here after almost 2 years feel like they are the true /qa/ posters and wont go back to the /jp/ spinoffs they came from     tldr they got here in february 2017 and wont leave
  this this is correct
  999998
/pol/ppet frog thread  filtered
  it is in fact more of a small loosely connected group of posters in varying states of derangement occasionally orbited by some ironic weebs who you can find either freshly banned from /a/ or anywhere from the open internet really and equally few typically somewhat younger posters who shower the former in ridicule
  the tripcodes they used are permabanned
  ask them they are on right now
bumping for relevancy
  the weeb mafia bump bot has made /qa/ fast enough to send this to page 9 in about an hour
  luckily youre dying and cant sleep for more than 40 minutes without getting up and checking /qa/ if you were a functioning human and slept a crisp 68 hours of good sleep all the threads you talk to yourself would be gone when you wake up then again if you were a functioning human you wouldnt be on /qa/ talking to yourself in a mania about weeb mafia
  if there was really no weeb mafia  why would have hidden their favorite sluts name in your image
    found the weeb mafioso
  see  
    stupid frogposters
  who exactly are you trying to convince at this point anyway schizo the mods come to /qa/ to track users they ban for the fun of it do you think repeating the same shit to them will change anything theyre more aware of the situation than you are schizo the mods even started banning you for saying weeb mafia but then gave up because they probably thought it was more funny to let you be in a mania posting on /qa/ 24/7
  tell us more about the schizo
  its always that one guy
the real question is how the weeb mafia will keep /qa/ now that theres nonstop refugees being moved here by the mods
  mods move threads to /qa/ constantly and theres more people floating around on average  youre still the only dumb frgger subhuman schizo bumping his threads  ohhhhhhhh how can /qa/ ever recover from this more people than ever but youre still as isolated and lonely as before you frgoid pavement frgger meme is practically already dead just waiting for the mods to start banning it everywhere on 4channel
  before they would temporarily leave /qa/ and come back later full force but with meta being moved here pretty much 24/7 they have nowhere to run i believe sooner or later theyll go all in and try to wipe the board with outright spam mods have been on high alert lately and such act will force them to take measures as an example when was the last time you saw a stream thread exactly
  wow that guy is mad
  try to wipe the board with outright spam  they cant do this as easily as they used to be able to with the new posting rules they have to be more subtle and make threads more slowly
  im not even a pepe poster
  they  you really dont need coordination when its an activity performed by a single person of their own volition
  i agree but they have their own spinoffs an irc channel and discord server set up and then there is the constant recruitment drive for their steam group in short they are always chatting scheming and blogging with each other in a giant offsite circlejerk
  oh like himasugi  they helped reiko raid r9k
  its actually the same people
  frog spammer came here in february of 2017 and declared war on weebs
  who do you think is going to believe this
  thats the true though thats when multiple threads of pepe started to be made to bump off the weeb threads
  whos they  i came here around 2016 and met prose alice and pakarifag and we all ended up disbanding  prose is gone alice is on /bant/ and pakarifag is just gone gone
  no       they is the weeb mafia the group of people who like it when pic related happens
  stop larping people dont actively spam /qa/ like that and the people who reported on it like pikarifag are gone and 4chan wont allow him back on the irc to stop the fucking raiders
  who the hell are those nobodies
  fuck off 2017 faggot you wont take my /qa/ freedom and you should fuck off back home redditor
  who in the fuck is larping yes they spam the board literally every day they are doing it right now as i type this pikarifag is gone but /qajp/ and yaya and grxvdf are all still here there is a systematic organized attempt to take over this board and it started with  and the pretentious council of 12 posts on /meta/ after the board went down in april     you are right that the person is gone who wrote the /really/ good spam scripts that can do this      that person is gone and all that are left are skiddies but the ones that are left are worse when they try to turn /qa/ into a /jp/ spinoff a team effort
  cringe
  pikarifag is gone  and he was a good friend too dont blame him for trying to go into the irc and demand that mods actually do something about the fucking board  /qajp/ arent true /qa/ im the only poster that can claim that    see pic
  /qajp/ arent true /qa/  well jesus tapdancing christ we can agree on something im astounded the problem is that /he/ thinks he is true /qa/ and wont leave us alone i genuinely have pity for the poor creature it has to be mental illness that drives a person to keep trying to convert a board perpetually filled with angry 4chan crossboarders into something it will never be
  well yeah we came here to shit up this place ironically to make fun of it most of us otherwise had long since washed our hands of 4chan  anyways he didnt actually stop posting that long ago because even i remember him
  but he isnt he didnt come here during the time when the board was raided for days at a time by fucking crossboarders hes fucking scum i have more right to claim whats kosher than him because of what i did to help foster the community here  i still wish the vn project would of worked i want to try again but the teenbros would just ruin it i miss prose still    i havent seen him in years
  then maybe ive been here longer than i thought and you thought
  what did you mean by this
  muh community  a group of 5 weeb supremacists raiding the meta board for 2 years is not and will never be a community and the crossboarders are the point not a raid
  dipshit this wasnt a metaboard until 2018  also its not about the weebs its about 4chan first and anything that wasnt 4chan see reddit any offsite raid group any group that /jp/ spinoffs like to go arent 4chan first
  where do you people get this revisionist bullshit from
  lol
  he thinks thats /qa/  delusional
   is not /qa/ either but he/she/they cant stop roleplaying
board is being spammed with porn and dick pics ironically its probably not the weeb mafia doing it this time
  dipshit this wasnt a metaboard until 2018  can you stop spreading bullshit this board replaced /q/ as the metaboard back in 2015 during moots final qa and always has been and always had meta threads
that /qa/ dream   rright
  if only those mods realized who they were talking to there
  totallynotthrustvect  what happened also werent all mods barring dave ops now whats with the halfop
  ill peel off your skin with my nails
  why do people keep thinking im relevant to anything going on    leave me and my hot opinions in peace
it seems like the mafia is in decline
  sure all you have to do is leave for your spinoffs  anytime now
  you can look forward to this being posted as evidence for various causes for at least the next year or two    happens to the best of them
they are fighting each other  time to strike bros
  im not from that crew    man i cant belileve i didnt save the old /qa/ manifesto
the mafia is so strong that even 4chan manager once joined /qa/ irc channel to talk with them
  do you mean the old declaration from like 2015 or is there something older than that
  hes talking about the revisionist infographic that talks about how /jp/ saved everything on /qa/ i have it saved but it isnt worth posting
  yeah that one    back when people were dumping old 4chan folders and shit
i miss my old 4chan folder  i miss all my fgsfds macros
  had to rummage through the unsorted to find it assuming this is the one  also please no skin peeling
  im glad you didnt post the revisionist one
double checked my oldest stuff right now is from 08 but theres a huge break from around when captcha was added to when /jp/ started to get really fucking dumb
  oh wow this is great
  saved
  no this was the board no one used until 2018  how fucking retarded are you
  not him but hes not wrong /qa/ always had people here the only time no one used the board was when it was frozen for a month
  he is wrong /qa/ is/was a place where mods forgot and stopped carrying  to call this place meta implies that the mods actively go here and hang out and answer questions when in fact they do nothing
  maybe you can convince some newfag of that but for those of us who were there your story is comically wrong also mods obviously do come here or the loli spam wouldnt keep getting deleted every day like it does
  do mods actively go on this board and answer questions yes or no   please answer this one
  this isnt /q/ its a meta board
  this isnt a meta board to begin with its the place where moot and hiro hold /questions and answers/
  it literally says its a meta board in the sticky which hiro put up himself are you that dense
  who said anything about answering questions that was never the point of /qa/ you shouldnt confuse it with old /q/ like that    the real question should be if mods dont come here who is doing all of this deleting  
  in 2018 you fucking retard i am claiming that this board wasnt a meta board until 2018 when hiro allowed redditors to talk about neogaf  fucking dipshit    that was never the point of /qa/  then where did moot host the question and answer then
  then where did moot host the question and answer then  i meant after that when he left the board up specifically so 4chan users could answer each others questions i guess youre too new to remember that
  when he left the board up specifically so 4chan users could answer each others questions   so its a board where people can bitch about 4chan problems but isnt a meta thread
  stop this
  its the customer support and complaint board silly do you need a daily reminder
  customer support  no because again the fucking mods dont answer  complaint board is more reasonable
  again who said anything about mods customers answer each others questions here apparently everyone except you is fine with that
  why the fuck would the customers help another customer
  why wouldnt they humans are helpful creatures
  fuck them
  fuck you
  go back on reddit
no because again the fucking mods dont answer    go back to rddit fag  youre obviously bored out from all the inane discussion there
  one example out of countless 1000s of threads on /qa/
    t buttmad mafiosos
/qa/ civil war  day x nov 2018    frogposters 12 dead 7 injured  /jp/sies 20 dead 12 injured  schizospammers 4 dead 1 injured  anime 11 dead 3 injured  hirospam 1 dead 2 injured  others 64 dead 89 injured
  faggots 1 op 1 you
a redditobsessed man with the mind of a small child
im his inner voice living rent free
lol gaiafags
        you fucking idiot something being a meta board doesnt mean it needs to have mods who actively come and answer questions it just means that people use it for discussing 4chan itself ie  meta discussions    if no one used it as a meta board then please oh please explain all these thousands of meta threads from 20152017      wow so many meta threads on a nonmeta board
  thats not meta discussion thats just bitching and moaning
  here from desktop thread on /g/
you can both join my autism mafia guys      take your pilss gramps      cant you get a better wm
  but in reality would 42 midgets win against a lion
the weebs are so dumb that they even get swindled into bumping a frog thread  what a bunch of fools
    
  its a frogthread that isnt a dumb frog thread
admitting frog threads are better  the weebs sure are dimwitted
2466835  reddit has no sense of context
  how is it now if were discussing meta aspects of 4chan whining or not doesnt matter toward whether its meta
  talking about the state of affairs doesnt make it meta
  yes actually it does by definition make it meta discussing the state of affairs of 4chan is one of the main reasons this board is here mods dont want that content on any other board but this one
      whining is meta it does refer to the state of the site but it is also shitposting
  fair enough id argue that it isnt always shitposting but i agree on principle
shitposting is just a synonym for post i dont like
  only positive opinions allowed
  no that makes no sense is it meta to talk about the state of affairs in the united states if you live in the united states
  yes that is meta unless you are talking about specific affairs of state     each board on 4chan has a topic talking about the board instead of the board topic is meta
  thats not how this works talking about the board itsnt meta talking about 4chan on 4chan isnt meta its just regular discussion
      the faq defines shitposting as  knowingly contributing low quality offtopic or ill intentioned posts  i dont entirely agree with it but its useful for this case whining which i take to mean a very simple post composed of i dont like this thing do something about it fits the bill of a low quality post one is knowingly making  why is it low quality because the poster is not willing to explain his point of view experiences and understanding of the site that lead him to his conclusions that would take time effort and would be easier to tackle such posts normally cause a chain of shitflinging where users misunderstand each other or rather misquote because it gives trolls an easier time and hardly ever end with anyone taking something away from it it is not shitposting because it criticizes the staff it may very well speak in its favor for increasing moderation or do the opposite or because i personally dont like it its shitposting because the user is consciously making the choice to take the low road fostering the usage of memetic retorts taking away credibility from anyone who may hold the same ideas due to association and overall is just cancer
  whatever dude you appear to be the only person who doesnt understand how meta works on 4chan thread that talk about boards and threads that talk about 4chan in general get moved to /qa/ by mods because they are meta threads
test
  no i know what meta is this isnt the fucking meta board you nimrod
  i dont know how you can rationalize that to yourself when mods keep moving meta threads here
  given that the kind users itt dont care about having a conversation and are the cancer they whine about im gonna give some examples before going to bed i hate it when arguments dont plant themselves in a concrete base and instead operate on a nebulous consensus  since i did not explain what shitposting is in  i got ironic oneliner replies in the form of  and  this happened because of prior assumptions and customs its very normal for people in the web and irl to simplify thought systems when discussing something into a couple of poorly thought out postulates when two people find these postulates to be incompatible the normal occurrence is for both to consider the other irrational how could a sane person possibly reach such a retarded conclusion at that point the only thing that comes to their heads is to insist on their lines with the hope that the opponent will magically recapacitate discussion dies  take a look at  while his report is interesting and valuable it very clearly comes accompanied by assumptions on quality board culture the role of moderation and the split  saw these things planted himself as an opposite and mocked op dead on arrival had /qa/ been actually populated by /lit/erari the thread would have devolved into shittery either way  and if you pay attention to these two peeps   youll notice a problem while one of the two defined meta as discussing the state of affairs of 4chan the other denied that definition but put up none of his own it shifted from defining meta to vague implications and metaphores that ended up making both leave    take your time gentlemen
  to think that retards like this browse the board on a daily basis is worrying
  shitposting is subjective and relative metaposting is not
  youre wrong
  meta does not exist that is the point why make a definition for something that doesnt exist are you fucking stupid or something
  wtf are you talking about
  because the poster is not willing to explain his point of view experiences and understanding of the site that lead him to his conclusions that would take time effort and would be easier to tackle   anyone who writes a fucking essay to explain why a thing is shit is just going to get tldrd    its more convenient for everyone involved to provide explanations when asked or as a conversation organically develops
  i claim that meta isnt real you say it isnt  i state that meta doesnt mean shit its offtopic to begin with and this board is a board for being offtopic hence it cant be meta because meta implies it is offtopic  if the board is ontopic for whinning about 4chan then how can it truly be meta  is it meta for the senate in the united states to talk about policy and the going ons in the world
  whining about 4chan is meta nobody but you seems to question this the other poster agreed that its meta but also says its shitposting
  ones opinion on shitposting is subjective the act itself of knowingly contributing low quality or ill intentioned posts isnt i disagree with the offtopic part that one i do believe to be more subjective the most appropiate definition of quality i can find is from oxford the standard of something as measured against other things of a similar kind the degree of excellence of something we can then call a post low quality by comparing it with a different post that would be more conductive to discussion one that doesnt antagonize others and properly explains itself there are also ontopic posts with average or high quality which i do not like but i dont call them shitposts  please elaborate on metaposting is not because i dont get it    garbage logic does astronomy not exist because its unrelated to economic studies i tried to define meta discussion a shot in  its offtopic because it doesnt talk about the boards topic its about the relations of its users  in fact i just checked wikipedia it does have an article titled metadiscussion and starts with the following  the term metadiscussion means a discussion whose subject is a discussion metadiscussion explores such issues as the style of a discussion its participants the setting in which the discussion occurs and the relationship of the discussion to other discussions on the same or different topics  /qa/ is where true meta threads are allowed thats why im here    it would be more convenient if jumping to conclusions so violently wasnt so common i believe it would be better for anyone interested in a conversation to make these things clear otherwise it might cause one hundred posts of nothing but crap   was a very nice thread about realtime vs turnbased in a certain type of rpg and it had some excellent argumenting youre gonna have to trust me on this one fireden is currently down
    when two people find these postulates to be incompatible the normal occurrence is for both to consider the other irrational how could a sane person possibly reach such a retarded conclusion at that point the only thing that comes to their heads is to insist on their lines with the hope that the opponent will magically recapacitate discussion dies  you didnt take your time lads  id understand if you told me ive got every single thing wrong its happened before but you could put the slightest effort into it and wed all be better off
  thats a good definition of meta but when meta appears on 4chan it takes the form of talking about boards and sites instead of the topic of the board at hand my point in saying metaposting is not was that there is a much stronger set of criteria for discussing if a post is meta compared to the arbitrary line to cross for whether a post is shitposting which is subject to a persons opinion this is further compounded by shitposting     as an example to compare and contrast a discussion on the differences between 4chan and 8gag is both on topic and meta for /qa/ but a discussion on the benefits of going to 8gag is not on topic and not relevant to 4chan meta enough to be here when weebspammers discuss /ota/ or the rest of the mafia spinoffs its meta but not on topic when other 4chan users tell them to go back to /ota/ or /nen/ or /what/ that is more meta and on topic for /qa/ than just blatantly discussing other sites but still shitposting a third option is a thread about the continued raiding/spamflooding activities of the people from mafia spinoffs that would be both meta and on topic as much as the standard /qa/ thread where some 4chan crossboarder on /qa/ complains about the board they just came from and would have the added benefit of not being shitposting at least at first
  i do agree on meta being offtopic outside of /qa/ thats what i told the second guy we could also say that shitposting is subjective technically the oxford definition of quality uses a standard that is indeed subjective however i strongly believe that what the worst type of shitpost is has been clearly defined a memetic retort a oneliner pretty much what i mean by whining inflammatory material that sort of thing as a rule of thumb everything above that trash should not be considered shitposting three sentences lacking insight are not a valuable contribution but are not a shitpost either  do keep in mind everything i say about shitposting is strictly related to discussion only i would not want to kill jokes  the first two examples you give are one and the same what is the point of discussing differences if not to make the better choice i also disagree with the idea of /qa/ only dealing with 4chan meta in my halfassed definition i said meta discussion should be supplied by historical knowledge as well as comparisons with other sites the previous thread about internet points does not in any way deal with 4chan but with an incredibly important facet of most existing forums and i still believe it to be at home in /qa/ /qa/ should very much take into account whatever has happened/happens in altchans and mainstream sites in part because they still affect 4chan and in part because it helps attain a better understanding of internet interactions    as a separate thing i think the war and especially the monitoring general are gay as fuck i have no issue with /qa/ being a random board it will continue to be one as long as mods dont do anything about it and i have no right to claim it ought to be this or that the record shows that a board is about whatever the userbase and the moderation wants its title and rules being only a suggestion /tv/ being the best known current example the mafia and co are objectively part of the userbase
  i am the weeb mafia
  if i understand the jist of your argument youre saying the mafias homes away from home should be part of the meta of /qa/ i cant say i agree there but i respect that some people here think that and that mods seem to tolerate it for the time being there is a history youre glossing over of the last 2 years in the life of this board and the people you say are objectively part of the userbase are objectively from other places thats only one facet of the war the rest has to do with the which factions think they have the right to claim the way things ought to be on this board as you describe through cleaning/spamflooding it and running scripts to drown out their idea of unwanted content if there was ever really a war then its always been asymmetric guerilla warfare vs shock and awe carpet bombing the disproportionate amount of anime threads on this board compared to the 4chan userbase at large which at best is neutral about anime tells a tale of occupation by agendadriven forces these are the objective facts it isnt so cut and dry as this to say the mafia and co are part of the userbase especially when some are on record as being permabanned until 2026
  if i understand the jist of your argument youre saying the mafias homes away from home should be part of the meta of /qa/  i did not say that i specifically adressed the entirety of the relevant internet as altchans and mainstream sites gross error of mine because futaba for example isnt an altchan and traditional forums are still a thing that part was completely unrelated to the mafia  before talking about the state of /qa/ theres a few things i disagree with   firstly the part about homes away from home i used the term userbase a user can browse a board and not consider it his home but he is still part of the userbase macmillian defines user base as the number of people who use a particular product or service especially one available on the internet to be part of the userbase you do not need to identify with board culture you dont even need to fit in you only need to post that is why i say that mafiosi are objectively part of the userbase i am not passing a value judgement because being a user holds no worth a home is wherever the user wants it to be and is completely irrelevant the user goes wherever it goes and does whatever it wants its home is not a shackle and will be part of the userbase anywhere he visits had i used the term community it would be a valid complaint but community and userbase are two different things  secondly bans dont hold any value either they lack legitimacy because the mods are inconsistent tyrants who do whatever they want without a care in the world and lack weight due to how easily they are evaded we dont need to quote all the caps of unfair bans and unjustly deleted threads do we thats why i do not believe bans serve as a justification or support for any argument  1/2
  also i suck dicks  2/2
  now /qa/ itself this part is personal no attempt at being objective and its pretty much blogging  i never bought the narrative of the evil weebs vs the cool frogs im not blind i saw the purges very clearly but something was always amiss why would they hate meta why would they stay here if it makes them so mad nobody does that ive been called a concernbro for asking about what was up a samefag for agreeing with someone antimafia an ironic weeb for funposting and a mafia henchman for doubting that they were to blame for the bee spam its all so suspicious i saw frogposting as fruitless spam vapid cancer repetitive grinding i saw the twenty three frog posts in this pic i took almost a sixth of the catalog and i all saw was a flaming pile of garbage theres decent threads in /qa/ all the time why did they feel the need to spam instead of making actual threads they didnt accomplish anything i used to hide threads some months ago i think 146 is the highest i went because i thought it was all garbage now i dont hide anything and recently i read some posters who laughed because they posted both anime and frogs acted like any other shitstirrer ive seen and even more recently  i saw yaya post in the internet points thread and realized that the bumpbot that kept  alive is the very same one that bumped the /qa/ cafe but i had also read that chuuni guy threatening to spam the board for fun the only possible conclusion i got was that the mafia does not exist theres multiple people posting in /qa/ some of them get into chatrooms and play together but there is no monolithic group hellbent on spamming /qa/ theres an avatarfag insisting on how mad they are and how little control they have while he spends his hours gloating over nothing a bunch of people roleplaying having a laugh and some newcomers who take it seriously thats about it i only know that you can still discuss meta with them here
  ill suck yours if you suck mine  ///
  i do yes
    the person youre talking to is the insane incel frgger after spending all his time spamming about weeb whatever truth lies fiction or reality dont matter hes a broken record that cant stop cause hes insane hes the /qa/ version of other spammers except hes insane spamming about something that doesnt exist    i think at some point he maybe thought the mods would do something he was getting public banned and dabbed on by everybody nowadays who knows what goes through his demented mind all he can do is create further fiction to go along with his imaginary world
  i guess we will agree to disagree there is never as many frog threads and most of them are parodies and even then all of the frog threads are of higher quality than asking for the 48th consecutive time what youre watching this season or dreamed about last night  the mafia does not exist  there is no monolithic group hellbent on spamming /qa/  im sorry but thats just ridiculous you can go see them bragging about it in old threads on desuarchive /meta/ right now they are clearly an organized group of posters whether or not they all come from the same spinoff
  blacked ps4 frg game  higher quality than mundane question thread  such a sad little porn addict incel frgoid why is every frgger addicted to blacked porn really freaky
    cant you let the adults have a conversation for a while
  who is the adults youre a incel frgger addicted to black porn so much you actually just replied its higher quality than mundane questions    youre mentally unfit to even take care of yourself
  go fap to your cartoon waifu and leave this thread alone
  i take it this was never a conversation
  /qa/  question  answer  thats the board name incel frg blacked porn addict remove the pictures entirely and those anime threads are just random mundane questions which fit the name of the board meanwhile youre such a mental porn addict you actually replied to somebody that a blacked porn game thread is higher quality even if youve got a weird fetish dont involve others in your sickness    whats the longest time youve talked with another human before they started to hate you
  no it was i wasnt ever going to be convinced of anything but i enjoyed hearing the other posters viewpoint      i have no idea what you are talking about i cant decide if its easier for you in thinking every frogposter is the same person or if that makes life on /qa/ difficult for you when confronted with evidence to the contrary
  you must one of the most boring trolls out there you obviously try to make lengthy baits but it just doesnt work flinging shit at you is simply not worth the time
  huh what kind of mental shit are you writing now you being stupid and unable to read extremely simple english doesnt mean everybody else cant i never said anything about how many frggers are on /qa/     i only talked about how youre a incel frgger blacked porn addict who thinks thats higher quality than a mundane question thread everybody with two eyes can read and see what has happened bringing up your random schizo paranoia doesnt trick anybody
  i just want to discuss meta in a genuine manner
  i only talked about how youre a incel frgger blacked porn addict  believe it or not im honestly not that person whoever that person is will laugh hysterically when they inevitably read your post though i hope its at least half as funny for them as it is for me
  well then tell people who post shitty random threads like  and  to fuck off regardless of the op image
  whats the longest youve talked with another human in person before they started to hate you
  longer than youve been alive
  you never had a friend obviously but i mean can you interact with other people without them hating you within a couple hours did you ever wonder if everybody hates you because how you are
  shouldnt you be shiling for people to join your steamgroup instead of arguing with imaginary frogposters who live in your head
  i dont mean steam or discord im not talking about being socially awkward or shy i mean when i read your post i suddenly realized you should be a person who others legitimately hate after talking with you in person i always thought theres all sorts of people in the world so even they could find somebody a thought suddenly struck me though and made me think youre probably somebody everybody hates when they look at you    like imagining your voice and face as you say that kind of garbage sophistry just yuck
why are redditors overusing the term incel these days so much anyway
  thats funny because i was reading all of your posts in filthy franks voice ironically
  doesnt he have like millions of subscribers and large popularity among certain people i dont really take that an insult the world is big with a huge variety in people thats why i always felt strange reading people saying stuff like everybody hates them    seeing how evasive you are though im just going to take it as a yes you should be the kind of person who posts on /r9k/ about how everybody hates you i didnt get it until i read you posts
  so what other insights have you gleaned with your keen sense of reading people this gonna be good
  what keen skills other people can look at your face and start hating you i read how many of your trash posts before i realized youre somebody nobody likes im slow on the uptake
  what if youre wrong
  nothing changes you still have to wake up everyday and see yourself in the mirror maybe you dont see yourself in the mirror everyday since you dont bathe though you still have to be you
  youve really thought this out let nobody say you dont have a vivid imagination
    yikes you must really hate waking up as yourself you being you is enough punishment i wont continue to pound the dead horse  kicks one last time  okay really finished now  jump on a piece of cardboard and fly away
  yikes  back to /r/eddit you must go
  does astronomy not exist because its unrelated to economic studies  no it doesnt exist in the field of economic study  to claim that this is true meta there has to be a topic to discuss that isnt meta
  wasnt thinking id reply to this thread but i thought id give you a genuine response to what you decided to address rather than just try to stir you in the wrong direction i completely agree with your assessment of most of the stuff on /qa/ being people just having fun people seem to take it easy in the real sense by not paying much mind to their anger and just posting whatever in the spirit of having a good time unless a mod decides to piss on them of course from what ive seen on /qa/ most everyone does consider good meta discussion to be fun thats why even when all the catalogs supposedly taken up by the weeb mafia theres still meta threads that survive with a good number of posters in them i mean they dont just come out of thin air whenever a meta threads made and as youve said all the bumpbots keep meta threads alive as well the only person who ive actually seen that tends to come off as genuinely aggressive and upset is the one youd been trying to have a conversation with always says he wants nothing but the best for the board yet seemingly posts nothing but threads he calls parody and will defend them to the grave its funny that the irc and steamgroup were brought up since i remember when /qa/ was really shit and devoid of meta i actually had some interesting meta conversations in that channel and the steamgroup which im pretty sure is publicly available for anyone to view seems to just be about games shows and occasional comments about posting on /qa/ if those groups were supposed to be the mafia coordinating attacks on /qa/ then i guess im blind  also on a side note this is just a hunch of mine but im pretty sure at least one of the shit stirrers ironically hails from a /jp/ spinoff themselves merorin though theyre probably in the camp of doing it for shits and giggles not to fight some kinda holy war like others seem to be
steamgroup  stopped reading there
  this is a board for complaining it isnt supposed to be fun you are also making the same mistake the previous sperglord does in thinking only one person is sick and tired of the outside group of people who think this place is for fun random threads some people only want to discuss serious 4chan issues     there is no he the people you think are he are other 4chan crossboarders who clash with the weeb mafia because the weeb mafia has no idea what modern 4chan culture is like outside of /jp/ furthermore they dont care and think /jp/ content should be prioritized over every other kind of content out of some vague revisionist history about this being muh anime site     you dont know who posts what if you think i only post parody threads i havent even made one in more than 2 months     ultimately it comes down to how you choose to interpret the phrase feel free to be yourself people abuse this to justify their own omg so 2drandumb xd shitposting when most likely hiro/mods was only talking about things like the test thread
  i agree with this post
  i forgot to say i cannot deny that a coordinated group has raided /qa/ and you cannot deny at least one bumpbot has lifted meta threads this doesnt make sense unless you consider that random posters are not part of a single coherent group you adress all touhou posters all anime posters and all random posters in general as part of the same group and thats wrong    the metaphore is irrelevant i gave you two definitions you havent adressed  people can have a discussion about they way in which they have a discussion thats meta thats the topic    you guys gotta stop calling him the freak and accusing him of samefagging it makes everything worse    you are also making the same mistake the previous sperglord does in thinking only one person is sick and tired of the outside group of people who think this place is for fun random threads  never said that  either way what would your ideal /qa/ look like
  you cannot deny at least one bumpbot has lifted meta threads  bumping a tiny selection of meta threads that passed the bot runners ideological filter literally doesnt matter    not a single one of those threads actually lived because being being instantly buried onto page 2 is a death sentence for metathreads by the time it receives an automated bump four hours later everybody in the discussion has long since moved on to be reburied onto page two again in another three minutes
either way what would your ideal /qa/ look like  2015 /qa/ was my personal ideal /qa/ the weeb regulars back then respected that crossboarders came here to vent sometimes without sperging out and posting mod screenshots out of some boogeyman fear of old /q/ magically coming back      not a single one of those threads actually lived because being being instantly buried onto page 2 is a death sentence for metathreads  you know this isnt true for all of them and you dont help it by making 50 random anime threads which slide the meta threads quickly off the board this board is supposed to be slow
  they didnt live mostly because people made fifty anime blog threads which pushed the meta threads off the board    its not rocket science
the bumpbot is here multiple threads have been bumped with unrelated movies titles and 400 lbs thread hit bump limit with anime pics all posts date to 12 hours ago
  yes the worst offenders have been on all night sliding the board
    hes absolutely seething   
  they are going to wake up in the morning and find that all of their spinoff trash has been once again archived and deleted
this goes up for obvious reasons
bumpbot is back sliding in full effect big surprise it looks like another wave is imminent when the catalog fills back up
  i think we can all agree on some things    1 /qa/ has always been a place for meta  2 theres nothing inherently wrong with /jp/ posts  25 but making random threads for no apparent purpose is rude and doing it to bump off other threads is malicious  3 frogposter has no place on the board  4 botfag has always been one dude and he has no place on the board either  5 people and idiots will always use /qa/ to vent the only thing regulars can do is ignore them  6 hiro will sometimes post and /qa/ will be totaled for some weeks then things go back to normal and theres no need to try and force the issue    theres less than 40 regulars we can all perfectly share a 10x15 threads space if we agree to make an effort to coexist
  you cant say that and not link the threads
  not a single one of those threads actually lived because being being instantly buried onto page 2 is a death sentence for metathreads by the time it receives an automated bump four hours later everybody in the discussion has long since moved on to be reburied onto page two again in another three minutes    thread watcher my dude slow boards cant live without it      i forgot to say i cannot deny that a coordinated group has raided /qa/ and you cannot deny at least one bumpbot has lifted meta threads this doesnt make sense unless you consider that random posters are not part of a single coherent group you adress all touhou posters all anime posters and all random posters in general as part of the same group and thats wrong  i think theres only one bot dude and its the same dude that stalks the cabal and spammed bosn till the mods lost their cools and banned the word forever hes more or less responsible for half the shitflinging on this board whether or not hes weeb frog teen or completely unrelated dudes a cancer    no denying there once was multiple spin off groups on /qa/ but i think most of them have lost their interest on the board and returned to their bunkers as a matter of fact id dare say the remaining ones can no longer bump threads by themselves    you guys gotta stop calling him the freak and accusing him of samefagging it makes everything worse  theres definitely falseflag threads going around but i dont know if they are frogposters or botfag    either way the boards mostly peaceful nowadays except for these dedicated ban evaders    either way what would your ideal /qa/ look like  basically /internet/ not just 4chan but overall internet culture well thats mostly just 4chan
   by not paying much mind to their anger  my experience with the /jp/ types is the opposite they are angry all the time but pretend they are not loaded with genuine mistrust of outsiders and unlike most people they dont say anything and act passive aggressive about shit lots of resentment and unspoken grudges of the unhealthy kind     unless a mod decides to piss on them of course  disagree mods barely care about this board the extent of their interest is using it as a way to fix hiroyukis 1 meta thread per board fuck up maybe one or two browse the board in the hunt for things that remind them of the days when they still had personalities but that is only speculation    what they do care however is about waging the attrition war against ban evaders and rulebreakers and they are keenly aware of the spin off raids on this board maliciously bumping off not /jp/ type threads so in their eyes they are just deleting raider threads some of which are admittedly by serial evaders i mean we have the likes of bosn and frogposter here theres virtually no way to pretend their posts arent 100 malicious      his is a board for complaining it isnt supposed to be fun  meta can definitely be fun mostly nostalgic and srs bsns but it can be fun    i really think we need to understand that tourists coming to vent are not part of /qa/ just background noise that should be ignored    ho clash with the weeb mafia because the weeb mafia has no idea what modern 4chan culture is like outside of /jp/  sadly true  they dont care and think /jp/ content should be prioritized over every other kind of content out of some vague revisionist history about this being muh anime site  sadly very true       and you cannot deny at least one bumpbot   not gonna lie i still havent seen any evidence of this bumpbot only bots i know are the /gw2g/ type floodbot that targeted some threads and the proxy list bot that wipes the floor clean of threads
  not gonna lie i still havent seen any evidence of this bumpbot  then youre an astroturfing samefag accomplice who regrettably arrived to the bargaining table 1 year too late
   the monitoring general are gay as fuck  oi the happenings thread has been here pretty much since day 1 have some respect      i think raiding /qa/ was a meme among spin offs and now the memes mostly dead and whoever remains just browses regularly and happens to like spin off culture      i agree with this post weird as it seems      talking to my mirror the post      m8 half the spin offs hate each other theres no coordinated weeb assault group theres a bunch of distinct communities that thought raiding /qa/ was funny for a time
  ive seen countless references to bots but never seen their quoted posts and never seen attempts to report them or call them out    on the other hand ive seen seen the flood bots and the targeted copypaste bots and have evidence of both hell ive seen the later bot used to raid spin offs    1 year too late  nigger ive been here since the 4chan panel got this board created
  i agree that the weeb mafia is not monolithic and not constantly in sync with one another i never said they were an attack squad some are too retarded for that or dont care at all i also know that not everyone on /ota/ and the other spinoffs cares about /qa/ and rigs the /qa/ catalog regularly like certain other people do     however you cannot deny that there is an organized attempt to force this board into being 2d random and its been going on for over a year more like two it starts with the never ending cycle of necro bumping all the wanted content to the top of the catalog and then forcing everything you dont like off by making 40100 inane shitposting threads at a time while they are doing this they constantly tell every crossboarder to fuck off this is the only board for crossboarders to come and talk about 4chan problems and if they dont like it they need to leave not the other way around    they have tried to justify this behavior as self moderation but then gave up the pretense and just calling it what it was spamming/spamflooding thus we live in the era of asukaspammer the people who arent from /qa/ but run the qa irc channel and spam the stream links here every weekend are all part of the same group weeb mafia and these same people have been doing this for two years no matter how times they use /qa/ as an adjective in their roleplaying and no matter how many irc channels and steamgroups they name after /qa/ they will never be /qa/ they are from elsewhere some have been permabanned and/or shunned on their home board /jp and they shouldnt be representing anything about this place when they dont belong on 4chan at all    pic related was from earlier today
  most of the regulars here wouldnt dispute that there is a bumpbot because weve all seen it go crazy and bump everything before half of all the deleted posts on desuarchive at this moment that arent part of the recent series of spamfloods are at least one of the bumpbots especially the single deleted posts that look like anime titles or names of old nintendo games
  and not constantly in sync with one another  thats one hell of an understatement    i one began to ask around to try and understand the whole phenomenon the /jp/ shitstorm that started it all didnt just end after they left /jp/ a number of spin offs regulars are clearly resentful of others even if they never admit it and generally try to dissuade people from asking about the boards it also turns out they cant help but talk whenever spin offs are mentioned    seriously the term misunderstood geniuses applies 11    however you cannot deny that there is an organized attempt to force this board into being 2d random  i wouldnt call it organized id say in fact thats a handful of dudes who have a similar attitude/mentality talking 5 peeps or even less  if you havent noticed people here have and some posts in the very thread show it a narrative that the mods specifically target them and that frogposter is the woe of all /qa/ i dont think they do this as an organized gorilla warfare attempt but rather because they are bored and want to spice up their posting habits id go as far as to say that any conflict with the mods is 100 manufactured and the only real interaction they had outside thread deletion was the mods getting fed up with the bosn kid frogposter is sadly a real person     it starts with the never ending cycle of necro bumping all the wanted content to the top of the catalog and then forcing everything you dont like off by making 40100 inane shitposting threads at a time  this ive seen and ive seen it in the spin offs too its like a general behavior    pic  eh i idle that channel and i can confirm these guys are not the problem or at least not a meaningful problem they only relevant thing that chat has going is that the a bot spammer idles it hell the very board that thread alludes to was botspammed 10 minutes into its creation that guy has also spammed qa itself and 4chan too
  2    while they are doing this they constantly tell every crossboarder to fuck off this is the only board for crossboarders to come and talk about 4chan problems and if they dont like it they need to leave not the other way around    i shall take a third side to this argument crossposters are genuinely not interested in talking meta not even in improving their boards or 4chan which would be the point of this kind of meta but rather just come here to vent and try to convince people to follow they narrative where x group is doing y thing and they are totally comploting to destroy my board because i hide the fact i cant handle people liking things i dont like and reeee mods stop changing things hiro is the combined lifeforce of every jew alive dead and yet to be born they simply dont post in good faith and just want people to agree with them and give them back pats    these guys are basically background noise and its virtually impossible to get a pleasant conversation out of them they dont care about anything that doesnt follow their internal telenovela and sadly they are commonplace across all 4chan now worst of all they dont even come here anymore they get shoved by the mods while i dont condone telling them to fuck off i simply see engaging them at all as a waste of time    like you can instantly notice when someone asks a genuine question / interest and when someone comes to vent compare  and  to     era of asukaspammer   the people who arent from /qa/ but run the qa irc channel and spam the stream links  not familiar with these i used to work on weekends until very recently    though i think we can take for a fact that all the spin offs know all the other spin offs including ircs doesnt mean they actually like each other also a number of them named the boards /qa/ as part of the meme ie trevor      im not very keen on archive browsing unless its something concrete can you link me examples
  not him but as he said   half of all the deleted posts  literally the other half is lee          etc    scroll next 10 pages  its been like that for 22 months
  these guys are basically background noise and its virtually impossible to get a pleasant conversation out of them they dont care about anything that doesnt follow their internal telenovela and sadly they are commonplace across all 4chan now worst of all they dont even come here anymore they get shoved by the mods while i dont condone telling them to fuck off i simply see engaging them at all as a waste of time    personally i see them as a source of endless shadenfreude and maybe occasionally one of their questions is so basic that even i could answer it i dont mind i get how most people wouldnt care about these people and just ignore there is no reason to be openly hostile toward them like certain people are even worse there are a few people here who think if crossboarders are allowed it means this is somehow /q/ and feel compelled to remind everyone constantly that mods dont respond here    there is one person who spamfloods with asuka avatars he has been refereed to as the weeb mafia enforcer before by more than one person to illustrate the terrible pall he casts over /qa/ look at the most posted images          can you link me examples  this is a typical example of one of the bumpbots in action this was last monday           if there is only one person doing it then sometimes it bumps different things sometimes everything but usually only threads with an anime op pic i suspect there are at least 3 skiddies running them maybe more one poster used to brag about his scriptmaking abilities heretif you keep scrolling through the pages of deleted posts you can see this sort of thing has been going for over a year almost two
  ive seen countless references to bots but never seen their quoted posts and never seen attempts to report them or call them out          these three are only one of approximately 200 text strings that the bot used to bump threads it later switched to using images after mods cracked down on the text this bot was running for a whole fucking year and its seriously fucking unbelievable that you could have failed to notice it
  redditor  old boogeyman find something new please
  agh fuck you leatherman
one of the so called weeb mafia here since there is actual discussion taking place ill break silence on the subject       i dont see what is nefarious about a channel named qa linking to a thread on /qa/ its also not a singular group i dont use steam and ive never been to a spinoff yet others do and have obviously i came to 4chan before /jp/ even existed let alone /qa/ if someone is from /qa/ that means theyve only been here a couple years    they constantly tell every crossboarder to fuck off  ive seen this many times but dont personally engage in it its rude and unnecessary given that in many cases the threads were moved here      the bump bot is real and there is likely more than one       id say in fact thats a handful of dudes who have a similar attitude/mentality  pretty much id also say that attitude extends to what  said about crossposters and venting/bitching about moderation vs actual meta threads this is why there is no remorse when those false meta threads end up being replaced by a random 2d thread this is seen as doing the site a service    a narrative that the mods specifically target them   i see this a lot but ive personally never had much of a problem
  this is seen as doing the site a service  this my spam  your spam attitude and positive opinions only attitude should all go burn in a fire somewhere
  its not seen as spam vs spam but rather funposting vs whining about 4chan /qa/ is fun thats why im here
weeby uh they say theyre iffy uh  but i aint about that trap shit nuh  yuh  spam is ok when i do it  suck a dick or two  fuckos worse than a rootkit  uh no but slim why you gotta hate  sorry mom i just spammed the board and snorted crack cocaine  i get really angsty when i see the green  guys dont know the extent of a lean teen machine  yeah thats right im all about the spam  catch me in irc fangirling worse than stans  no they dont hear ya mods are dead  fuck a loli bitch or two  whats wrong  oh right they just deleted my thread  im too drunk to be alive morphine diapers pills everything deprived  no fuck you i aint about that shit  because they catch it archived  im gonna make you kneel while i spit  no slim why you gotta do this weeb mafia secret govermnent everything but you just keep on pulling it  i take it eazye frens dont catch me raging in the thread no i clown you harder than those messed up flows  oh wait you linked it in the archive  ignore it boys we gonna bury that guy alive  plugs mic off  im out
  mph thanks  im curious about how the got deleted in the first place same ip vpn autistic mod    also what triggers the text spam and what triggers the image only spam      is it inspired from a japanese board  doesnt seem like he spamfloods more like downvotes threads cant say i find it worthy of mention id only question why hed bother doing it    if there is only one person doing it then sometimes it bumps different things  i think he has a text randomizer based off a library he modifies himself ive seen this bot pattern before when he raided 4chan basically he givens them a library of words and phrases to choose from and they mix them up a bit that one works for bosn bot i assume he also runs a separate library that doesnt get randomized    i dont know for sure who he is but i think his mo is discernible dont expect more than one person with a rather customized script id be surprised if there where more talking about /qa/ regulars      this bot was running for a whole fucking year and its seriously fucking unbelievable that you could have failed to notice it  i have an incredibly rare ability i can ignore threads that dont interest me i also wasnt as keenly aware of which post is a bot and which isnt as i am now only figured them out after i realized captcha is bypassable    what the fuck is this fucking spam half the board was just bumped by a bot pulling from a generator with a limited dictionary each quote is the entire post for each one look at the post numbers how difficult can it be to spot this happening and prevent posts made only from this dictionary from being posted  seems like im not the only one who noticed it    the only thing i cant seem to figure out is if theres a specific trigger or the bumpbot affects threads at random or all at the same time    also 2hu references kek      all in all i honestly think that if we do without the bot all involved parties can coexist
  this is why there is no remorse when those false meta threads end up being replaced by a random 2d thread this is seen as doing the site a service  the problem is that the tactics used also fuck with everything else there should be remorse about that otherwise you dont foster community but rather antagonism
  this is why there is no remorse when those false meta threads end up being replaced by a random 2d thread   whining about moderation is meta 2d/random isnt
  im curious about how the got deleted in the first place same ip vpn autistic mod  through the magic or reports system /qa/ is one of the few boards where it seems to work  also what triggers the text spam and what triggers the image only spam  the only thing i cant seem to figure out is if theres a specific trigger or the bumpbot affects threads at random or all at the same time  whenever its creator is triggered gets btfo or feels threatened he calls out for the bot  coexist  that is how this board lives theres 1015 threads for them to play with frogs have their 35 the rest is metaish topics of various degrees of quality its fairly peaceful until they get out of line and a mod has to step in to soothe them
  frogposter does nothing on good faith desu all he does do can be done without needlessly provoking others
  see 
  i imagine most people that post frogs on /qa/ do it as a countermeasure when the blogspam is becoming unbearable i never cared for the image of frogs but i cant tolerate it when this board is getting wiped with countless /qa/ and cute boys threads so ill gladly bump the green its all a matter of selfmoderation which some say is dead    the real frogposter doesnt post that often anymore he has a very specific set of images and his posts are often quite expansive and amusing
  they arent even a blip on the radar compared to the might of kekistan i wouldnt worry
  all of the frog threads are of higher quality than asking for the 48th consecutive time what youre watching this season or dreamed about last night  this is what /r9k/ retards actually believe reposting the same shitty meme thread one that isnt even from /qa/ originally is something so fucking low quality that it managed to get pepe banned from multiple boards
  are you seriously unironically trying to say  is better than  you should not be posting here at all if you think this
  not him but that first threads perfect i mean look at how pretty lala is
  and its in bluray quality too so its not blurry at all just look at the difference in quality
  unironically yes what the frog in your thread is complaining about is the fact that his what are some movies shitpost threads that hes made every day for the past two years have began to be deleted for being so low quality and repetitive that you could get a spambot to do it that thread you linked amounts to why was i banned for breaking gr6 im new here and whats the 4chan irc    if hes not larping and really believes he has a case he should go to the irc channel not farting about it on /qa/
  why nobody is going to suddenly archive the thread because it doesnt fit in with the board   cough
  you are literally crazy the first thread is fulfilling the purpose of the board the second is off topic shitposting just stop posting threads at all if you think the second thread is quality it objectively isnt jesus half the people on this board like yourself could benefit from lurking another 6 months before posting again
ummm
ive got a question for all 可愛い蛙 here do you consider all supposed weebs bad or would you just want some of them to leave say for instance would you prefer  leave /qa/ forever as much as  or maybe  as much as  is your standard that someone must post with a frog/nonanime picture to be legitimate to you
  read the sticky nonfrogs make the same threads and i tell them the same thing i dont give a fuck about the first thread but the second leaks of newfaggotry and the only reason you defend it at all is because it has a picture of your favorite meme on the op you would be agreeing with me wholeheartedly if it was an anime pic there instead
  oh my god read the fucking thread retard the frog thread does not ask any help or response from the mods its just some guy that came here to vent which is okay first and foremost he asked questions and with this being a question  answer board it is perfectly fine   actually both those threads have the right to be on this board as per hiros sticky but the very fact that it was probably created by an offsite ban evader cannot be tolerated
  you keep trying to make it about the anime when even people from /a/ and /jp/ hate you you dont have to be a frog meme to understand how you are purposely trying to mislead people
  for a second lets assume that the person who made the frog complaint thread was actually banned from all boards and in making that thread was banevading would that inturn make him an offsite ban evader as well
the weeb mafia truly is hcking insane i seriously suggest you dont interact with these people in any capacity whatsoever
  no of course the first and third threads are infinitely more preferable than the second and fourth threads /qa/ has always had weebs and some of those old chill weebs are still here but in the first half of 2017 an outside group of blacklisted weebs from spinoffs started coming here and trying to scare off crossboarders and rig the catalog the second and fourth threads you posted are either the work of this group or one of the idiots they have attracted here through shitposting for almost two years
  not part of your stupid larp war i dont give a shit about what the weebs think about me but youve collectively wiped your asses with the rules for multiple years now and are acting shocked when the jannies have finally began to call your bluff and delete your content as needed    do you honestly expect me to feel sympathetic to you when you defend your right to post this anal grease cross the site  is either a purpose shitposter or too much of a retard to realize his sperging goes against the rules
  yeah but that dude is a shithead and responsible for a good number of the vitriol and attempts at blog spam i agree that /qa/ definitely has a bait problem      both sides are persona non grata on the irc mostly because they are both serial evaders and it triggers the mods immensely       the first thread is fulfilling the purpose of the board  1 /qa/s explicit purpose is to be the meta dump thread and the only one the mods care to defend  2 /qa/ is also allowed to make whatever thread they want theres no such thing as off topic shitposting applicable for /qa/      i like things done in good faith regardless of how one does them
  hes back to pretending its all just roleplaying again  youre so predictable  see   and   and 
  1 /qa/s explicit purpose is to be the meta dump thread and the only one the mods care to defend  where do you people get this shit from /qa/ is the customer support and complaint board and if you dont like it what the hell are you still doing here there are dozens of spinoffs that would love your traffic there is no reason for you to shitpost here or engage in a two year failed crusade to turn this into 2drandom
    /qa/ is neither of those things you morons read the sticky    it is a meta board nothing more nothing less    he  sorry boyo im not part of the meme war i just see it as a convinient excuse for both sides to shitpost when they otherwise have nothing to actually say on /qa/
  here do you people get this shit from  4chan irc word from the mods themselves  just go ask them theyll pretty much tell you something along the lines of its the place meta threads get moved to followed by why would you even browse that shit board and accusations of being a shitposter    /qa/ is the customer support and complaint board and if you dont like it what the hell are you still doing here there are dozens of spinoffs that would love your traffic there is no reason for you to shitpost here or engage in a two year failed crusade to turn this into 2drandom  falseflag nice try tho      /qa/ is neither of those things you morons read the sticky  this is a board for the discussion of meta topics and  other things  outside of meta this board has no specific theme and you are free to be yourself  literally   1 /qa/s explicit purpose is to be the meta dump thread and the only one the mods care to defend  2 /qa/ is also allowed to make whatever thread they want theres no such thing as off topic shitposting applicable for /qa/    read the /qa/ rules also or you think this board doesnt have any
    shit was already brought up 2 years ago told those nuweebs to post here if they wanted but then they started to have a mental breakdown because their threads were inactive as fuck and started to through a hissy fit and now it evolved into some weird obsession of raiding this board
  i just see it as a convinient excuse for both sides to shitpost when they otherwise have nothing to actually say on /qa/  this is /qa/ in a nutshell
  im sure i can speak for everyone in this thread when we say your interpretation of the rules and sticky is horribly flawed and wrong and were all very grateful you arent a mod or a janitor
  i think your opinion matters not if you cant bring up a counterargument
  read the thread jackass
  you cant distinguish who posts almost all the content on the thread is literally a three way debate between me and two other dudes
  read the /qa/ rules also or you think this board doesnt have any  well fuck me i actually just double checked and theres no rules for this board written on 4chanorg/rules/
  when i see you are self enforcing your perverted interpretation of the rules later with the usual catalog tricks i will be sure to remember how you and two other dudes worked it all out in this thread while you are doing that the crossposters will keep coming and the meta threads are going to be moved here because this is still the meta board it will keep being the meta board long after you get bored and go back to the hole you came from i take great comfort from this
  im not who you think i am mr schizo
tenis
scary thread
  there is a systematic organized attempt to take over this board  lol  so what what exactly are you doing on this board that you would even remotely care about some loosely organized weebs taking it over for whatever reason do you have some actual genuine concern over the purpose of a useless meta board or are you just a tribalistic kid who found something to pick a side and fight about are you so far into this fictional war that you dont even realize thats what happened
  i think this board is useless so im going to ruin it for everyone  who made you the one who decides what is useless
  then what use is it to you what are you really getting out of this board that youre obsessed over some weebs taking it over or whatever
  its the meta board stupid its in the sticky for fucks sake
  okay then its the meta board what the fuck do you care about some weebs
    they flood the board and spam meta threads retard
  yeah so do other people the frogposters come immediately to mind dont see you bitching about them or anyone else that does it
  shouldnt you be posting google image searched concern pictures
  shouldnt you be avoiding my questions a little harder
  is this where you pretend frogs are as bad as weebspammers again how about you pretend you dont know what anyone is talking about and ask for proofs again what about playing the neutral observer thats always a classic    you need some new strategies
he has no sense of self meaning the only thing he could imagine posting on a board for being yourself and meta is meta
  and you need to just admit that the only people you dont want spamming the board are weebs no amount of insinuating that im somehow a part of this fucking pathetic fake board culture war is going to change that i just wanted to know why it was weebs in particular that trigger you when everybody and their mother spams this garbo board
  sigh we already went through this  see  and burn that textbook of generic debate tactics youre getting this crap from
cricket chirping intensifies  yep as i figured just more dumb tribalism from the kiddos  le pepe frogger posse vs muh weeb mafiaosiososz  gotta pick a side gotta fit in  not even s4s does this shit
  he cannot be reasoned with
    only weebshits spam the board the last time a mod came to take down all the spambots and idiotic imagedumps almost all frog threads disappeared because they were always nothing but a reaction to spam
  only weebshits spam the board
  mods delete frog threads  rationalize it by thinking it was because the frog threads are ontopic  youre just pretending right someone cant be that delusional
  only weebshits spam the board  proceeds to contradict this statement within the same sentence  am i being rused
  they are spamming it right now with useless threads like   
                  i lost the plot whos arguing with who again
    theyre baiting and trying to get the thread to bump limit dont fall for it
  oh no i hope it didnt kill yet another thread with pepe getting ready to ting ting make an important announcement
  dont play into this kids schizophrenia its not healthy
  not sure myself i just chime in when it suits me
  all of those threads are better than all of these threads get to bumping your bump bot is banned now and you know mods are watching
  all of those threads are better than all of these threads  no theyre all pretty trash but thats the point who cares there arent enough 4chan regulars who want to have meta discussion so this place ends up a shitposting hive people are going to spam dumbass frogs and cartoon waifus welcome to 4chan the fact that you think this is some sort of culture war is fucking baffling to me
  thats mostly because the former regular and semiregular meta posters were run off by walltowall spam and bots
  how will this website ever recover truly the anime girl frogpocalypse is upon us  ronpaul_couldhavestoppedthistiff
  obviously a lot of people care or else there wouldnt be almost 60 people in this thread alone
  60 people  a lot  even by 4chan standards  i really am being rused
  subarashii
  you guys really like pushing this weird kids buttons dont you
  dont forget to at least halve the number to account for ip changes
  lel board just got fast for some odd reason hmmm
im not reading any of that
    the mod didnt delete any frog threads actually they were naturally pushed off the board and no more were made because there was no need to
based
  alt is a fucking cunt fuck that guy to death
hes awake right now
  what about loli cartels
  naturally
  dang i miss a day of /qa/ and i miss a mod going crazy again  how do they know
                like clockwork
                      absolute buttdevastation
maybe
  found the mafioso
what was it that got deleted
  lolis are banned though so that cant be possible
  some of its interesting but the last 1/3rd sucked
  well cartels are not exactly known for being licit
  but most normal people dont like lolis
  and you can get lolis for free on the internet so how is there any market for them
  its pretty impressive how far mods will go to make /qa/ worse
  you make /qa/ worse and then mods fix it
  nah mods rarely act in a positive manner towards /qa/  its a board seen as a trash can to them
  its a trash can only because youre here treating it like its a random board when it isnt
  trash can that arguably gets more mod attention and supervision than most other real boards is hardly a trash can
hes not a christian he never was
hes not chrischan
  if hes not thats a plus
christfags  ill pass
  he was anti israelthats enough
  wasnt obama a muslim or something    he was anti israel  source or i dont believe you
  hes a satanist
why wasnt he a christian again
  his father or something black rights movements are also tied to islam in america since a sect of blacks wanted to return to a more african ideal as rebels against the white christian norn
  because hes a satanist
  op here  im confirming all of the above answers
  hes a nigger
  because his parents named him barack  christian is a different name
  hes a dirty slime
  whats wrong with slime
upload failed
  huh
  this was meant for 
not one mention    not one single person posted it in the whole thread
  
regardless of swings in popularity over the decades does anime hold essentially a position of counterculture in the west
no its still a niche and is likely going to remain that way forever or at least until japan is over
i take it you meant to write yes instead of no based on the rest of your sentence
it can be interpreted either way japans own culture is being rapidly replaced by that of the west perhaps in 50 years there wont be anything left of what can be seen as genuinely japanese and if anime lives that long itd be sure to capture it
is poetry counterculture are performance arts counterculture everythings a matter of perspective and from my point of view id describe you as a bloody baboon for being so petty
no anime is mainstream in every way     
  but they also adopt lots things from western culture and do their own unique things with them anime is itself an example of that
  nope
  dropping any absurd angles the question is of course placed in relation to commonplace and popular culture in the west      that is interesting but not the point of my question besides what  said is true japan has a history of importing things and japanifying them they are far more resilient than you think
anime is great
  nice
  quints for truth i guess
  bless this get
  ok this is based

  its certainly not mainstream it peaks and troughs right now its peaking inasmuch as its been swept along for the ride with the rest of the mainstream nerd movement but it still hasnt really broken through this might be the biggest peak financially because theres more money to be made now in the whole commercialization of nerd media especially with crunchyroll faster licensing videogame localizations and live action movies but its not the most feverish peak weve had weebs do not occupy the same place in subculture now that they used to in around 20062009ish     nerd culture will never truly go back underground because too many of us in society have been raised by it but it will continue to be a background force proportionately smaller than the rest of nerd media at any given time it could perhaps be diluted and merged into western mainstream animation but most people wont recognize it as anime at that point    the bigger risk is chinese and korean companies buying out japanese studios and churning out japaneseinnameonly anime that doesnt really feel like anime japanese studios will still exist but well be left with significantly less traditional anime to choose from each season
  thats very good

  /bant/ here holy shit
you now realise that people born in the year 2000 are allowed to post here these people also call you a newfag
  i was born in 2000 you fucking newfag
  hypothetically there is still a chance youre underage
  you now realise your mindset is still from a decade ago and not the current year
  realistically there are people on here who werent even born when 4chan was made
if some irresponsible parents let their latelyliterate loli post on 2003 4chan she would be legal by now and one of the oldest oldfags here
  the real problem is people who were born before 1975
  i think literally every kind of poster is at least somewhat better than social media babies
is this what real /qa/ gfs are actually like
want to sex her on top of all that trash
shut up trevor nobody cares about your sub fetishes
  why the fuck would you think this is my thread
  sociopathic shitposting cunts who ruin other peoples lives for shits and giggles then maybe
  just wait til you see what her predecessor did in the first gridman      in the first series the bad guy makes kaiju because hes a hopeless romantic
  she doesnt ruin peoples lives just makes them have never existed at all  youre not some kind of prolife fundamentalist are you
  lmao i remember dropping this anime on the second episode
yes of course
sounds about right
the call that saved 4channel
ugh i thought this gay forced meme was dead
what is this followers feature and how do i unhide when i accidentally click it i dont understand whats why what is this followers thing
this is not ok
using quickreply    youre right they need to remove that feature i dont use it so i want it gone

reminder that this girl is 15 dont post any lewd comments about her
why is she wearing a onesie
so uhhhh what happened
are you retarded
  oh wow why are less and less people driving oldsmobiles every year
i was busy with some work stuff sorry
all the good boards get moved to 4channel  people use 4channel instead of 4chan  its that simple
  less and less  fewer and fewer
  im sorry im polish
  your post was grammatically correct  is a dumb cunt
  i think at its peak it was at 97 or 99 in the us
  grandmothers which had the alexa toolbar installed got new computers which came without them
  less goes with uncountables retard
  according to whom the usage is linguistically synonymous anyone is capable of understanding either phrase from the perspective of linguistic anthropology which trumps any arbitrary authoritative ruleset ignored by 99 of language users you are being a fucking clown
  reminds me of people who say aint isnt a word or the can/may dichotomy 23 year old elementary school teachers smugly shit on children over
  im inclined to believe that any significant decline in 4chan traffic is electionfags dropping off so it might be a combination of trump being exceptionally horrible over a short period of time followed by the two /pol/ terrorists    look at the dates dumbass 4channel wasnt even announced until last month    or they realized who theyre potentially sharing a website with
alexa isnt very reliable what do the archives say about traffic
    4channels announcement and creation precedes the graphs months
  uh no it doesnt
resetera
if you look at the past 2 years 4chans traffic has been on a steady decline back to its normal levels    during the 2016 election 4chan traffic doubled which shot it up to like the top 80 websites in the usa after the election ended traffic has been gradually decreasing back to what was normal before the election
tenhou soon  
go back there
imagine having to plan this shit like a weekly event when you could just type jong in steam chat to get 3 other people instantly

squidward is the best character

why does hiroshima think that changing the domain name will get him more advertisers wouldnt 4channel just get blacklisted
not if mods crack down on 4channel
  which they wont just right now the biggest board has had a shitposting thread about one of the biggest series for 4 hours     first you need people who dont moderate the way 4chan has been since forever
it will generate more traffic since 4chan is blacklisted in many routers as malicious changing it will allow a lot of shit posters to browse it at work/school/public spaces etc making it all sfw will also help
well this is new
not really just theyre making it clearer whats blocked
  
  not now new text
  was it always just or mostly just files and not text posts that were blocked i dont think so
is this the first day for this
  fuck off and die you piece of shit
doesnt basically all of 4chan break this rule
  banned   reason garbage outside of /b/     fucking give me a break that is some bull ass rule
thats just there to give the mds an excuse to ban whomever they please
  your standards are too high
  so is it also there so we can report whomever we please
  you can but since quality is subjective i imagine they could whack you for submitting a false report
  keyword extremely    odds are youd need to be deliberate to get banned for it ie mass replying the entire thread
  then why arent people banned for one work extermely low effort posts like  cringe  yikes  oof  nigger  cuck    etc
  then dont post garbage outside of /b/ cant be that hard unless youre the sort of garbage that can only post garbage worthy of /b/
  i bet they would be if you reported them on /a/
  most of the time its relevant to the discussion and the poster theyre answering to is indeed a cringy faggot
  no that would be something like this    lol xdxdxdxdxd    i just literally    peed    my    pants    just a litte though    i mean its a little spot not like it ruined my chair r nything lol but for real epic lulz high fives xdddddddddddddd    u frustrated u frustrated bro u so mad why are you so maaaad i can post anything i want that is how it says in the rules i dont care about your faggotry rules y so maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad    whata fuck man xd i just fall of my chair cuz i couldnt and i cant stop laugh xdxdxdxdxddddddddddddxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxddddddddddddddddddd omgosh dddddxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxdddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd dddddd looooooooolllll this is a shit xddddddddddddddddddddxddddddddddddddddddddd a big one xdddddddd a grat one xxxxxxdddd congrats man xd u frustrated u frustrated bro u so mad why are you so maaaad i can post anything i want that is how it says in the rules i dont care about your faggotry rules y so maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad    whata fuck man xd i just fall of my chair cuz i couldnt and i cant stop laugh xdxdxdxdxddddddddddddxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxddddddddddddddddddd omgosh dddddxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxdddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd dddddd looooooooolllll this is a shit hgxddddddddddddddddddddxddddddddddddddddddddd a big one xdddddddd a grat one xxxxxxdddd congrats man xd    whata fuck man xd i just fall of my chair cuz i couldnt and i cant stop laugh    xdxdxdxdxddddddddddddxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxddddddddddddddddddd omgosh    hoooooooollllllyyyyy shit    whatr the hell    whata fuck man xd    i just fall of my chair cuz i couldnt and i cant stop laugh    xdxdxdxdxddddddddddddxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxddddddddddddddddddd    omgosh dddddxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxdddddddddddddddddddddddddddd dddddd looooooooolllll    this is a shit xddddddddddddddddddddxddddddddddddddddddddd    a blg one xdddddddd a grat one xxxxxxddddlol xdxdxdxdxd    i just literally    peed    my    pants    just a litte though
  this is just a something that made a mod butthurt type of excuse
  no quality is relative even between boards although what gets banned for gr6 is 99 lq on any board for example one of those posts that replies to a dozen other with baseds and cringes
i wrote 2k words yesterday and i will keep working on life
a redditobsessed man with the mind of a small child
  go away
i wouldnt really count the amount of words you write as that much of an accomplishment if i were to total all the words from each post i make per day id probably have an average around that or higher as well
yeah i fill up the 40000 character limit on reddit all the time with inane reddit comments
  well i could say i wrote 20 pages but then people will assume im writing it on 8x115 instead of my autistic way of writing it on 55x8 style which is basically cheating
sage this shit
  good job
  thanks
now this is a christian website jews and muslims are not allowed
i went to /his/  beautiful russians  dream women from russia are looking for serious relationships and friends
  your religion will die in concept or totally like all religions have done and humans will come up with more memes to take its place
how much do you bump threads it goes without saying that ill bump a good thread if i have something to add to it but sometimes i look for good threads and think of something to add roughly speaking if    a thread is among the top 1/3 of threads on the board judging by the quality of replies i expect it to get  the thread is in the bottom 1/2 of the board  the last reply is by someone other than me    then ill try to think of something to post of course with threads on page 6 theres more time to think than for threads on page 10 and higher quality contributions can be made sometimes it helps to go to other threads and come back when ive thought of something    some will object that deliberate targeted bumping is not natural but the natural state of 4chan proliferates stale bait threads that make newfags reply in anger
typically when i have something to add to it    also when i have the time to go through a bunch and give them responses
you people have horrible taste and dont have the faintest idea of what a quality thread looks like you only bump shit and slide the good threads to the bottom often the shitty bait threads are better than the roleplaying and image dump threads with people fapping in them that you people always seem to bump
ive mostly given up the use of sage so most of my posts are bumps but in some cases i still do use it such as if what im posting has absolutely no relevance to the thread or if i feel that my reply would be bad to bump on
on /qa/ i only bump anime threads
shameless bump
google translate changed
i need it to post on 4chan
you know i find it very funny that 4chan is having its great split at the exact same time that tumblr is purging all of its nsfw content
its just a coincidence gaijin
so how many /qa/ers actually use tumblr
whats /qa/ watching this season and are you keeping up with your seasonals ive got around a weeks worth of episodes from series ive mostly been enjoying to watch but i can barely work up the motivation to do anything but sleep post and watch youtube
gob slay and jojo if youre not sick of isekai already slime tensei just sticks to the tropes but does it well
up to date with everything other than slime gonna watch the new episode in a bit and kitarou still plan to pick up anima yell and irozuku
  karakuri circus  been seeing that one mentioned a bit how is it i may try picking that up in the hopes itll snap me out of boredom
  im liking it a lot but it feels a bit rushed although i havent read the manga for what its worth the manga is by the same author as ushio to tora and is held in very high regard by japanese readers
  oh i liked ushio to tora quite a bit yeah definitely will try picking this one up
  still this stuff      are you keeping up with your seasonals  im behind on a lot of them but its pretty easy to catch up when i do get around to watching stuff
  also i picked up gridman but im not caught up yet
been playing games instead of watching but i might get to watching gridman soon
what do you think of this season compared to others
going to catch up soon
  for me its tied with winter as the best season lots of good shows and some real nice hits as well
  zombie idol and the pedo maid
only the best show this season of course
sorry i dont watch anime
ss normman
bet youre one of those hipster norms that thinks popularbad the real norm show is that bunny norm show because its being praised as a masterpiece when its just an average oregairumonogatari clone
  there are actually people who watch anime itt  kys youreselves
  what shows are you enjoying
  goblin slayer  gridman  anima yell  spyce  slime  bunny girl  karakuri circus  tonari no kyuuketsuki  uzai maid  yagate kimi ni naru  jojo  zombie land saga
  do you at least play vns or something
  notspoilerno/notspoiler
trying to catch up on zombieland  i need to start gridman  ive been reading vns and playing games a lot lately
i dont want to mention anything i like here do you understand why  that saidanyone watch himote house
  i dont understand why
seems to be an average season
bump
  for what
