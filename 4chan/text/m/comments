im in the middle of watching aura battler dunbine and i know that theres an ova something about shou being reincarnated and garzeys wing ive already heard some terrible things about garzeys wing but is it worthwhile to watch the ova set 700 years in the future
no theyre beyond garbage
  nah
    okay thanks anons now i can just focus on finding a new show to watch instead
  both are truly horrible the ova is like shitty late 80s schlock trash but not even trashy or dumb enough to enjoy wings of rean has some cool ideas but feels like a halffinished piece tomino shat out due to his bipolar selfloathing sensibilities
  i wouldnt even call it an ova the aura battlers are literally barely animated like seriously theyre still frames in almost every scene zwauth moves its arm a little in one shot that take place in the dark so that they dont have to draw any details complete shit
  garzeys wing is fucking kino and a great pleb filter from based tomino
did anyone ever rip the fixed subs from that recent bluray release that shit is far too expensive for me to import and the old subs suck
im watching this show for the first time im only on episode 15 but by god this show is slow greco had the problem of not having enough episodes this is the exact opposite issue
  maybe stick to idolmaster then you fag
  nothing of real significane happens in the first 10 episodes after show defects its not quite motw but the episodes in hindsight almost feels like filler
  i fucking love the tv series but garzeys wing is absolute rubbish no joke no idea about the other ovas
hjiacking this real quick is there a good torrent of dunbine anywhere did it ever get a blu ray release
    garzeys wing has a bombass dub though check it out if you want a good laugh otherwise its not tominos best work     tale of neo byston well is disappointing allaround i always think of the line from cromartie high when i think about it some anime theres hardly any movement
  theres a bd release on nyaa i didnt bother getting it because honestly the dvd release looks fine
  yes it got a gorgeous bd release in japan and in na the na release actually fixed the subs but the only rips online are the japanese release with the old dodgy dvd subs
  the ovas are dogshit the only one remotely decent is wings of rean but thats not very good either
so just how bad are the old subs im downloading the series now but if theyre real bad ill wait until i can afford the bd
  shou is called show zama and cham is called chum
  did i manage to find a version with the good subs then the names seem correct so far
  cham is correct for like the first half but then they change it midway or something im using w_d subs and im not sure if theyre the ones that everyone is talking about when they say shit subs but theyre still shit subs so i just sort of assumed
  the subs are mostly fine until the second half
  considering srwx used them i wonder if those are official
are the old subs actually bad or do they just have weird romanizations because doramuros a better name than drumlo for the tactical ladybug robit
  yeah and bubbly is a better name than bubuly
  the old subs are all over the place dunbine was a passion project form carl macek who went and changed the names so that they accurately reflected the celtic myths that were their inspiration the problem was they were this weird deromanizing of names that were already translated weirdly into japanese in the original and they couldnt keep the new versions or the originals straight half the time    not to mention by the second half adv stopped giving a shit because sales for the show were abysmal so any kind of quality control or editing went out the window thankfully the new english bds fix both those issues
  yeah they try to break into the castle to rescue the princess like 5 episodes in a row despite feeling like filler i still enjoyed them
  also watching it for the first time and that was probably the only unbearable part of the earlier episodes afterwards despite every episode featuring some form of attacked by todd/garalia/bern i felt that every episode moved the plot forward in some way and really wasnt filler
  hmm thats unfortunate if i ever do a rewatch ill try and track down the new set thanks
  theyre passable but theyre wildly inconsistent with naming names would change from episode to episode and shit
im only about halfway through but am i correct in saying that cham is best girl
  yes no sane person would dispute this
shot weapon becoming some spooky cosmic horror character in the ova was fucking stupid
  show is a perfectly valid translation its how show hayamis name is written in english
why did they change the billbines colour scheme for the last few episodes i really liked the red and white design
quick rundown on what improvements the bd set made to the subs  
  the aura battlers are literally barely animated like seriously theyre still frames in almost every scene  there are less than 30 fucking seconds in the entire thing where theyre actually animated rather than being still frames shifted across the screen    no joke this is nearly all of it right here really disappointing after having seen the galient ova which at least had one good fight scene at the end
  that two frame animation of the sword being swung  im almost impressed at least the stills are pretty until they start sliding around
has anyone ripped the new subs yet
  no i would say buy it and do it yourself but you missed it on sale for 20
  she is best girl but marvel is pretty great too
  its how show hayamis name is written in english  thats not a translation he or his agent or whatever decided to style it like that because he thought it looked cool and probably didnt even know its an english word  his name is 奨  しょう  shou or shō if you like to use that stupid overline thing
  i really was hoping for something like this out of the dunbine ova  
  i would honestly love a cel of this just because the actual drawings are gorgeous even if they are just being slid across the screen or zoomed in and out on most of the time im fine with limited animation techniques but that seems a bit excessive for a mecha ova even in that clip which apparently has the most full animation
  the tv show had some pretty nice cuts all over the place as well kind of sad that takahashis two best animated shows were canceled
  a word can be a name like chuck or brick or red or grace or phoenix i can keep going
i honestly enjoyed more all the ovas than the main thing  as self contained stories and much shorter ones at that things arent as boring and slow    lets not kid aura battler dunbine is a very old dated show that simply does not hold well    the ovas are often gorgeous to behold  even if theres that ova where the battlers are pretty much not animated its still really pretty to look at them  all the details are beautiful    i also found interesting that the world s society pretty much regressed in most aspects compared to dunbine  theres also the fact that it depicted pieces of the modern world seemingly having been transported in at random that sounds like a very interesting concept
  brick isnt a name
  that stupid overline thing  and were supposed to take your point seriously
  if youre telling me you liked garzeys wing more than dunbine youre a liar i might even believe you about wings of rean but not motherfucking garzeys wing
  fuck you slag
  there is no such thing as a show being dated dunbine is excellent
  fucking peasant just buy it i did
  dunbine does have some serious pacing issues then again what tomino show doesnt
  its stupid and pointless change my mind
  overman king gainar
  i got like 12 episodes deep i love the visuals but holy shit the main character is annoying
  uhhhh hes the second most likeable main char in all tomino shows first being the g reco kid
  i had no issue with the pacing at all i was engaged all the way through i would point to ideon and lgaim for examples of pacing issues personally for meandering too much or pretty much all of his post turn a stuff for rushing way too much
  i think dunbine sags in the middle like most full length mecha shows    especially when theyre back on earth
  no one has uploaded these blurays yet  someone uploaded and retimed subs for the dunbine ovas blurays  its not fair
what did she mean by this
are the old dunbine dvds still 300
  theres a listing on ebay for both adv box sets for a total of 250 so its slightly cheaper than it used to be considering the bds were on sale for 20 during black friday though
  this is the insane opinion the broken mind opinion
  i certainly enjoyed the visuals much more than dunbine thats for sure    also i was more interested in the setting than the mechas   the the way the society was depicted tickled my buttons    as for dunbine toward the last 10 episodes or so i realized i had completely stopped caring about what happened to the characters    i got bored
  good fucking god eurox is always fucking amazing and god i wish we had bds of thatmight buy it for for christmas as a present for myself
  if you do please upload them
what what his end game
  hymen or the dork standing behind him
  stare at old man ass maybe    aint gonna judge another mans hobbies
  the jam dude
  oh after he got total control he was going to force everyone off earth and explore space
  subverting his host nation
  create a true chekist society
  to jew earth out of its gold
titans  complete victory    the titans led by jamitov hymen won the battle and put an end to the era of constant warfare    jamitov who dismantled the corrupt earth federation government and gained tremendous power begins to act toward his true purpose    earth revitalization plan    a new human management system that involves forced relocation of the earths inhabitants    for the titans this is an act of betrayal and loyalty to jamitov is greatly strained    however jamitov succeeded in minimizing dissent by thoroughly pursuing opposition forces    as such human beings disappear from the earth    under this strict management system efforts to revitalize the earths environment are promoted    the souls of those who were pulled down by gravity have been set free    mankind who entered the vast frontier of the universe was about to enter a new era of evolution
  posting that fanfic still
  what are you gonna do about it cuccboi
  his plan was noble fucking stoping tardnoids from starting wars and dropping colonies onto the earth
  its what scirocco says in episode 21 or 22jamitov is actually running a massive false flag operation he despises the ruling class of earth presumably for their corruption and wants to remove them from power he plans on doing this by concentrating political and military authority into his hands using the whole antispacenoid secret police thing and wartime emergency powers as the cover story until he has a good enough position to be able to overthrow the eff       implying its fanfiction    thats the ending you get in gihrens greed if you still have scirocco and your alignment is high if your alignment is low or you dont have scirocco what happens instead is basque exposes jamitovs subversive agenda and has him arrested and executed basque then leads the titans in a genocide against all spacenoids
  basque then leads the titans in a genocide against all spacenoids
  jamitov you son of a bitch
  you know what would be neat a scenario where this led to a successful uprising against the titans neo gryps conflict would be awesome
  what the fuck is the guy besides jamitov wearing
  so wed end up with the titans trying to force everybody into space and what zeon trying to force everybody to stay on earth thatd be funny
  uniform
what if theres new zeon ms being made around victory or gaia gear 
     new zeon ms   its just reskins of old zeon ms
  i quite like the idea of this except for the dom its just a dom with devil gundam legs
  gelgoog having a huge bulge    is this supposed to symbolise something
  thiccc don is best dom
  i love it except for dom   how the fuck does it move      norsehound always liked his ships   his work may not be beautiful but his ideas are rock solid simple clean work
  how the fuck does it move  do i need to tell you it hovers genius
  i know that but i cant shake the feeling it will split at any moment  it looks like someone tried to weld a dump truck to the tips of two soyuz rockets
    what if theres new zeon ms being made around victory
  nigga the zaku 50 is an anaheim invention intended to cash in on nostalgia    except they were on lsd when they designed it so besides the head its just a mobile armor
  looks as if the gouf and gelgoog had sons with a power loader
  i mean who wouldnt want to fuck it
  neo zeong phase 2
  only good one is the gyan and its just the gyan ex slightly tweaked
  tfw imagining a gelgoog jager with that gelgoogs build   fucking hell i need this
the only gundam i can still enjoy as an adult
  yeah i made that thread too
whats /m/ opinion on the mecha from the titanfall series  you gotta take in consideration that their design is a lot more western than eastern due to the company that created it being well western
  theyre not /m/ the devs said so themselves
  /m/  stop that
  titanfall 2 didnt deserve what happened to it that was a textbook example of how to turn a franchise around they literally had the writers watch gargantia as reference for writing bt
  to this day i still like the titan and the imc its the only western mecha i like
  the only thing wrong about it was its published by ea which are extremely notorious for cannibalizing any series regardless of quality needless to say ea killed it but how they did it was as though they tried burying it to acquire respawn later which the act itself was scummy    as for the actual game i kinda wished they give the same treatment to the titans themselves as they did to the pilots even then they were great to pilot even if they can last for less than a couple of seconds depending on how fucked its deployment was
  i remember i once deployed a titan right next to one of those miniguner titans and my titan died so quick i couldnt even eject  good times
its not a mecha series its creators said its not a mecha series besides its a dead series anyway and we wont be seeing more of it stop posting this trash in /m/
the first game was utterly brilliant multiplayer with a shit excuse for a campaign they then gave us one of the best singleplayer campaigns in recent history but fucked the multiplayer irrevocably cant win i guess
  robots being bros
i like the thick ones  not a fan of the spindly ones    only played the second game it was good rip to the franchise tho
  still playing it from time to time on my ps4 good game
  ronin best boy
  sleeker looking votoms
  i like them there should be more shootan games with giant buddy robots
    2 giving us best boy bt more than makes up for that one time the devs were asshats
  not /m/
itt retarded questions that dont deserve a thread  why the fuck didnt feddies build underwater cities they have the technology for literally hundreds of space colonies they should at least have a few dozen underwater cities think of the benefits  no land mass to colony drop  actual colony drops are impeded by miles of water  the federation navy has an actual role now
   colony drops are impeded by miles of water    id have figured a colony drop would result in the kind of typhooninducing event that youd not want to be in the water for    i need a physicist
why is there constant east vs west shitposting
why does chronicle asher use his mask
  because zeon has a fuckton of aquabased mobile suits
  why the fuck didnt feddies build underwater cities  they have too much unused land that building an underwater city would just be an enormous contest of pointless economic and engineering dickwaving besides this is the federation were talking about they are perpetually stuck in bureaucracy and dealing with welfare issues at least the space colony construction and relocation program had the purpose of moving the socially and economically poor away from the elite and reducing the ecological footprint of humanity on earth    youre in luck though an underwater city shows up in victory gundam episode 33 or thereabouts unfortunately theyre not federationaligned at least unofficially the people in power were zanscaresympathizers and very much married to the matriarch cult of zanscares queen maria i think        depends where in the water you are usually tidal waves are only a problem for shorelines we dont hear about the ocean floor being scrubbed clean by earthquakes tidal waves
    the problem is that water is an incompressible fluid for all practical purposes and to an underwater city the pressure wave from the impact would be like the mother of all depth charges
  i doubt theyll survive an onslight of zeek attacks since zeon seemed to have the better aqua ms basically making them even more sitting ducks that they already were with the many many dangers of fighting in a colony or near the damn thing well thats what i think at least
   colony drops are impeded by miles of water  yes but the colony is still going to slowly hit the city anon its not going to stay a float
  engineering for the deep sea is actually a bigger challenge than engineering for space high pressure is a bitch to deal with
  there iswhere do you think the (((jupiternoids))) are hiding 
  furthermore what benefit do you truly gain from building underwater cities instead of say floating cities if your main concern is overpopulation the idea that feddie engineers would spend that kind of resources wmdproofing their dwellings when its only seriously ever happened once is absurd
  when its only seriously happened once   three times but its still a dumb idea yea
  looks cool geothermal stuff too maybe i dunno downside is seismics possibly    also a floating city needs to still anchor itself to something unless you want to really entertain the idea of a free floating aquapolis taking the tides or some shit
  a lot of it in the past few months may well literally be one guy  otherwise though no answer to why it exists in the first place theres a lot of potential for discussion though such as the prevalence of the false east v west dichotomy stereotypes and ignorance company/console war idiocy being carried over etc      according to him inshow its because of the dust and smell of earths atmosphere or something to that effect but i may be misremembering
   retarded questions that dont deserve a thread  ok what if the earth federation gave the colonies full independence what would happen
  according to hasegawa the earthsphere orbital areas gets divided up between warlords
what was so bad about megazone 23 part iii
  this image every colony turning into something like cosmo babylonia it would be 40k but worsts
  except everything is fucking goofy looking and the gundams have anchors on their heads
how big was the sleeves they seemed like they had more forces than chars neo zeon
    chars neo zeon chars fleet consists of the flagship rewloola thirteen musakaclass cruisers and about a hundred mobile suits the entire fleet carries 85 suits      in the final section of the story over the rainbow were told that the main tennyson fleet consists of nine musaka cruisers and six camouflaged transport ships similar to the garencieres the nahel argama crew estimate that these ship types carry six and three mobile suits respectively for a grand total of 72 mobile suits  in addition to the tennyson fleet the rewloola also has two musaka cruisers as escorts assuming these ships are fully loaded theyd carry a total of 24 mobile suits that gives us a grand total of one rewloola eleven musaka cruisers six camouflaged transport ships and 96 shipbased mobile suits
how come zeon didnt use orbital bombardment to take out soft eff targets on the ground also why was zeon better at underwater warfare than the feds
why doesnt the crossbone vanguard just straight up kill their prisoners instead they throw them into the gravity well and ronah somehow expects they might survive shes either a psychopath or actually retarded
  what about the palau forces theyre ssleeves too right seemed like there were a few dozen gazas and geara dogas not to mention the handful of musais
  the feds never had a reason to go underwater and minowski particles
  zeons only hope was to land on earth and knock out jaburo to force a victory because even if zeon has the momentum and tech theyre still a much smaller force that is going to have a hard time winning by trying to destroy the entire eff they cant drop another colony because the antarctic treaty game rules says so and apparently no one has thought about dropping an asteroid instead its worth noting that there arent many asteroids around the earthsphere in the first place rocks like luna ii a baoa qu solomon and pezun were towed into place from far away as a result of years of effort and high energy/fuel costs    anyway landing troops on enemy territory means they need to capture resources and secure bases on earth for themselves to use the ef navy was horribly fucked up by the tidal waves generated by the colony fragments impacting earth iirc at least one fragment landed in the pacific ocean i would guess the ef navy was probably less of a priority for the federation to focus on rebuilding so when zeon landed on earth the ef navy wasnt able to resist and zeon was able to secure territory and capture entire bases like california base among the captured bases were coastal submarine bases and land bases housing landships these formerly federation submarines and landships were put into use for zeon    dabude landship was originally a russian/federation design that was captured by zeon      zeon submarines were originally federal models captured by zeon and modified for their uses        from there on the ef navy never had a chance to recover while zeon just kept improving their brand new naval forces that they were able to obtain at the feds expense
  yep those forces are considered sleeves too i would assume that palaus forces were more or less wiped out or surrendered after the nahel argama won their battle there    i guess it wouldnt be wrong to say that the sleeves were larger than chars neo zeon of course a large part of the sleeves happen to be using equipment that used to be from chars nz forces anyway
  how come zeon didnt use orbital bombardment   antarctic treaty and the fact that most high priority targets were underground plus minovsky particles son   why was zeon better at underwater warfare   the return of johnny ridden sort of answered this question but whether thats canon or not is debateable     according to that it essentially boiled down to zeon misreading the federation zeon expected the federation to hold out on earth for the remainder of the war and expected them to make a bigger deal out of the seas so they invested heavily in aqua suits the federation decided to play a different game and cut zeon off from space with operation odessa then decided to bum rush space with the numbers advantage the zeon troops knew this was bad news and thus the hail mary attack on jaburo     thats also why theres so fucking many zeon remanants on earth
  zeon would find some other bullshit reason to pull their nazi shit
  why the fuck didnt feddies build underwater cities    well consider how much we know about space due to how much shit we can launch up there then compare how much we know about the ocean due to how much we can send down there     the same reason we have a space station in orbit right now and only three undersea habitats the deepest only 19m below sea level    pressures a bitch anon you can just fly to space
whos /m/s favorite tomboy law enforcement officer
  theyre all the same fucking character anyway but middle girl from tank police is the cutest so she wins every time
  i forget was right autistic about her bike like the other two were about their tank/mech
  yes
  tomboy are fucking trash
  im sorry you can only handle women with zero personality and guts being autistic must be such a hard life
  have fun fapping to a man with tits also tomboys have had the same personality from fucking day one    im a girl who likes manly stuff xdddd
  better than a personality of i have a vagina 
  have fun fapping to a man with tits  i absolutely will thank you
    
  this thread not ever /m/
    what show is the one on the right
  patlabor without mecha
  youre under arrest certified honorary /m/
    thanks im going to check it out based on this thread
  its fun because theres an actual trap character and hes more feminine than the tomboy
  im not sure if she countstbqh
  leona of course      of course she does although the sac version is the least tomboyish
  obviously noa    t trapfag
  discount leona
  is it wrong i wanna see noa  leona team up to stop a crime wave
  of course not but theyd constantly be at each others throat
      is where you belong
  iirc her partner miyuki was the one who was more the mechanical tismo natsumi was more about guns
  trains are super interesting
im trying to remember the middle ones name but until then noa for me i already know shes from tank police
  noa by far
  i wouldnt call the major a tomboy she seems completely in touch with her feminine side to me
    where you belong
  being a tomboy would require being a woman first
  yes trains
  hitomi kanzaki
  of course she does although the sac version is the least tomboyish  imho not  not totally sure about pic related but better
the best tomboy is a tomboy that can do a mama without fear of losing tomboy status
unless you say thats not tomboy thats a dyke in which case ok
is righteous bounty hunting law enforcement
  i just want an excuse to drop my motokos ffs
   dont know much about trains but thats quite a caboose
  motoko is a lipstick lady so not really tomboy even though she is all pro action and cyborg muscle  i think shirows most tomboylooking woman is the inspector that had no part in dominion conflict
although the clothes could be misleading its possible she might also be a ladytype still
    that chick also wears lipstick by your dumb standard she aint a tomboy either    motoko is just as much of a tomboy as kei
  not if you compare her to deunan
  her mouth is not visible enough the drawing could represent a woman that dresses kinda like a man and doesnt wear make up as well as a motokotype woman that just happens to have her hair look like this in that panel    we shall never know because more dominion never  rarrrrgh
  her mouth is visible enough shes clearly wearing lipstick
  theres tank swat 01    its meh and looks awful
  belongs in the board with threads dedicated to milfs tomboys monstergirls and robot girls    uh ok
  doesnt like tomboys  calls others gay  
    mah bead flicking nigga
  read that as bean flicking
no one posted sybel from black magic m66
  thats because shes a reporter not a law enforcer
  that a cut boy you posted anon
  no way its just an outline drawn with the same thickness as her face contour so completely inconclusive
  cute boyfemale
/m/ police thread
  precisely shirow draws lips thinner than the head contour when they dont have lipstick
  natsumi was more about guns    no that was miyuki natsumi is working on her undefeated of the east training and could flip cars and shit shes also dating domons cousin
        you guys i like you guys
  thats not a detailed shot though so thats probably the thinnest/default pen he had and just used for that reason
  shes a lipstickwearing bimbo is what she is
  you are probably just defensive and afraid that she might have better ass than major
  man irias tits are so perfect also bigger
    squishy
    why doesnt anyone bring up the fact that theyre all cops    the late eighties/early nineties saw a boom in cop anime    its weird
leona was probably my first 2d crush so it always feels weird seeing her posted here
    frankly i wish there where more police anime theres what else hyper police for the shinto furry crowd
yuuta is best cop/girl/boy
  they can use lethal force and carry guns but are not stuck in as rigid of a hierarchy as the military which gives them a bit more opportunity for agency as characters
    also there where a lot of cop shows on tv at the time
  sir thats not a tomboy thats a gremlin
  shousa is not a gremlin
  tomboys dont participate in lesbian group sex embracing femininity really doesnt get more blatant and overthetop than that
  its small  its ornery  it hates airplanes  it multiplies if fed after midnight    its a gremlin
  dang that changes everything
kiyone makibi
  it hates airplanes  
  came here to post this
      not a tomboy
    wwii air crews sardonically attributed the results of their challenging maintenance conditions to gremlins sabotaging the airplanes
  yeah but does the toko hate airplanes
    not very familiar with the character are we
  perfectly familiar with the manga version not so much with other versions but we arent dealing with them
  no akane  for shame
  motoko is just as much of a tomboy as kei  what a bs  if you put both in the same dress the difference would be obvious like here
or here
  think again
  it doesnt matter how many times you say it
as i said even nonflash kei isnt a clear case and there is league of difference between her and major
too many distractions from canonical tomboys
oh fuck its a floof thread now
how come everything this guy has done is way more interesting than anything tomino has worked on yet tomino is praised way more
  hes not a weirdo attention whore who talks about wanting to lick anime pussy    he keeps a low profile
because gundam is more mainstream
  because 90 of the shit he works on he takes on chief director credit which is akin to producer meaning it isnt even his work the few works he does direct are complete unapologetic garbage arjuna and his best work is only when he is working with those more competent than him watanabe and ishiguro    as a designer hes been rehashing the vf0 for almost 2 decades and hasnt done anything really new or interesting since armored core    hes old news
  arjuna  garbage  found the conservitard
  because kawamori is a hack in the last 20 years he has not worked on a single good anime
shoulders of giants
  sv262  rehash of anything
  but like you say his armored core stuff is great
  hes a great mecha designer or used to to be at any rate most of his directorial stuff fucking blows though
  he ruined anime by inventing waifufaggotry for selfinserters with dyrl
  as a designer hes been rehashing the vf0 for almost 2 decades    you know he does more than just macross right you would be hard pressed to find any combining mecha that can top the aquarion for sheer mechanical genius of design even if the show it was in was a mess
  aquarion   mechanical genius of design
    it is though     here you have three flying machines with very different designs that combine into one robot where each ship can fill any of the three roles in the transformation to produce different looking mecha with distinct profiles that all look good and it accomplishes this transformation in a way that functions without parts magically morphing or appearing or changing shape its all mechanically viable     thats a tremendous achievement of mecha design and i would be surprised if you could name another transformation or combination that tops it for flexibility and complexity of design without resorting to shortcuts
  the aquarion designs got worse over time logos mecha designs are just garbage
  interesting doesnt mean good nobunaga the fool is an interesting series sure but its also a dumpster fire
  its because he enjoys his work and idols in general he also accepts that you have to sell toys and music to make money for more shows
my job is so /m/ i work in the internet department of a hobby store we sell a lot of gunpla power rangers and zoids    tell me anon how /m/ is your job
    join the navy cause of gundam  picked my orders because it had the word mobile  work with electronics on a base with lots of jets planes and helos  get to operate a giant forklift  get to fly to weird places on a bunch of cool air force and navy planes  in a few years i get to pick orders to a ship    most life descions ive made have been fueled by my love of giant robots started chatting up my wife way back when cause she was arguing with someone about nge she had to stop me from naming our kid noah if a boy or camille if a girl i may be autistic but hell i love my life
i make bearings most of which go into cars i work with a lot of automated manufacturing equipment that could be considered lowerend robots so i suppose my job is somewhat /m/
im a warehouse worker i pick products throw them them on a skid and shove it across the sections of the warehouse to complete the order before dropping it off on the dock its not /m/ in the slightest i use a hand jack as opposed a ride jack 90 of ride jack users use it to compensate for being shit at their job yet are still out pulled every night by dog walkers and im not trained to use either the sit down or stand up lifts
i work in a lingerie store that has a fairly decently sized bit for bondage stuff and sex toys we sell a few different diecast handcuffs and toys so i guess that would technically count as chogokins and sex toys are just a few steps away from sex robots too like theres shit that works from an app on your phone via a wifi connect to work from anywhere in the world give it a voice and its basically a robot right there
  i do general labourer where i imagine how robots will steal my job in the near future
i work with laser cutting/engraving machines is that /m/
  i pilot a giant robot
i used to work with large 4axis robotic arms setting them up in our shop before shipping the whole layout to the customers location was fun work but my god that place was a shitshow
im a janitor
im a radio talk show host in brazil
  anything known fiquei curioso
  machines  lasers  quite /m/ id say
  i am an electrician among other things i have installed welding painting and steel pressing robots at a gm car plant a giant centrifuge for refining radioactive isotopes for malinckrodt motor controls numerous conveyor belt systems and solar arrays
  i help with lockheed martins orion project
  you are the /m/an
  at least can do some /m/ related stuff with those machines
  no no just an online radio my show is about anime tá aqui brother 
  orion project  you work with p3s arent you all getting phased out by boeing i work at a asw command and all but two of our squadrons have transitioned to p8
  not naming your kid loran or laura
  do you have to be autistic to get the job
  camille if a girl
  i work in radio     usually theres a large board with a bunch of buttons and sliders like a 70s hero robot but my current gig is just doing prerecorded stuff so theres not much like that
now this is how you make a proper mazinger sequel none of that shin mazinger trash
call him mazinger  never actually show him mazing
  infinity  cringe
    at least make proper sentences with if youre going to troll
  the best part of infinity is that grendizer no longer exists in the main continuity of toei mazinger
  toeizinger  big ewwie yikes
can i watch this without the old show ive never watched nor read mazinger
  i think the only bad adaptation was skl and only because it was a short ova that had lots of potential but they dropped the ball with it
  yes you can but there are a few references to the 70s show that you might not get
  thats just a toy literally means nothing
  infinity was good but dont shit on shin mazinger that was good too
  fuck that liberal trash promoting illegals and ms13 gang members
      have they made an infinity version of kaiser yet
  riobot mazinkaiser is the closest thing we get
  and yet they still managed to mess up in a way i didnt even think was possible
  white washed  youre not even trying anymore
      looking closer i think shes just covered in shadows because on the the train ride scene in broad daylight with sayaka and shiro near the begining of the movie she wasnt any darker than them    either that or they cant keep her coloration straight    i do need to give the movie another chance though
  how with the exception of part 2 its about giant robots fucking stuff up
    you cant keep whining about this for the rest of your life give it a rest they made her a bit lighter than usual but shes still a different shade than everyone else its not a big deal
  the worst part of infinity is that grendizer no longer exists in the main continuity of toei mazinger  ftfy
  she still looks darker
shes now milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate
  yes
    shes not really noticeably darker than shiro there to the point im not sure if its lighting a tan or im just trying to see her as darker when shes not really if she is darker its incredibly hard to tell in most scenes for what ever reason      im actually calming down to really jus seeing this as a nitpick of mine with the movie im going to give it another chance this afternoon after i ragequitted it last weekpathetic i know if the next mazinger reboot goes back to having a noticeablydark skinned jun ill probably just write this of as a brief moment of stupidity
  go to bed wasim
  nigga at least you got some scenes
  shes darker than shiro in   though not by much but she still is visibly a darker skin tone than shiro     they just cant seem to get the tone down     apropos of nothing whitewashing is mostly a made up tumblr thing and i doubt japan gives a shit
  pretty sure the term existed long before tumblr at the very least shes been lightened up so much its honestly hard to tell whether or not shes actually still supposed to be mixed or just went to tanning salon or its lighting thing im still not actually sure from image they look pretty close if not the same  you can actually make a better case since sayaka does actually look lighter could just be from the fact shes in a dimly blue lit room seriously if the kaiser ovas didnt have any problem with coloring jun toei doesnt really have good excuse    im getting ready to sit down and watch through the movie right now at least ill know what to expecti had heard they darkened her in the movie from the promotional images and the trailer so was a bit disappointed to see that didnt seem the case so ill have some solid non jun related thoughts on the movie in about two hours
  but shin wasnt a sequel
are all subs for this terrible both the english sub and spanish subs ive seen are just bad
  seething
  thats not true remember duke and his sister maria left earth to go repopulate fleed at the end of the tv series they arent in infinity because theyre literally across the galaxy
ok im big enough to admit where im the jun issue isnt as bad as ive been thinking during the train ride theres this shot and later during the lab i was able to get good looks a her next to sayaka lisa and kouji and she does look darker than them shes also noticeably dark while giving birth and honorable mention the chibi image of on sayakas phone was also dark on the other hand theres scenes that seem try too bscure downplay her darkness like  with shiro the flashback to her and tetsuya in their new apartment and the hospital scene at the end here tetsuya must have sunburn or something so its more like her coloration is inconsistent as fuck still im willing to admit ive overreacted ill shut up now and you all are right    moving on the movie was great wasnt sure about the the segmented armor on the designs but they actually look great in action voice acting was good too i can see why some people think tetsuyas voice actor doesnt do good impression as the original as the other actors try to
  jun and sayaka
  jun and lisa
  jun and kouji
  now this is how you make a proper obvious bait thread none of that high quality bait trash    fixed no need to thank me
its true they lightened jun a lot the movie was decent but i thought the sound mix was pretty bad while watching it in theaters and theres a lot of dead silence during parts where some lowkey bgm would have helped the mazin girls fanservice was also pretty cringey the plot was also pretty meandering but overall i thought it was a fun movie
  so in summary ive been an over reactionary nuisance sorry
is there a single gundam series for somebody who doesnt give a fuck about tominos dogshit philosophy or opinions on war and adults and just wants to watch robots and spaceships blast each other to pieces
  build divers
  g gundam
  g
thunderbolt
  i think you should check out aldnoah zero gundam is for normies and plebs
  seed destiny
  g
no gundam isnt for you fuck off
  unironically this if you skip the bullshit story and melodrama  hope you like stock footage
  just watch youtube clips of gundam fights
you know which one
  cuckdam virgin seething
i like how that guy in 08th ms team changes his worldview every 5 minutes  i want to kill all the zeon  becomes  i want to save all the zeon  becomes  i want to kill some of the zeon or maybe all of them or maybe none of them i dunno im scared
g gundam build series
  ibo is the gundam for retards
  greco
  gsaviour
  must be your favorite anime then
  just buy one of the dynasty warriors gundam games
  g is all about environmentalism and manly drama and love though      just go watch md geist or dangaioh or something
  build fighters try replaces the boring war is bad muh tragedy bullshit with great action top tier mecha design a smart confident mc and hot girls who are like a faucet at the mere thought of him paying any attention to them its the chadest of all gundam series
  no watch 80s ovas it is the only choice for true mecha fans
    when you gaze long into the abyss
        have you fags actually watched g this is almost insulting to the director yasuhiro imagawa     g is a more thematically complex work than any of au gundam with a strong anti war message build fighters is simple shit compared to g
  midget suits are still shit though compared to true ms
midgets shit all over true ms make of it what you will
  and today you can fit a million times more processing power in your pocket than you could fit in a warehouse 60 years ago
  seriously  the animations of late uc shows havent properly shown the actual speed of the suits like f91 and v2 it just doesnt feel fast enough    in games like gundam vs and the psp games they moves pretty much like dragon ball fights during cell arc
  by the time v2 roles around the javelin is nearly obselete getting muscled and outmanouvered by bespa suits and that same mobile suit moves about this fast
  fuck it im posting it again
  funnels cant even hit it    see this op miniature suitsnt bullshit
  what am i watching
  mca doesnt dictate accelleration the javelin is much newer than the f91 and has the higher reactor output and thrust counterbalanced by its unstable vernier placement for similar reasons the f91 production can pivot much faster than the javelin but the javelin wins out when accellerating at odds with its current velocity such as reversing not that any of this is seen in animation though  im an unhealthy javelin otaku      an f91 dancing around 2 quebleys
  i deleted my post because my crap reading comprehension assumed you were referring to the v2 thats pretty interesting howd the javelins eventually lose out to the waspies then
  well federation complacence meant pilots didnt have much idea how to use what they already had combine that with the growing performance and prepardness margin posessed by zanscare and you have the jobbing in victory not that they werent a threat since a properly equipped javelin could eat through whatever defenses a suit had given long enough beam rotors cant save you from an mssized ke penetrator    or at least thats my current understanding
  since this is late uc thread did the ms from victory era has different compact reactor in it theres the episode where 1 mobile suit that got the reactor destroyed blown up like nuke destroying everything
  what game is that
     midget suits from the late ucs are way better than any psychoframe bullshit    at being platforms for combat definitely because the average pilot can be taught to utilize most of their power 100 of the time without issue and they out perform psycoframe equipped units in a straight fight 999 of the time    the issue is that 01 of the time thise psycoframe units will be used by specific people in really specific contexts that make them almost infinitely more powerful    which you prefer is kind of subjective but the guarantee of performance and ease of training mean the military would almost certainly choose the mini mobile suits every time regardless of howucg better the psycoframe stuff could potentially be really really occasionally
  they did but i dont know what the differences are need to break out vmsv to learn more      gundam battle universe for the psp
  ayyyy so ive read none of the other posts in this thread ive come to the conclusion that the feds finally after decades soundly defeated zeon that they lowkey buried anything pertaining to newtypes since they failed to consistently harness nt abilities therefore i believe that lateuc pilots relied on pure oldtype skill and these skills demanded technological requirements far from the ntfocused miduc developments
  i would love this game more if the cut ins didnt cover half the screen
  not necessarily im sure newtypes would appreciate the insane thrust beam defenses enhanced manouverability miniaturization etc that surfaced during late uc newtypes dont just harness mind tech their reflexes are insane and better fundamental ms function goes much further for a newtype than an oldtype as a result its like difference in reflex speed exhibited by a child vs an adult whose mylenation is mostly dead      its unfortunate and pervades the game industry like a plague but youll get used to it
  whats that couldnt hear you from your fat head flying off like a football
  i agree with you but the timetravel shenanigans from uc and now maybe nt make me believe that nts are far beyond what conventional engineers would be able to come up with i dont doubt that nts would have a problem with the conventional advances in ms development but if they had a say in the matter they would overwhelmingly prefer more rd on the psychoframe front than say miniaturization or increased thruster output
  how do they go from the xi/penelope to f91 seems crazy considering how fuck hueg were those two
  i dont doubt that nts would have a problem with the conventional advances in ms development but if they had a say in the matter they would overwhelmingly prefer more rd on the psychoframe front than say miniaturization or increased thruster output  well that depends if the character is a magic wielder who relies on crits or if theyre running an agility/dexterity build    used to be that dumping nearly all of your points into luck was viable too
  different contractor different priorities
  scale literally everything minus white base bravo
  you manlets only exist cause bandai wanted to make smaller and cheaper figures in the same scale and you know it
    why not  midget suit with psychoframe  you guys act like theyre mutually exclusive
  mechlets
  bandai wanted to make smaller and cheaper figures in the same scale and you know it  made hugeass victories that much larger and expensive than old hgs    some 4d chess right here
  the gundams from the special stages in battle universe are scary fast
  this needs an hg revive so bad
  t second choice
  i wouldnt really say they lost out that badly the federation didnt mobilize at all during most of the zanscare invasion when they finally did javelins did admirably well as the gm equivalent of the era they were outdated compared to the wheeled suits but still pivotal to the success of the war
  they were outdated compared to the wheeled suits  i dont care what sunrise says i can never take those things seriously
  why do you think victory barely ever appears in anything
  i dont know its just jarring to me human body can only handle so much acceleration dragon ball mech fights are kinda cringy to me outside of intentially goofy stuff like g gundam    anyway nu is the best gundam design of all time so op is full of shit anyway
id love to see some minisuits like the size of the junker suit used in zz but heavily modified for intercity fighting having mini mobile suits that are like 12 feet tall drifting through the city and getting into gun battles seems fun
i like it
when youre best gear is just a gimped version of the previous mains
  need to see the ver ka mg
  passable at best need to see it in action not impressed
  so the cpacks is actually just psychoframe test unit that was later adopted when developing the unicorn      huh i thought this thing was supposed to be an inbetween that led to the nu gundam      even in the apacks manual they have actually removed everything about the nu gundam and its now full of development references to the unicorn gundam    in fact originally the official website said it was a prototype nu gundam but thats been removed and now it is only a multipurpose test mobile suit that happened to have tested some things that were later used in the nu gundam as opposed to it being direct development    this suit is now somehow a precursor to the unicorn gundam
  overly designed clusterfuck    brb fapping to nu
  huh i thought this thing was supposed to be an inbetween that led to the nu gundam  at most that just means they have a similar frame the narrative was also meant to be able to test a whole lot of different shit so it just has the ability to have a lot of different shit installed    this suit is now somehow a precursor to the unicorn gundam  yes just indirectly in the same way one could say the gundam mark ii led to the zz gundam
so its covered in hot plates
  uc red astray
  ruined a perfectly fine looking suit
actually covered in gunpla 3mm holes
those are some weak looking arms
    adding all of that new armor and leaving upper arms unarmored    other than that it looks really nice
a gundam series with the premise of pentagon wars would be pretty cool
but the bradley works fine
  lol i just started watching this again after last seeing it in the 90s good idea op
  t big bradley  the m113a3 gavin worked fine and is more than a suitable platform for upgrades to fulfill every combat role
  know any other movies like that which focus on the bureaucratic nature of the military
  what are you saying that the kampfer doesnt have enough armor to tank 22lr shots
  i was thinking it would be better from the federation perspective
  maybe zero motivation
  sure ill chalk it down
kelsey grammer in a titans/feddie uniform
  well you see the idea of the project started as a close quarter combat unit but because the brass also wanted it to be pretty fast we ended needing to strip from it most of its armor so to increase its speed output the end result is an unit specialized in close quarter combat which is also incredibly vulnerable at close range   but hey we gave it a shotgun
  air america kinda  hbo did some good original films in the 90s try supergun and by dawns early light
  lol
  focus on the bureaucratic nature of the military  how about a manga about it
  sauce
  taihou to stamp or guns and stamps
  dat kamaz launcher
  fuck that give me a gag series with an ftroop premise of federation and zeon forces saying fuck the war and just having a truce full of shenanigans
  
  it got so offtrack they accidentally made an ifv
i feel like too many people miss the point of this movie and go fucking idiots thinking the bradley is bad because the movie said so no the bradley itself isnt the problem the problem is the corruption in the rd industry
honestly you could focus on any of the feds attempts to make an mp gundam unit since they all went the same way fuck it do it on the zeta series
  but fucking idiots do think the bradley is bad because the movie said so
any good /m/related games on steam you know of most of the good ones arent under the actual mech tag i have been playing the hell outta zeroranger the games whole look is ripped straight outta nge but in all the right ways gameplay soundtrack and mech design is all on point
download mame or fba and play all the cult classics like dogyuun rezeon and batrider
  rezeon  blazeon that is
gigantic army all day every day
metal wolf chaos soontm
  honestly i didnt play it yet but there is war tech fighter that looks at least decent
  battletech  into the breach  strike suit zero  brigador  orbital gear
  oh and zone of the enders 2 just got ported a few months ago if you havent played it yet
  supercharged robot vulkaiser
intrusion 2  the talos principle
slave zero is fun
astebreed  project nimbus
  fuck yeah brigador i really wish that game got more attention _
  isnt it just a shitty cockpit view thing
      seconding these two add armed seven to those recommendations as its also pretty tight would have absolutely loved steel strider if it played like gigantic army but better as opposed to playing like gigantic army but different     sadly i dont know if astro port still has their mojo as their most recent release rocketron which is also pretty /m/ by the way doesnt play so great
  seconding into the breach the rng sucks but its a surprisingly decent tactics game despite how tiny the maps are
  supcom and earth 2150  theres also a good chunk of mech games on gog and abandonware websites like shattered steel and metal fatigue
  no thats just the vr view otherwise its the whole game unaltered save for higher res textures if im not mistaken
wtf no one recommending strania that game is an ode to mecha series and one of the best shmups on steam  steam page    trailer        also their other game on steam the mech fighting game/shmup hybrid senko no ronde 2 is fucking awesome  steam page    trailer        sux that gunhound ex was taken out from steam that game was great
is templar battleforce any good
into the breach is the best mecha release this year because of the absurd customizations you can end up with  how many games can give you a jet that can rocket punch
  oh i got both of those    strania and senko no ronde for 360 senko no ronde 2 for ps4
    whats senko no ronde a 1vs1 arena game or a schmup looks quite cool
  a 1vs1 arena game or a schmup  yes
  boarder down
  versus shmup you shoot bullet patterns at the other player and try to dodge theirs  online is dead but theres a decent arcade mode
not steam but ppsspp runs well even on potato computers so if you have a usb controller you can play the armored core portable titles
thanks to narrative we now know that with psychoframe a newtype could warp time and possibly space too in retrospect do you think it put the axis shock under a new light when amuro pushed back axis did he simply create a huge amount of force or did he twist the fabrics of reality to do that
im so fucking done with uc
  at the time i think it was merely intended to be a huge amount of force sort of like telekinesis but given what unicorn and narrative gave us like it or not im inclined to think its pretty much reality warping at this point amuro gave the laws of physics the middle finger and warped them so that axis just magically got pushed away or maybe its time was turned backwards so it moved back to its original position when it was first formed
  iirc it was stated that amuro created the minovskycraft effect unto axis hence why axis seemingly floated away from earth
    i always assumed that its was just the same space magic from zeta because tomino wrote himself into a corner and needed a bullshit deus ex machina plot device
  first formed  twilight axis its still seen as canon mind you puts a damper on that idea stuff is still there but putting it back before the engines fired would make sense     i always thought it was telekinesis as well the unicorns shields were flying around with no thrusters at all in the final fight and when it blocked the colony laser in addition both it and banshee seemingly just flew with no thursters when they shot off to get mineva
  i now understand the impotent nerd rage of the star wars fans
  i think that nt didnt change the fact that the psychoframe can warp reality through the will of people just added the capacity to manipulate time to a degree
so are amuro char and lalah true newtypes    seems like the t pyschoframe now carries their souls
  first post depressingly best post
looking back at previous works through the lenses of works made by other authors    no
    people have to learn the lesson the hard way hence threads like this
newtypes manipulate minovsky particles somehow its why the phenex can do its forcerays and why mashmyre was able to survive those beams
  unicorn and its spawn retroactively ruin the old uc works  woah who knew
  gundams real robot roots have been retroactively ruined    how to recognize someone who only read tvtropes articles
  banager and full frontal already knew this   narrative looks fucking amazing tho i cant wait     owners of intellectual property cant hire who they want to do what that want with it   no
  nigger did i say anything about muh real robots they retroactively destroy most of the emotional weight of the ending of cca rather than being a vague technology which allows the collective will of all the pilots there combined with one of the series strongest newtypes and most developed characters reaching the peak of his ark the new series recontextualize this in a far more literal and retarded way which lacks all the emotional weight beyond seeing flashy stuff happen
   of intellectual property cant hire who they want to do what that want with it
     they retroactively destroy most of the emotional weight of the ending of cca    not him but ive never understood this mindset chars counterattack still exists the end can still be enjoyed in isolation if you want
  plus axis shock is still arguably seen in awe and wonder inuniverse its a feel good story about mankind coming together and agreeing dumping a space rock on earth isnt worth it even if we hate one another     its just that when unicorn starts erupting into crystals is when things start to get creepy to the world in a low key cosmic horror sort of way and thats what nt is concerned with
  the impact of cca was that it finally killed zeon for good and was the end of an era unicorn and nt raised a corpse to not even do anything worthwhile with it
    wtf are you on about nt and unicorn both hint to what happened to both char and amuro  their physical bodies are gone theyre both true newtypes banagher was also in that state when unicorn became crystal its the same phenomenon with rita     its consistent youre being too sentimental about muh human will when its clear that the energy emanated from the psycoframe      oldsmobile still existed  mars zeon  ovas getting stuck from 00800086    suuure
  char is zeon
     the impact of cca was that it finally killed zeon for good    not really theres still active zeon remnants at the end of the film in the rewloola never mind the government and people of sweetwater
  mars zeon   literally who who never amounted to anything from a manga    oav all set in the past    meanwhile the next real conflict in the uc timeline was 20 years post cca and zeon was nowhere to be seen
    if its dependent on the existence of the next story not including zeon then it didnt kill zeon the next film failing to the nclude them did
  the impact of cca was really seen in the next installment    yes
    no the impact wasnt seen in f91 it was established chars counterattack says nothing about the end of zeon
i think the psychoframe by translating thought into binary that is expressed in action opens the door to god they are tapping into the same power that began the universe thought and will manifested in form do acid and watch unicorn itll make sense
   do acid and watch unicorn itll make sense  t muh realism kid who cant take spiritualism in scifi
  nah i love crazy spiritualism and weird far out magic in my sf weird to me that you interpreted my post as a complaint
time being non linear makes complete sense as the peak of new type abilities if you look at any of the new age movements works you would see that the idea of raising ones consciousness to another dimension would allow people to dr manhattan through time
  oldsmobile were the last shitty whimper of desperate zeon leftovers hiding on mars who saw axis and wanted that kind of power they were eliminated and zeon was never heard from again that was it the absolute last of zeon snuffed out in a couple of volumes leading way to other forces like cosmo babylonia to replace them to compare oldsmobile to shit like the sleeves and their dod machines that can surpass axis shock is absolutely retarded
  i do love the idea that newtypes are basically leering into the force dimensional accessing a non linear form of existence maybe this is why they go crazy so often    makes me wish we could see someone like an alan moore take on gundam who i actually get the impression is an influence on fukui but with more tom clancy and xfiles
  fourth dimension
    even without that time is just another dimension and if youre a 4th dimensional being who can see time it only makes sense that can you travel along it just like we can travel across the three dimensions we can see tesseracts and other higher dimensional theory talk about much the same concepts
  four dimensional geometries dont use time as an axis thats specifically for construction of the manifold known as spacetime an extension of 3 dimensional space along a progression of time    when you get into hypercube shenanigans thats using a fourth axis perpendicular to the x y and z axes
  i always thought it was just a massive burst of energy getting converted into kinetic energy
amuro didnt die his overwhelming power sent him into another dimension where he will battle char for eternity alongside the minovsky emperor
  surprised their arent a shit ton of fanfics where amuro and char end up in other franchises like what happened with halo 3s ending there were some good fics during those years
  stop making shitty uc gundam stories more epic by inserting excellent ken ishikawa plotlines 8
  yes
  using a small amount of barely understood tech the will of humanity saved the earth having more psychoframe exponentially be able to do more weird shit doesnt ruin that
  that was probably the whole reason behind full body psychoframe  if a t shaped handful of pf did that what if we put 100s of thousands times that in an ms and stuck a nt in it
psychoframe fucked up uc now how the fuck is f91 crossbone and victory ever gonna compete against a fucking time warper heck i doubt regild century has anything that could resist being timewarped into non existence
it just seems like a low level feat to show off time manipulation unbuilding shit you can do that with regular telekinesis
  theres the official ones but ones terrible and the other got kind of wonky towards the end though i still liked it
  unbuilding all those reactors at once    which ones
  barely understood tech  who the fuck created something they cant understand and how
    the wright brothers for a start because were not even sure for definite how flight works now after more than a century using planes they certainly understood the practical elements nessecary to build an aeroplane but they didnt understand why it worked and may not have fully grasped why it worked either    the guy who invented vulcanized rubber apparently did so by accident too leaving it to heat on a stove without realizing it all char was probably doing was minituarizing psycommu that it somehow resulted in emergent properties was not likely to be his goal
  yeah pf was meant to remove all the bulky psycommu tech used beforehand even the quebley was using very large systems to make room for more stuff and increase control
     may not have fully grasped how it worked either    i meant how not why which us to say they achieved powered heavier than air flight by experimenting with various plane types so they may not have have realized what was nessecary for it to work
an event meant to show that a collective awakening of human will causes a full realization of a new type awakening and amuro and char finally understand eachother  the end doesnt say much but implies limitless possibility  this sorta gets restated in unicorn but to make late uc a thing it sorta gets shoved aside  also instead of just its new type magic and not science that makes sense its now literal time travel science or whatever    am i the only one who liked newtypes being mystical and under explained    it kinda helped highlight how people were playing with something they barely understood
now if this time warping psychoframe was to be fitted onto the f91 or crossbone f97 imagine the outcome of such outfitting
    well thered be less of it given the disparity in unit size so probably not that great the f91 already has the major constant advantage of increased reaction speed via a different system so itd only get the occasional contextual boost of newtype magic and thered be less material to work with
  unintential effects of pf are what i mean was meant to be smaller psycommu but it became more than that
  unbuilding all those reactors at once  im not saying it would be a low feat of telekenesis its just a weird way to show off time manipulation usually you show off time manipulation with shit that is not physically possible not breaking things down to their base components
  which ones  destiny and 00
    im not honestly convinced it is time manipulation because of shit like that since the wording used in nt is ambiguous and only says something like its as if they were taken back to factory default which could be time manipulation or could just be meant as an indication of how clean and thorough the dismantling of the engines was theres no further indication of time manipulation in nt as far as i know though i could be wrong so it may be uc2 before its really clarified
    neither of those have amuro and char and neither are other franchises for that matter
   youre being too sentimental about muh human will when its clear that the energy emanated from the psycoframe    read the novels faggot its the same thing in all versions of them its the collective human will the collective human will is concentrated into the psychoframes
  its a joke anon
      nothing lasts anons
  i hope this is a woman because i want to fuck this
  its the nu gundam verka
  i realize that my question still stands
  midichlorians
  any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic    this has been explored in an even earlier earlier series with 00
  muh cannon nooovveeels  keep crying tominofag
  were you trying to make an argument just now
  hell yes
  ok then
  its sad you cant make an argument
    its not like those are mutually exclusive scenarios the human will can be read by or collect in the psycoframe and then be released by it as an energy
  are you absolutely sure
  collective human will  most people are oblivious to what is happening  only the people who helped    its easier to reason out char and amuros transformation into true newtypes rather than speaking of the whole of humanity subconsciously wanted axis not to drop
   people are oblivious to what is happening  considering one asteroid has already been dropped causing a massive catastrophe and millions of deaths im somehow doubtful about that    its easier to reason out char and amuros transformation into true newtypes  1 what the hell is a true newtype  2 why would they magically transform into true newtypes all of a sudden  3 where does the assumption that one or two true newtypes would have that sort of power come from    i dont know to me the idea of collective will to live of humanity resonating with the two psycoframes creating a miracle is easier to accept than amuro becoming a literal god for the plots convenience
  can see the giant rock in the sky  char just dropped a rock on lasha  cant put one and one together  its easier to reason you are dumber than the average person in uc
  one person / the will of humanity    neo zeon still has supporters    durrr huurr ignore unicorn and narrative
cuz ideon bro 
  considering one asteroid has already been dropped causing a massive catastrophe and millions of deaths im somehow doubtful about that    the narrative of the film disagrees with you because the end shows multiple people going about their lives as normal just as the rock is being pushed away
  the other narrative of the film where people are jam packed in the streets trying to get to a spaceport to board shuttles to the colonies disagrees with you some are even shooting and blowing each other up in the chaos    besides people wouldnt have been able to ascertain whether the asteroid is traveling away from them or toward them that easily especially not that old lady who looked at it for three seconds in fact all they know is that there wasnt an asteroid in the sky there earlier and now there is until its gone from their sight theyre going to assume its coming closer not going away for all you know these are people who gave up and are accepting their assumed fate
  what about the scenes with mirai where we see overcrowded space ports where people are trying to get off the planet but cannot    the only people who id understand are not aware of whats going on are some bums living in some primitive villages with no access to any form of information those still exist in uc as i understand     everyone with an access to any form of news should be well aware of whats happening   maybe theyve accepted they cannot do anything about it and theyre just trying to act normal   maybe the propaganda has assured them that everythings under control  therere multiple answers your argument isnt very strong
  accepting their fate / something that generates willpower
  except any of these actions do not lead to   the collective human will stops axis from falling
  all they needed were a dozen people next to axis to wish it away look at this idiot who hasnt realized that collective doesnt exclusively mean entire human race
  accepting you cannot do anything about a ginormous space rock thats about to crush you  having no will to live  the mother of all strawmans
  kek already moving goalposts
  which is why people are evacuating
  says the person who wants to use semantics to change the argument    but he said collective and thats wrong
  yes but not everyone was able to   and even those who did evacuate probably arent okay with char destroying their homes and genociding families theyve left behind
  every semantic used to deny the notion that char and amuro transcend their humanity    kek realismfags
  char and amuro transcend their humanity  refer to
  still wont accept narrative and unicorns canonical explanation of the phenomenon  being a realismfag
  realismfags  will of humanity in resonance with magical space t pushing the axis away   realistic
   cannot accept the simple concept of transhumanism  will do anything to discredit that those who were in direct contact with the psycoframe created the miracle by transcending humanity
  this has nothing to do with what i said you fucker
  unicorn will never be canon no matter how much you cry about it
  no no no you dont get to change what were arguing about so easily we are fucking talking about cca and what narratives explanation adds
oh god if psychoframe can time travel imagine how fucked reguild century would be if someone who actually knew what psychoframe could really do was unleashed on that time period along with the unicorn
  i dont know what nt adds as i did not watch it   nor whatever elements unicorn retroactively added to the lore 20 years later  its 100 clear both from the movie and from tominos novels that in in cca in 1988 it was the will of humanity pushing the axis away not charmuro becoming a time traveling transhuman meme
  amuro and char have psycoframeequipped suits  the same material that willed a shield that tanked a colony laser  twilight axis confirms chars body is not inside the sazabis cockpit   unicorn establishes that god unicorn is only possible if the pilot becomes a true newtype god unicorn stops happening as soon as banagher regains conciousness     rita exhibits powers that transcend what the machine specs have because she transcends her physical body and thus a true newtype
  then you just offed your argument by being biased against the established explanation
  you mean the same original novel that had an unborn embryo save humanity from axis
rita had australiad the psychoframe so much that her physical body had to be shed just to let the psychoframe catch a break from her inherent epicness
  its 100 clear both from the movie and from tominos novels that in in cca in 1988 it was the will of humanity pushing the axis away not charmuro becoming a time traveling transhuman meme  thats fine you just need to amend your understanding so its in line with the established content and isnt headcanon from a now incomplete understanding years ago    human willpower still works with psycoframe as full frontal willed the ecaps and epacs of weapons systems to explode banagher and the crews of two ships willing themselves out of the atmosphere or banagherunicorn handwaving the reactors of enemy machines into reverse time travel the willpower to initiate the psycoframe resonance and psycofields and all that shit is still there its just that in addition to that char and amuro and lalah are now also time traveling transhumans      fuck that noise this is the same thing that black_knight says this shit is so infuriating fucking its not canon if i dont like it babies
  i thought for sure our anniversary series would be about char and amuro flung into some distance time/space
  yes its explicitly the human will to live that causes the axis shock not amuro becoming a space jesus  its clearly supposed to be same for the movie
  well shit the whole concept of beyond is this
  forgot the image
  narrative has the punk guy literally use the psychoshard to throw a huge tank at a ship and they say multiple fucking times that its exerting physical force so no the thing in cca was physical force you stupid cunt
  space jesus  theres where your bias is coming from    and again this screams more muh realism more than ever
  no it wasnt thats a load of bullshit that mahq pulled out of their asses over a fucking decade ago thats been debunked ever since the unicorn novels came out dumbfuck    the psychoframe has nothing to do with minovsky particles and narrative comes out and says this again in the fucking show that it has nothing to do with minovsky particles so stop spreading your retarded shit
  kek that only earthnoid children counts
   event meant to show that a collective awakening of human will causes a full realization of a new type awakening and amuro and char finally understand eachother  thats literally the opposite of what happened char spouts some shit about lalah being his mommy and amuro goes what the fuck and then they both get psychoframed
  weve really reached the point that tominofags have become insufferable as roddenberryfags
  when you become a true newtype you become beyond the time
  in ritas case it was because she was too australian for the psychoframe to handle
  theres where your bias is coming from  how does whether i like it or not affect the points i made    my interpretation is from the perspective of the original film you base yours on the stuff fukui added later on  the stuff that doesnt even necesserily contradict my interpretation    and again this screams more muh realism more than ever  theres nothing realistic about either option are you retarded      dumb fukuifaggots thing their fanfic retcons are canon  see i can post nonarguments too
  nope
how ironic when tominos shit psychoframe and axis shock stuff in cca is being explained by other directors cant tomino himself give us an answer to the axis shock incident and time travel plot hole    also nt states that ghost char is the one they came up with the psycho shard technology the gold ring that emits from the new zeong what the heck ghost char
     for all you know these are people who gave up and are accepting their assumed fate    the only people we ever see panicking are in hong kong we see christine and a friend at a beach relaxing the old lady in bed watching and i think a third scene with a baby being born right at the end despite them having no way to know whether theyre safe or not you can theorize theyve just given up but nothing suggests they are resigned instead of ignorant and those would be different attitudes    the other thing is that its entirely plausible they had no idea axis was being dropped since the people in hong kong were panicking because of luna iis fall not axis theres no scene announcing axis is going to fall to the general public and the federation have no reason to do so since they believe char wants axis to found a nation using it        not him but that statement is ironic seeing as how it very obviously is and nothing you say will change that sunrise and bandai own gundam they get to decide canon and theyre building multiple stories that rely on unicorn to exist therefore unicorn has to be canon         its 100 clear both from the movie and from tominos novels that in in cca in 1988 it was the will of humanity pushing the axis away    how does char and the crew of the rewloola anguishing over it happening along with multiple shots of ignorant people on earth constitute 100 clear
  unicorn novels   unicorn  novels  calling others dumbfuck  k
  
  says the retard whose source is mahq     fuck off and die
what the fuck happened why are so there so many unicorn apologists all of a sudden
    there arent people have been defending it for years that youre only just now noticing them doesnt mean they didnt exist prior to noticing
unicorn is absolute dogshit and that would be fine it didnt go back and try to change stuff from original tomino creations    you can say whatever you want about the man but he clearly had a vision that sort of pushed through even though he had to make a lot of compromises throughout the years it wasnt always perfect but in the end what he made was mostly good and worthwhile    unicorn on the other hand really does feel like a diaper wetting manchild playing with action figures and youre supposed to believe that whatever inane faggotry he comes up with should be considered just as valid as anything else made in uc
  unicorn novels is cannon now
  you mean cca apologists right
  how ironic when tominos shit psychoframe and axis shock stuff in cca is being explained by other directors   it was a onetime miracle brought about by the gathered will ofhumanity it didnt need anymore explanation than that as something that would never happen again     even the name axis shock is something unicorn made up because it needed to exploit cca to frame its whole lot of nothing
  so what youre saying is the miracle at axis is supposed to be an absolutely irrelevant affair that has no further effect on gundam after all its never brought up ever again
    newtypes are stupid but they used to be a low key acceptable kind of stupid cca broke gundam with its stupid psychoframe bullshit and now since gundam always has to be escalating shit to try and top what it did before we are stuck looking down the barrel of ever more absurd space wizard bullshit for the rest of time     im just waiting for them to reveal that the minovsky particle itself is the power of a single specific newtype ultrawizard whose desire to stop nuclear war created a new law of physics forward and backward in time that exists specifically to inhibit nuclear fusion
  unicorn will never be canon  black knight
  yes uc moved on gundam moved on tomino moved on
     cca broke gundam with its stupid psychoframe bullshit    zeta ended with kamille speaking with the souls of the dead at least one of whom died several episodes previous which implies extra dimensional power he then got those souls to power up his mobile suit thats not particularlylow key
  implies extra dimensional power   to you maybe
  except japan didnt gundam didnt see coordinators innovators etc
    do the souls of dead people interact with you on this plane of existence
    they would have to because you are on this plane of existence
    ah so you see dead people then i take it cause i dont
  i think you need to work on your reading comprehension
  i think you need to improve your shitposting
    either they exist on this plane of existence so that you can interact with the souls of the dead or they dont and you cant that they were on this plane alive doesnt mean they are when dead else you could interact with them its very straight forward
  if he disagrees with me he must be shitposting  sure if it makes you feel better
  tell me about your interactions with protons anon and i mean you as a person since if you cant they certanly cant exist
    that i dont see them daily doesnt mean that a noone can since they can be observed and b that they dont have observable effects on everything around me how often do dead souls affect you anon
  muh realism  it all comes back to this youre literally arguing i cant see newtype ghosts in real life so it doesnt exist in gundam
   if we dont know it exists then it doesnt    wow good to know science has discovered everything to know about the universe
    in response to but chars counterattack pushing a big rock was unrealistic then yeah ill point out that so were earlier entries        we dont have to know the specifics of something to onowbit has an effect or exists we dont know how gravity works that doesnt mean we cant observe its effect
  we dont have to know the specifics of something to onowbit has an effect or exists     doesnt fucking matter your claim is still that nothing can exist in this universe that is outside of our knowledge
  but we can observe the ghosts powering the zeta and also kamille interacting with them but theres also nothing to suggest that it requires the ghosts to be on the same plane of existence they could function like the ide for all we know
  have nothing to do with the psycoframe and axis
ywn be mind raped by a newtype qt  why even live    also haman best girl
  mashy pls stp she was an overreaching frigid bitch
haman is the best gundam grill but god zz was so bad  judau beecha and mondo where just painful characters coulda been a great show with a better main cast
what a kissable face if only she got her way and received chars dick then zeon could be restored to its former glory god damn it casval you had one job
  haman you had one job and that was a hand job and you couldnt even do that without manipulating a child for your own gain like i will later exactly do with quess but this isnt about me this is about a hand job
what was that newtype bullshit that scared haman shitless she literally ran away crying and freaked the fuck out judau was such a jew      the first half of the series was unbearable so far the second half isnt as bad and hopefully the finale is great puru grew on me so far and roux isnt a bad character as well glemy seems like he is going to fuck everything up in the end
haman just needs a man who will treat her right and be her king
rping
most probably judau will be haunted by her nt ghost for the rest of his life  i dont envy him
if it wasnt for judaus rejection she wouldve had owned the feddies
    i doubt it lalah only haunted amuro and char to get them to play nice but theres no such third wheel for haman she also didnt die angry at judau in any way so theres no real reason for her to visit him if anything shed be haunting char to fuck with his plans but lalah probably stops that    haman and lalah ghost cat fights while char sits there drinking whiskey and trying to put off banging nanai
  
  canon /ss/  i cant be the only one whose fetish this is please tell me there are more shows with this
  not that we know of
  iirc the tetsujin anime from the 2ks exactly has a gal mentioning the concept of shotacon
  id be scared too if someone turned their aura into some scary looking shit and i must be much more desensitized to bad characters because while i didnt exactly love zzs first half it was fine and i didnt have a problem watching it same with cca quess and hathaways stuff didnt bother me at all
  projecting thots begone on the astral plane  bless you judau
  lewd
  ywn have a consensual real sex with a newtype qt
    only judau and dozle have pulled this trick  what did they mean by this
  cant haman do the same thing though    doesnt her astral projection bullshit look even more demonic than jewdoughs when she does it on account of how shes the fucking antichrist
  because its short for shotaro complex much like lolicon is short for lolita complex
  his was filled with righteous fury of brotherly love and anger
is zz worth watxhing
  the first half is pretty silly and some people are put off by that but after that i think its more or less as good as 0079 or zeta it also has the best girls
  dozle was cool as fuck and a great character  has to die the way he does  i wish he could have lived somehow and just went on to be a happy man with his wife
  doubt he would accept defeat and live
  context
  why would he want to restore the establishment that assassinated his father
  ask that to haman herself who tried more than once to bring char on her side even if she already knew he was zeon deikuns son
id let haman shit on my chest
  she already knew he was zeon deikuns son    she did
  soon after the dakars speech everyone on earth sphere and axis knew who char aznable really was
  was axis privy to that broadcast or any of the bootleg recordings
  axis already reached the earth sphere when char made the speech of course they knew
    haman seemed to think char was only ever killing the zabis as a power play and that he was just interested in personal power not in revenge its kind of ironic that despite being a newtype she didnt actually understand him at all
  i want to get forced masturbated by her
  haman is young and cynical enough to generally not actually believe in zabi zeon glemys revolt was actually completely justified from an internal standpoint since haman was pursuing a separate agenda using a fake figurehead for authority its more or less a fight between imperial zeon and ecoterrorist zeon except most of the people on both sides believe theyre fighting for the monarchy
i think generally char and haman are pretty similar people theyre just the kind of people whose personalities cant coexist with themselves
  forced masturbated
  lalahhamankamillequess how does char pull so many qt newtype grills
  kamille  grill    delet this
post cannon fodder mecha that youd gladly pilot
  id gladly pilot the construction mazingers working on infinitys excavation site but i dont have a good image of them  here goes my second favorite mass produced super robot
  as much as i hate seed i love the astray
  im not afraid
with walker machines you dont actually have to fight anyone if you dont want to
  i love these little guys
  you will be    you will be
i pledge allegiance to the flag
inb4 zaku ll
cannon fodder  gladly pilot  itt collective suicide
  f    not really a cannon fodder though  it just proven not gundamproof enough
  guy in this if was a veteran and one day away from retirement
  jokes on you im a perfect soldier
  he was also engaged to be married
  he was about to pay off his student debt
      he used to play the piano
    dang too far anon too far
      his first child was going to be born soon
this
  he had colon cancer and the complete cure was made cheap and affordable an hour after his death
  he had just won the lottery and was going to pay for his grandmothers surgery
  he was about to be awarded a series of awards for his services to the earth sphere
  oh yeah arent they private utility machines a lot of the time
  he was about to be put on the boards of habitat for humanity and the spca for lifetime achievement
  i love astrays so much but theyre depicted as garbage in the series lol
  in case no one has told you left to right kira mu and athrun gender swapped
i love my shitbox gundam
  he was going to reveal information that would link the clinton foundation to numerous crimes against humanity the day after
  yep the real risk is fighting with meandering breakers rockmen maybe toran torans looking to steal your shit or even with guys looking to try and screw you just for not fighting but with a little luck or effort it should be entirely possible to just run away or settle down somewhere
  i know still hawt
  saved
  wasnt it only 2 got shot thats hardly fodder
  he was hours away from his stag party his friends were holding
  clintons thing probably gonna be irrelevant years later
    ill have to make a full screen cap when this is archived looking forward to the results
    his wife/fiancée/girlfriend was going to ask him to have a foursome with her twin/triplet sisters  they would agree to anal
  he was excited to watch the recently announced adaptation of crossbone gundam
real life catgirls were announced shortly after his death  sex gynoid maids were announced after his death  he would have won a lottery to have both
  well there arent that many settings where its such a common occurrence to just be able to buy a mech of your own and not have to worry about being attached to some military/mercenary group or fighting for the sake of an old scientist so yeah a walker machine seems like it has the potential to be a chill choice for a mecha to jump into
  this iron coffin
  is anal really an improvement over vaginal
  grimoirel
  i need a kit of this for skeleton mech purposes
  there are many doms but this is the best one to me
still in active service after all these years
i hope its ai is a bro
gihrens greed thread  whats the best ms to use in the gryps conflict
  kind of a vague question anon for which faction as a grunt suit or an ace suit earth or space
  federation grunt suit
  xeku eins bit pricey well worth it
  too bad seed/destiny shit the bed imagine a seed version of gg we could call it azraels avarice  big question too use njc for improving production output or unlocking nukes
    for practicality and price the gm ii is a solid mobile suit for a good majority of the gryps war as the efsf     pros  low money and resource cost  can upgrade the standard gms into them allowing you to modernize your army from the one year war  like most tier 2 units it can use a sub flight unit allowing it to blitz across the globe in numbers  can be upgraded into the gm iii later on while not as strong as the barzam and especially the jeagan it can still take on just about any titan or early axis zeon unit    cons  completely useless against zeon mas like the big zam and the nieu ziel along with being a victim to beam fields  completely out gunned by just about everything outside of the gaza c from the axis faction right off the bat
espionage team steals zaku ll plans  original zaku ll c type plans  during the delaz conflict
    ce appears to be the only other gundam series with enough material to be able to sustain a gihrens greed esc campaign it might be interesting to see what could be changed from the original timeline    what if the archangel arrived in alaska early  what if nicol was not killed in battle with kira  what if the destroy gundam was deployed to neo during the first archangel intervention   what if the destiny was deployed to heine during the first archangel intervention  what if blue cosmos actually destroyed the plants at the end of seed    series covered  mobile suit gundam seed msv  mobile suit gundam seed  azreals earth alliance  patrick zalas zaft  uzumis orb  gundam seed astray  gundam seed x astray  gundam seed destiny astray  gundam seed destiny  djbrils logos  durrandals zaft  lacuss terminal  gundam seed stargazer  gundam seed delta astray
is gihrens greed just a title rip off of nobunagas ambition
  yep and there could even be some new msv for all the parties the spinoffs would even include areas/warzones in the mars sphere and beyond but thatd be weird to handle    i think so
was there an english translation in last few years or all of them still jp only
  japan only    also this game made me hate the psyco gundam
  also this game made me hate the psyco gundam    i take it you are talking about the psycho gundam mark iis that will be hounding you during the start of the axis campaign they are troublesome especially the one piloted by rosamia and possibly sarah but just remember to take advantage of minovsky particles and 12 based shell attacks from your zassas they are annoying enemies but not impossible to kill
is menace of axis v a solid one as in lots of units and cool paths i neglected the psp so im trying to go back and give it some love thought it might be a good game to pick up for that but im not sure between it and shin gihrens greed
  fucking english translation when
  its pretty solid and the one most people have played online and made guides/lps of
  the ones at the start of the axis playthrough are pretty rough but in my case i got frustrated with enemy factions loving the unit and having them keep on popping up in odd places which would slow down all of my momentum as i tended to have armies of largely beam weapon using grunts   especially in land combat as grunts with flight units cant do shit to them    its really solid
  im trying to play as the aeug help me
  youre gonna need to be more specific with what you need help with
  mass produce the nemo and pray
  how do i get zeta i have the mak2s also i cant take jaburo      i plan to do that
  
    you definetly want to step up a 8 to 10 unit defensive force on the spaces between granada and the gate of zedan/side 3 lines so the titans dont instantly rush it    send the majority of your fleet to slam into side 2 and take it over then split your fleets into 3forces     force 1 will head off to invade side 5 id advise having the grey phantom being the head of this fleet with quattro/apolly/roberto as its pilots  force 2 will head off to invade side 6 mostly send your sniper iis and gm cannon iis for this assault and mostly rely on hit and run tactics by sticking to the edge of the map to fall back as needed  force 3 will be sent off to launch assaults on the orbits above earth the more of these you can capture and hold the less resources and forces the titans can send up from the planet    once you have control over sides 5 and 6 send a small fleet to guard the zone between side 5 and zedan then move the grey phantom unit to overtake side 4 while having a small team holding the position for the eventual assault on side 1     note once you complete the rick dias you will have 10 turns until the option to start zetas plotline drag this out as much as possible to boost up your tech levels then activate it at the last moment you will want to rush for two machines in particular    the hyaku shiki and the zeta gundam    the hyaku shiki not only has great stats but can also unlock an incredibly useless mega particle cannon than can push back entire armies with a good escort    the zeta not only for its stats but for keeping the zeta plot going as normal     as for machines to use the gm ii will be your bread and butter for the war the nemo is alright as well but the extra cost for minimal combat boost performance is not really worth it
    tech level will need to be 20  you need to produce the hyaku shiki and the methuss as well then it will be availiable for production    main campaigns by difficulty    axisaeugefsfzeontitans    aeug is a tough campaign to start with given the lack of territory and it has quite a few nasty surprises that crop up as it goes along
  thank you    can i stop reccoa from joining the titans
  you can but that would require intentionally dodging aeug plot which i find to not be a super great idea as youd have to deal with some horseshit events and units
  can i stop reccoa from joining the titans    if the argama was disbanded earlier i dont believe she ever defects outside of outright stopping zetas events though she will always turncoat to the titans    she is not a very good pilot almost everyone on the argama out matches her in terms of abilities
  fuck
will axis zeon attack me
  right after the battle of gryps finishes they will attack you immediately and events will also have them take over africa and odessa
    unfortunately doing the complete events of zeta will mean the deaths of almost everyone on the argama    roberto can be saved but means missing out on getting katz if you disband early  apolly can be saved but means losing char for the rest of the campaign roberto must also be alive for apolly to be saved  emma can be saved as long as you disband before gryps she also will stay with the titans if you chose not to agree to saving kamilles mother  reccoadisband before granadas invasion  henkendisband before gryps   kamilleas long as your alignment is above 750 he will not become braindead if its below 750 but above 250 he will become braindead but zzs plot begins  below 250 you lose kamille and fa forever    faeven if she is saved you will have to let her retire or lose char forever     also keeping the argama mode on will give you access to amuro kai sayla hyato and beltorchika after dakar
  below 250 you lose kamille and fa forever  its 240    i going to do a replay on the aeug      will the titan join the zeeks or will they attack both of us
  will the titan join the zeeks or will they attack both of us    the titans have been destroyed by that point so they will only attack your forces
  tfw she sticks her finger in your ass
  its a strapon
  i found the nemo line to be incredibly useful moreso for the fact that the nemo ii managed to be a solid performer the moment i unlocked it that thing was my bread and butter for most of the rest of the game im pretty sure i barely even touched the gm iii or the jegan by the time they were unlocked they managed to hold their own against geara dogas even into the 0093 era and they have a quick sidegrade to provide fire support its a surprisingly capable suit
want to play this game so badly  cant read moonrunes  seriously debating learning japanese just to play this  feels bad man
  you can read wiki translations that help a bit    there is also a lets play on sufficient velocity that covers most of the relevant information in the game
  learning japanese wont help you at all learn katakana but thats it
federation scenario goes delaz  axis  titans  titans have lower tech than axis  why
  that shit is never worth it just put money on intel till you can see how many units the cpu has in every territory
  because axis appears in 0083 but goes all the way up to zz while titans are only zeta itd be great if they fixed that giving us uc units on a new game but wed need to ever get a new game for that
no new girens greed going all the way up to victory so i can mass produce javelins   fuck everything
  lel comedy gold
new game with multiplayer when
  gotta know what the katakana means though  having a bunch of syllables is an improvement over a bunch of moonrunes but it doesnt exactly help you figure out whats going on
  you have to start thinking like a weeb and talking in engrish so you can associate the katakana with what it might be referring to
  wait gihrens greed is entirely in katakana butchered english
how do you gentle/m/en generally build your armies    do you rely on building large and well maintained standard forces to serve as your backbone  do you rely on ace pilot machines to be the main spearheads of your army and the real fighting force  or do you rather use super weapons like the big zam and appsaluss in mass to brush past enemy forces
  for space i tend to have carriers filled with a mixed force of grunts strong grunts and a sprinkling of ace units and/or scanner grunts if its the oyw or the start of a campaign i tend to also have light carriers or cruisers from my starting forces  for earth flight carriers with grunts strong grunts ace units with good land ratings and grunts mounted on flight units for land armies ocean armies will have a carrier loaded with aquatic grunts and flight mounted grunts if its the oyw its a clusterfuck of air carriers tanks planes artillery ms grunt ms and biome specific ms for land and a fuckload of air units for ocean
  i love to make squads of 1 ace unit and 2 mass produced ones
  there is kanji in it
  no but gundam uses so many made up or borrowed words i could totally see someone stumbling through on just katakana
i never expected to see a thread about one of my favorite games given how old it is now      it depends on what your situation going into the gryps conflict is but assuming you are building new suits from scratch and not just refitting existing ones i would go with the hizack for these reasons    1 it can swap its loadout between a machine gun and beam rifle which is important for dealing with ifield equipped units  2 it can be refit into the hizack custom which is an economical and effective unit for your lower priority aces  3 it can also be refit into the marasai which is good enough that it can achieve parity with axis ms like the gallus j as long as you outnumber them by at least 15x      so if you agree to ally with axis listen to chars objections and then get overruled by the anaheim electronics guy that does not meet the conditions for apolly to not die also assuming you manage to keep kamille and char following the battle at gryps two do you still get judeau beecha mondo etc
  the katakana would let him read unit names and weapon names anon the most important things to be able to read imo
best group
  are you me
  unit names sure but the only time you may need to read weapon names is if youre figthing ifield equipped units which isnt that often        you have a wiki that tells you what everything means and the google translate app is a thing that works like a charm so dont sweat it
  you do all the zz kids eventually join after you execute a recruitment drive project iirc you dont get to go through the tv series event tree but thats not much of a setback
  yeah but theyre all shit since they have no exp
  iirc you dont get to go through the tv series event tree but thats not much of a setback    ant path 760 and above alignment keep kamille and potentially fa if you choose to not let her leave if your alignment is perfect at 1000 and you did not align with axis char will also return to fight alongside aeug    zz path lower than 750 but above 250 kamille is mind fried and fa retires from service you get the zz kids early and can potentially get puru if you choose to not reinforce the argama at belfast if you reinforce hyato and puru will both die if you chose to follow the canon and your alignment drops below 500 by the time the zz gets the nahel argama they will leave with it and vanish    forever feddie below 240 alignment kamille retires fa gets a military discharge nothing positive is gained for aeug at low alignment outside of proto zero joining at the lowest possible alignment
  thats not much of a setback aeug games have you hard up for pilots for most of the playthrough since the vast majority of the cast is tied up in events anyway
do enemy factions not fight each other in axis v
  they do
  i had a situation where i was playing as axis and aeug just sat a huge army outside of gryps ll but never invaded can they not finish off opponents or something
  they cannot
i havent beaten all of menace of axis but i did play blood of zeon in the past extensively in the latter game the hardest scenario by a long shot was the one with the delaz fleet who has it the worst in menace
  federation even knowing what youre doing you can end up in an unwinnable situation very early on    i dont think anybody else has it rough so to say i find the aeug and titans campaigns annoying in terms of timing events  steal the mkiis a turn too early  the argama is just taken out randomly    rush as quick as i can to get four and rosamia  get four the turn after i needed her to defeat the argama
im really intersted in this series but no translation is a hurdle im just too much of a piece of shit to overcome  at least srw gets a bone occasionally
  axis horrible starting position not super great starting tech lots of insta lose events
  i feel the same these games are just so indepth which makes them interesting but also a complete pain in the ass to play without a translation  and the sheer amount of japanese to translate makes getting them translated an equally serious pain in the ass
  guy on gbatemp manages to figure out how to hack in different textures for the game lots of menu text is actually images and not text  disappears
   as quick as i can to get four and rosamia   four the turn after i needed her to defeat the argama    i generally just let the aeug take the gate of zedan after all of the colonies are suppressed in order to stop the jaburo invasion until i have both rosamia and four its also a good way to funnel excess forces building up granada into a location you can shoot them down in     it is unfortunate the titans campaign makes you choose between either    emma and franklin bidan one average pilot and a below average pilot  lila and the bosnia captain one above average pilot and a bench warmer  buran and ben wooder one above average pilot and an average pilot plus instantly getting your cyber newtypes to a rank along with a free mark ii    it would have been nice to already have buran and ben at the start of the campaign instead of having to earn them through an event that requires lila early sacrifice
  i fucking remember that guy he really seemed to be making good progress i wish more people would get interested in this series so we could get somebody to pick up where people like him leave off
  i was gonna say that fucking bamco could localize their next game seeing how the west actually still likes strategy games and everything but for that we would need them to make a new fucking game to begin with
  federation  just rush your projects you can deploy don escargots and saberfish in turn 2 which can deal with anything early zeon has with ease as long as you always attack them with several full squadrons and you have shitty units to screen your bombers then keep rushing till you get the gms
  correction you can build them in turn 2 and deploy them in turn 3 still surviving a couple of turns is not that hard
just finished playing a federation run i had the difficulty set to low honestly other than some hiccups against axis i was shoving forward almost the entire time i ended up needing to sit on the garden of thorns so i could have time to actually develop new gundams so i could get the events  my end game army was mostly gmllls followed by jegans xeku eins and a small number of hizack customs and ace units
  i think that hard is the best difficulty setting since it gives you a challenge without being totally unfair
  axis at least has a large pool of starting units even if the vast majority are obsolete the free neue ziel is pretty handy for all those space tiles you have to take since virtually everything is using beam rifles at this point they also have a huge pool of pilots to use and haman is one of the few toptier pilots who never gets locked behind longass event trees like char or amuro still their early game is pretty rough since you basically need to paint the whole map red from square one    personally i always found the aeug start pretty rough as well they have a tiny army basically have to keep their capital garrisoned at all times unlike most of the other factions and their cast of pilots is absurdly tiny plus you lose almost everyone except blex and that one captain lady when the zeta event tree starts at some point after that youre basically relying on alignment pilots for nearly half the game
    axis also has access to the big zam for production right off the bat essentially giving them a great vanguard unit to pierce into major bases like luna ii and the colonies axiss campaign has two really nasty spikes in difficulty the opening war with the titans since they can pump out psycho gundam mark iis and the period where aeug breaks the alliance and attacks you from just about every single frontline if those hurdles can be passed axiss campaign becomes very easy very fast
are there any advantages in choosing gyan over gelgoog
    i would pay good money for english translation patched iso
  you get the gyan instead of the gelgoog
  yeah the psyco mk ii speedbump is quite a hurdle for axis youre guaranteed to face at least two in the process of wiping out the titans and im pretty sure rosamia starts the game piloting one which is a nasty enemy to face the zssa is a good counter but more often than not i dogpile them with gelgoog marines instead since you have a surplus of them and you dont need to waste your precious earlygame capital    the gyan krieger is probably one of the most aesthetic suits of all time so there is that in practical terms however the gelgoog is probably the better option while melee attacks are strong you can only achieve a kill ratio of 11 during it the ranged phase of battle is where the bulk of the killing is done and the gelgoog line is just flatout better at shooting things than the gyan is especially the early models you could do what zimmad intended and pair them with rick doms but more often than not this just results in the front line of gyans eating beams in exchange for one gyan to get revenge by stabbing a single gm to death
    theyre better at killing battleships because of their superior melee attacks though
  in my experience the best option of the three choices you laid out is the one with lila emma needs a ton of exp to become decent and is still weaker than lila even when both at are max level buran is about equal to lila in abilities but getting him also requires following the path where you lose kakricon who is an emmatier pilotnot great but definitely not bad        have you guys actually played the delaz fleet scenario in blood of zeon you only start off controlling the garden of thorns a couple areas of space and some areas i think kilimanjaro  two other zones in africa you do have some very good pilotscima in her gelgoog gato in his gelgoog kelley in the val varo and delaz in his gwazinebut you also have almost no resources terrible income and your tech is horribly behind the curve you are effectively forced to do your best to defend africa while your only worthwhile units the ones mentioned above recapture areas in space and can then join the fight on earth your progress is glacial until turn 50 when you get the option to have gato steal the gp02 while it is possible to win without using it i hope you enjoy spending 200 turns doing so
    while i can agree that the delaz fleet scenario is far from easy you do get access to the big zam which makes large scale encounters far more manageable if you can hold out until that point in regards to menace of axis and which factions can benefit from the chaos/law alignment    federationlaw alignment aeug will give you access to the best aces in the game bar none  zeonlaw though you can get the puru clones once you defeat axis if you are chaos aligned  aeuglaw chaos will give you multiple crappy federation officers and one great pilot not worth trading off for 8 very useful pilots from law alignment along with the event based ones from zeta  titanslaw  axis technically chaos however you will be stuck fighting the glemy faction if this path is chosen once the titans are defeated you can get rosamia gates yazan ramsus and dunkel all very viable aces law will give you the two main characters from igloo and shin matsunaga     garmalaw chaos gives you cima and her unit along with kycillia and mquve lawful will give you amuro ray an easy trade off though time consuming    kycilliachaos become an absolute monster as soon as the campaign begins to get cimas unit along with scirroco and his proteges rain colonies onto the planet    casvalleaning chaos you do get the entire white base crew for being lawful until turn 80 but you can also get haman mashymere chara quess gyunei and nanai instead if you chose to go complete chaos     glemychaos you need to be fully evil to get his puru clones at turn 50 good alignment gives you mondo beecha and roux    delaz chaos you get glemy rakan and puru and the blue unit radicals in chaos alignment given the fact you will most likely be using the gp02 lawful playthroughs are impractical    scirrocolawful though if you can smash axis early you can get haman chara and mashymere on your side at max chaos    temno idea never played his campaign    char 0093law    quattro  law
so if we ever get a sequel in the future you guys want it to play like axis or you prefer the more straightforward approach like in shin  i feel like the map in shin was too small which in turn made navigating earth a pain cause naturally most of the map is water i prefer the more methodical area control approach from axis even if it takes a lot longer to play
  ive never played gihrens greed games other than axis how does the map differ
  the map itself isnt really different movement on the other hand is
  instead of the world being separated into areas its a huge map you can roam around freely with your units and there are bases around the world to serve you as pitstops and whatnot only the special areas have submaps like in axis when you reach one with your units you can go inside of it to try to take it down
in canon terms how much of an improvement is the gmii/nemo and gmiii over the 79 series theres so many variants it seems like the later models are minor upgrades over the c/g/n/quel
  gmii  practically the same shit  nemo  its based on the gm so again barely an improvement  gmiii   now that was a ton better basically on par with a gundam mkii which is pretty good for an mp suit at the time
  im not sure that canon agrees with your assessments    gm ii    this is way better than a standard gm in canon due to having an actual reloadable beam rifle instead of a nonreloadable spray gun and a panoramic cockpit    nemo    it has higher specs all around than the gm ii and uses the same luna titanium armor as the original rx78 it is far superior to a standard gm even postwar models like the kai    gm iii    it has design elements from the mark ii but that doesnt mean its performance is only on the level of the mark ii the barzam was the mp version of the mark ii and the gm iii is a later design that is superior to the barzam
  the gm iii is a criminally underrated suit its actually superior to the jegan in terms of speed firepower and power output although it cant maneuver as well due to fewer verniers
  wrong on gm ii man canonically its pretty shit especially compared to the gm command or gm kai its predecessors where all it has is the cockpit why do you think teetans never used it much
should i follow the white base events while playing as the feddies from what i can tell zeon will lose all the pilots they lose in the show but you lose a lot of them as well and other than not having to deal with the zeon units it doesnt seem like you gain much else
  if you follow them to completion youll lose ryu matilda and sleggar none of whom are especially noteworthy depriving zeon of a bunch of their strong aces and having a bunch of free xp on the white base crew is an acceptable tradeoff especially since the eff doesnt have a lot of ms pilots to start with
  in general for the oyw its best to follow canon up to near the end as the feddies but the reverse as zeon breaking it near the start by not resupplying char after he raids side 7
  no it would suck to end up with a lot of strong newtype aces and take out big zam elmeth and char with no effort at all
  and woody too i guess theyre not all that good though apparently you can save sleggar if you dont let them participate on the battle of solomon it doesnt say that deactivates the white base mode on the wiki just that you have to fight the big zam can any of you guys confirm me this      yeah zeon is definitely a no brainer char can go fuck himself      lalah char and the braw bro guy are definitely something i dont want to deal with
  if you choose not to form the 13th autonomous corps after they get to jaburo they all join you as regular units for the rest of part 1 this also saves sleggar but does mean you fight the big zam in the solomon battle its not really that big a deal i think this also saves challia and lalah from being killed
    nah man go to ramba ral and make sure hes get the doms  take out wb and iirc you also get a gundam
  you still get ramba rals event if you dont resupply char its just changed the reasons for him attacking instead of avenging garma its because dozle is pissed garma nearly died
anyone have an iso for the saturn original
  heyyyy thats that ps2 rpg isnt it
  yeah ms saga its lit
invade pekin with a fuckton of deep bombers flying fishes and tanks inside of medeas  start deploying guntanks and ground gundams  hey things are starting to look bright down there in earth  they start deploying amphibious mobile suits everywhere  the next objective is fucking hawaii  fuck my life
any of you lads play gihrens ambition for the ps2 while the game was limited to the oyw setting only it included    roughly 35 minutes worth of new animations  all combat is done in 3d instead of 2d  brand new event chart that is not based off the blood of zeon route  custom faction creator mode  loyalty system that can cause enemy forces to defect to your side or vise versa  bonus disk allowed you to add in 9 fully customized pilots into the one year war essentially allowing you to add anyone to your hearts content   while blue destiny and rise from the ashes characters and units are cut characters from msv and msx are added instead    game covers  msg  msv  msx  0080  8th ms team  parts of 0083
  i dont remember what it was called but the feddies get a plane that only attacks water units and from my experience they actually wreak havoc on their mobile suits pretty well don escargo i wanna say
  custom faction creator mode  go on
  custom faction mode  you can make anyone who is playable into your supreme commander including making your very own custom leader  you can also recruit up to 50 named characters into your army along with choosing your capital and what machines you want to start out with     potential base game scenarios include    january 3rd  febuary 1st  march 10th  may 25th  september 15th  the day garma died  the day odessa fell  the day jaburo was invaded  the day solomon was occupied  the day aboaqu fell    you can also choose free mode which lets you choose who will be the leader of the enemy factions you be fighting however it should be noted that what they start as and with will be randomized you can also have up to 4 factions fighting at once depending on how many rebellion factions form
does anyone have the full shin soundtrack the only one i can find are the eff theme normal battle combat phase and londo bell theme
  since i am a fast player so all my troop are prettymuch oyw unit the trick however is to use air plane a lot of them and let them enclose enemy and isolating them while your leveled up captian fire from behind always corner enemy unit 3 to one and place air plane on the front of the squad as bullet sponge
  i doubt thats practical even with round time limit the game would still take hours to complete
  get gyan and place a suqad of high combat stat charater in them then watch the fed cry
  plus some of the production centers are canceled/ changed through out the game
  yes after certein round char will return with oxygen deprivation symdrom but his stat remain the same
  interesting was this the one with diplomacy
    in its current form i doubt a multiplayer version of gihrens greed would be feasible what may make for an interesting way to make it work though    gameplay would be done in shin gihren/saturn version map format    two players take the role of supreme commanders of each respective army the supreme commanders do not command entire armies though they can take to the battlefields if they desire the true purpose of the supreme commander is decide how much money and resources are allocated to your armies across the globe which would be under the control of other players for example    supreme commander player revil  additional player 1 tianem   additional player 2 gopp    supreme commander player 2gihren   additional player 1 dozle  additional player 2 kycillia      rules    game will last 150 turns whoever has control over the other players capital wins a total victory if 150 turns pass without the capital being taken a cease fire will occur and whoever controls more territory will win a technical victory    if your supreme commander dies your game ends    if another additional player dies the commander they were playing as will permanently die however that player may be permitted to inhabit a new commander after a certain period of time has passed    while the supreme commander controls how much income each one of his admirals and generals will get whatever that income is used for is up to the players these players may choose to act outside the desires of the supreme commander sparking a civil war to stop that player from working against the supreme commanders interest if a supreme commander dies by the hands of one of his admirals or generals during a coup that player will overtake all assets of the defeated supreme commander     goals    supreme commanders take over enemy supreme commanders capital    additional players serve your supreme commander or potentially try to carve our your own faction during the chaos of the war
  that sounds like a game mode for a fangame im planning where you delegate everything to ais beneath you on the totem pole and take orders from ones above you
  the don escargot yes the problem is that you need at least a couple of full squads for them to be truly effective also while they rape acguys just fine the juaggs can fire back and unlike with ground units firing back at the depp rogs you have nothing else to use as a close combat screening for them and the biggest problem is that im not made of resources im still a turn away from getting the vanilla gms and every mobile suit before it has been retardedly expensive to build even the fucking mass produced ground gms for crying out loud i guess ill have to keep stalling them for a while
if i liberate von braun from zeon and then i leave on the next turn do i still get a penalty
  for the turn you spend there i think so but a oneturn chaos penalty is so inconsequential you can take the it and get it back almost immediately
  better that than zeon getting all those extra resources and money i guess the cpu cheats enough already
  additional player 2 gopp    it hurts to live
    sorry to say but in v the vanilla gm is quite lacking it was very good in a lot of previous installment so much that it barely works as a space garrison you should be faster in the initial phases as the feddies zerging and attacking everywhere you can just retreat in the same turn in order to make the ai scramble troops left and right while you concentrate on the bases the ideal pattern is to have hawai at turn 8 and kick off zeon from earth at turn 16 so you dont need expensive all terrain ms and zeon is fucked outputting their land based ms when you are stomping them in space
  gyan krieger is actually better than gelgoog jager  downside is no regelgu equivalent
  yeah the vanilla gm sucks balls but it lets you develop the good variants like the destert gm which is great since it has no penalties walking over any terrain other than snow and the aqua gm between those and the core boosters for air superiority its finally time to invade hawaii     have hawai at turn 8 and kick off zeon from earth at turn 16  yeah well its a bit too fucking late for any of that in my defense im playing on hard
    desert gm and the other variant are also mainly built with resource so you can recover almost everything you spent overall playing on hard you should keep the pressure on especially attacking/retreating on all your borders that makes harder for the ai to concentrate forces negating their numeric advantage due to the difficulty level
  not sure if it was in shin or axis or both but zeon has an ost that starts very similar to this one from empire earth    it was also used by history channel in ancient aliens and other shows
    technically the diplomacy function was mostly in blood of zeon though the ps2 version in mention had an investment system much like blood of zeon where you can send support to side 6/granada/jupiter energy fleet plus whatever companies were working with each respective side    if you are doing free mode you can potentially convince other members of opposing armies to form their own armies splitting how strong the opposing army is this can also backfire on your forces depending on where the enemy chooses to make its capital
    the best way to deal with aquatic mobile suits is to crush zeon quickly enough that they arent ever relevant
  based quints reveal truth
  having a fair fight is more fun though and by fair i mean the cpu cheating like crazy and you just outwitting it also the waterproof gundam is pretty sweet      yeah stalling and guerrilla tactics are the way to go is the ai less dumb in shin i may want to move onto that next
how is the dreamcast game i ordered it a few days ago
    the dreamcast version is just blood of zeon though ti has all been placed on a single disk and generally runs quite a bit smoother i also think it came preloaded with the content from the ps1 versions special disk which included extra scenarios
  i dont think thats possible zeon starts in control of several areas with waterlanes in the eff campaign including the production lines in new york/the eastern seaboard youll be facing msms at some point and i cant count the number of times ive been cockblocked out of an area because zeon decided to station a jukon in something like the black sea where it just zips back and forth denying it until i can move asw planes in
  well for the submarines you can simply use regular bombers the problem is when they start deploying amphibious ms that fire back at them
report that the titan fleet is invading grenada     fuck most of my fleet is on earth
  you should always have 15 or more units at your capital
should i save shiros leg having to deal with 2 apsaluses seems like a pain in the ass especially when im already focused on space but hes an ok pilot
  save his leg  kill the woman he loves  based anon
  i also saved matilda but let woody die i could introduce them to each other
  id certainly rather keep my two legs than keep my gf the latter is replaceable not so much the former
  neat
    the sooner in the game hawaii can be overtaken the easier the earth front in general will be    pekingas long as you hit it fast and early it should not be that bad just make sure you have a force keeping it from producing by turn 23    hawaiieven if you have to send in a tiny scout force to cut off production just stop it from producing and housing amphibious units if you can overtake hawaii north america will be a rather easy target with the rxseries most likely finished with production    odessathe big thing with odessa is elrans defection depending on how large zeons main force in odessa is it might be in your best interest to let elran defect while keeping a single big tray full of forces stationed on the edge of the map 50 of zeons forces will be destroyed and elran will defect if the force is small enough just stop elran and place him under house arrest though this deprives you a perfectly weak admiral to farm for promotion levels    kilimonjoro most likely the final invasion location on earth try to hit it from the south and north at the same time maybe even with some amphibious forces to whittle them down   ______________________________________    if everything goes well and fast zeon will most likely pull most of its space forces back to aboaqu opting to abandon solomon completely if they do not just make sure you have some spacebased shell units capable of clearing the big zam out     either aboaqu or side 3 will be the true test of the conflict though if you have the full armor gundam developed along with the burstliner you should be able to clear out quite a bit of its remaining army in no time
  its the same melody zeon has in axis v during the strategy phase they added some sort of choir to it
  i also saved matilda but let woody die i could introduce them to each other
the titan start is ass
  just get the zeon ending and he gets to keep both plus kai gets to be with miharu
  zeon will most likely pull most of its space forces back to aboaqu opting to abandon solomon completely  hey that happened to me just yesterday i played the game years ago and i dont remember that ever happening before i think it fucked up the white base events chain cause i got the event where they go to the texas colony but nothing else afterwards no braw bro and no ghost of solomon which sucks since ill have to deal with those from now on i guess
whats your best turn count for beating the oyw section /m/ either as fed or zeon    as i recall my best for the federation was 28 turns on normal while my best for zeon was 3032 on normal
  i usually end up delaying zeon playthroughs since the 0080 events dont kick off until the 90s or so if i didnt care about them i could usually wipe the map far earlier
  i forgotdo you get bernie if you dont do the 0080 events i know you start off with steiner mikhail garcia and andy rip
  you dont get him at all without going through them but the bigger prize is the free blueprints for the alex bernies kind of middling as a pilot and all the cyclops team dudes are already pretty good
  i think my absolute best was turn 25 back in blood of zeon though i will admit that i have gotten quite a bit rustier in menace of axis v i used to be able to establish an easy turn 3540 victory however i am not struggling to do the initial earth recapure operation     turn 1 deploy 3 fleets to attack all spaces next to luna ii all survive with no loses back on earth i also hit central america the gobi desert northern australia and greenland     turn 2 zeon has completely reinforced china to the point where a direct invasion is no longer viable even with attempts to build up troops zeon reinforces it even further space topples rather fast though gwazines tend to slow the advance
  blood of zeon had some mechanics differences that made it harder in some respects and easier in others on the one hand not being able to refit your units meant that it was really important to decide what you were going to produce and when and only to produce things that took more resources than cash gundams took four turns to make instead of just two or three when a carrier got shot down all of the units on it would be lost instead of just half on the other handand this was a huge dealyou were allowed to travel into new enemy zones from the tactical map so for example if you lured out most of the garrison from belfast into the atlantic ocean zone all you had to do to stop the production in belfast would be to slip a single saberfish through to the zone change this was obviously patched out in menace because of how cheesy it was if you knew what you were doing
  36 turns federation
  somebody should do a speedrun
my flagship in the gryps war is a stolen irish is this weird
  its always good to add insult to injury and beat them with their own weapons but im pretty sure there are better ships to use out there
  ive been behind on tech and the stolen irish plans were the best carrier i could make for several turns  i also have access to the nemo but dont have access to the marasai yet because i botched the story events
    this too
  well at least its yellow
i downloaded menace of axis and this to emulate on my phone today was wondering if there was a guide for the events in menace so i know what path im going down    also anyone know if theres an english translation patch for battle universe
  i prefer the straight forward approach of shin if i had shin with the content of axis and shins unique scenarios damn that would be dope
  here you go   
someone fully patched sd overworld  still not even a ui patch for this  fuck not that im complaining about the former as its a dank game but come on
  just look up the menu guide on gamefaqs and here is all the info you need for threat of axis v    also this dude on gamefaqs got inspired by revived interest in shin gihren so there is now an faq for that game too
  im very new to emulators and downloading games i want to play menace what would i need in order to run it on a apple or an android device
  an android build of ppsspp and the iso
play as the titan make all the mistakes the titan did    what
  if they made a new game we could get an asian release the bad news is that theyd need to make a new game for that to happen      i believe thats called historical defeat
should i even bother with the unit customization in shin it looks like a pain in the ass to try to balance it and im pretty sure i wont be swimming in money and resources past the initial turns
even when doing a completely lawful efsf do you all accept cima and her forces joining into the earth forces despite the money and alignment hit
  yes just to fuck over gato
  in the main supreme commander scenarios no outside of remodeling for cheaper production on certain units it isnt worth but for say amuro where the upgrades only change specs on one suit and not the production line go for it
  is anyone working on an english translation of this at all hell a machine translated one would be fine too as long as i vaguely know what im doing
  it cant be translated iirc the amount of work required isnt worth it at all something about the text being part of the image i forget
  why is her chin so huge
    both menace of axis and blood of zeon appear to have all text linked into images which make translation near impossible outside of directly changing every single imagine with text in game directly    i dont know about shin gihren but i think the same issue applies the only one that i have not heard anything about was the ps2 war for independence versionwhich appears to have editable text instead of image files for everything id almost be interested in seeing if an english patch for that game was possible
  why isnt yours
dont have argama mode on  never get the fucking barzam  why
  does anyone have the full list of clips from the older games every cutscene video ive seen never adds in garmas speech im sure theres others that are missing too
  theres no need for a gundam battle universe translation all mobile suit names are in plain english and the pilot names are in english in the gallery though with questionable results sometimes gyunei became gunneys  i dont know the mission objectives  theyre literally all destroy all enemies
  thats not reborn zeon
  do ramba and crowley join reborn zeon
  new animation   uploads never ever
  char reclaims his true name creates a new government for the earth sphere with all of the best and brightest newtypes coming to his side like lalah amuro bright  decides to drop a rock on the earth anyways  yeah nah
      they are somewhere on youtube lingering around somewhere
  i wish there was a way to rip the files
  because she is a bigger chad than anybody else in stardust memory
is emuparadise a good place to download emulators looks like they have the game and also an android psp emulator is that all i need or would there being anything else
  is this bait emuparadise doesnt have shit to download
  they took down links to stuff  id download ppsspp from their site
      should be a psp menace of axis iso
  makes sense thanks
  is there a guide for playing as subordinate commanders in shin
  honestly just do what i said before and go to gamefaqs myself and a few other people had resparked interest in a clearer way to play the game so a guide with links to jp wikis was made and there should be a forum post thatll give you more info
  you have plenty of time afterwards to get your law back up afterwards and she is a good ace
0093 char scenario is the best scenario in the game followed by amuro getting the hinu and unicorn rezels geara zulu reigning supreme you best believe
  aces are the single most important resource in the game because even an average ace think the white dingo dudes is a huge force multiplier in your favor this is a strong reason not to follow many event chains to their conclusionbecause while say having to fight the big zam at solomon sucks sleggar surviving and being a pilot you can use during parts 2 and 3 is a much better long run tradeoff    cima in particular is a very good ace zeon in general has better aces than the federation and cima is still in the top 10 for zeon
given how it has been well of 7 years without a new title in the series how would /m/ want to see another title in the series be made    stay in uc possibly extend into victory  attempt another gundam au in the same style  limit the game to 0079 only but have every single msvmsxside story and mainline major characters be playable  blood of zeon independence of space or shin gihrens gameplay
  put it on pc where strat games belong for one so i can actually play them without emulators  id prefer they stay in uc but dont drop the ball with postoyw stuff for zeon seriously in menace of axis you still fight haman who has mineva somehow even though the zabis are still around but wouldnt mind a seed version like said
  my ideal gg is one that would make a lot of people very mad  game is focused on putting as many factions in the game as possible  the five main factions from menace of axis plus the earth alliance and zaft get the standard detailed campaigns  as well we can set up custom mini campaigns having the alliance fight zeon or whatever  each faction will have its own simplified event tree for these  zeon might not invade jaburo but they might drop a colony if facing an earthbased faction  set it up so we can have three or fourway wars as well  the kicker  the rest of uc and the rest of the aus are in but only in this free mode  you can have the titans and une teaming up against zaft and oz but then the une turns on the titans because tiffa ran off and the titans snatched her up for newtype experiments
  so sd generations meets gg interesting
  interesting  heres my ideal  english
  by this point you may as well wait till narrative and hathaways flash are out so we can get more units and events
  a campaign mixing all the different gundam factions could work but id be way too front loaded given how most of the shows are oyw retellings i guess you could have endless waltz seed destiny 00 s2 and ages mid section for the grypps/neo zeon part and then finally introduce a late uc section alongside x turn a greco ages final part 00s movie and ibo
  the holy grail
finished a titans run i set the difficulty higher than my federation run and the result was that aeug and my army ground each other down into almost nothing i ended up sitting on conquests for a bit on the last points before axis would show up so i could have a large enough army to not get stomped by them and later on sitting on side 3 so i could rebuild after the disaster that was getting ambushed by glemmy and every single puru  i really dont like the starting position the titans have and the order you conquer territories feels really obnoxious which how much stuff you end up needing to defend ive unlocked most of the alternate scenarios and i really dont want to play another campaign with event faction spawns at the moment so ill be putting off playing as zeon or axis  my end game army was virtually all jegans with a small number of leftover earlier units and ace machines
  at least you got the best ending    titans  complete victory    the titans led by jamitov hymen won the battle and put an end to the era of constant warfare    jamitov who dismantled the corrupt earth federation government and gained tremendous power begins to act toward his true purpose    earth revitalization plan    a new human management system that involves forced relocation of the earths inhabitants    for the titans this is an act of betrayal and loyalty to jamitov is greatly strained    however jamitov succeeded in minimizing dissent by thoroughly pursuing opposition forces    as such human beings disappear from the earth    under this strict management system efforts to revitalize the earths environment are promoted    the souls of those who were pulled down by gravity have been set free    mankind who entered the vast frontier of the universe was about to enter a new era of evolution
any good videos on this game to watch
    here you go youll memorize the controls soon enough  itll be worth trampling over all those zaku iis with jegans and gm iiis thatll show those zeeks whats up 20 years in the future
  oh this is shin btw i play it because it looks nicer even though shin has a lot more content all the way to hathaways flash
  i remember someone trying to translate it but the english text was too large and trying to resize every single phrase would require finding the hexcode or something
  doesnt bamco release all their games in english in asia nowadays makes you wonder why dont they put them in the western online stores at least i mean i get it when it comes to srw but gundam they own that shit
i wish a new gg game would be made but given the current focus with gundam games for nearly the past decade seems to be mobile p2w arcade and arena shooters i doubt well be seeing one for a long time
  well actual video games are coming back in japan so its not over yet
  a gundam rts would make me bust a nut
  one year total war
  id prefer something tacticool like wargame desu    rip wargame
    command and conquer 0079
  id nut but this just reminds me how cc is dead as shit
  theyre gonna fuck up the remaster  screencap this
      screw all that what we need is a new girens greed that plays like a girens greed we could get one to promote the hathaway flash movies next year      ea  of course its gonna be garbage
  theres a mod for homeworld for gundam but i dunno if it actually works
    ive played it it works and its pretty fun it covers mostly oyw and i think some 0083 units and i think theres one or two zeta units thrown in the gundam mk ii and hizack i think
  theres a couple notably the uc and ce ones theyre both fairly wellmade though they only really work for skirmish mode and kinda grow old after a while
im surprised theres no cc codes or whatever that let me do officer mode with any character in shin
do you get chaos points if you occupy the neutral territories in the oyw alternate scenarios
  pretty sure thats the case yeah
  yeah i think all of the oyw scenarios you take large hits to order per turn until you remove all your units and it goes neutral again
  im torn on whether the next game if theres a next should have the shingihren or ps1 gg map i liked them both and they both had their pros and cons  stay in uc  have the game go from uc 0079 to uc 0105 pretty much the entire early uc era  include everything from toa v plus add zz msv some msx cca msv and units from unicorn and gnt  new factions the sleeves londo bell mufti  plot fleshed out to hathaways flash  some new mechanics  have it so that the main factions federation and zeon have an event that changes the leadership of the factions after at least the zz events with the new ruler being chosen based on your chaos/order score and event choices i always found it dumb that you had gihren and revel are still the faction leaders all the way up into cca events  combat should have an effect on tiles in the battle map heavy combat over a couple of tiles for multiple turns it into a ww1esque nomans land that has heavy defense bonuses  special weapons beam cannon or nukes turn the tiles they land on except water mountains space or colony into wasteland for a combat phase the wasteland tile has no defense bonuses  colony drops will turn the entire battlemap its dropped on into wasteland tiles barring water mountains for one battle phase
  id like it to stay uc and get a path towards victory but i dont think victory itself would be possible with that time scale i really just want more jupiter
  i think if they made a gg with victory in it it would have to be a separate game that started the game around f90 or split a game into a early and late uc    the mobile suits from the early uc are utterly outclassed by later uc in terms of speed agility and firepower having gelgoogs nemos and even jegans would be useless when your later uc suits can just dodge nearly all their shots and fire off a single beam that would pierce the shield and melt through the suit if it landed a hit
  shin with free mode would be perfect
  sure the games are already split in oyw and post oyw stuff anyway it wouldnt be an issue at all the only thing itd require would be some bullshit reasons for the bad guys to work together so you have a meaty tech tree there but thats certainly not a big deal
does anyone know the damage/accuracy calcs or have a link to a japanese wiki that could have them
    its an absolute tragedy that we did not get any other scenarios like chars cca scenario or some of the smaller scale ones like gyuinei and quess    pilot scenario anavel gato 0083  true end occupy jaburo cima did not arrive at the gwadan during operation stardust colony impacts north america ground forces invade jaburo  historical ending operation stardust cima arrived at delazs gwadan colony impacts north america  good ending operation stardust is a success delaz alive colony impacts jaburo  bad ending colony is destroyed before it can enter into jaburos atmosphere  pilot scenario jerid messa  true end occupy granada/axis joined scirrocos coup   historical end fail to destroy the rx178 kamille bidan before it reaches jaburo atmosphere  good ending occupy granada did not join in scirrocos coup jamitov survives    commander scenario ginias sahalin  true ending occupy jaburo yuri kellrene alive  historical ending fail to destroy the 8th ms team before shiro and aina make contact  normal endingoccupy jaburo yuri kelrene was killed by ginias
    this is the best quality we will ever get    it hurts
  good ending operation stardust is a success delaz alive colony impacts jaburo  successful colony drop  good ending
  if dropping axis onto the earth in shin gihren was considered a good ending given how its essentially completing the goals of neo zeon    successfully managing to drop the colony onto jaburo to destabalize the federation for axiss return would be considered a technical good ending for them    outright overtaking jaburo with ground forces would be the true perfecting ending though
    if a new game were to be made i would rather it be completely focused on the one year war brining in as much side story material as possible or it follows in the stye of shin gihren only with content extending from 0079 to possibly hathaways flash    colony drops are more involved a moving colony will become a major base space which can stopped if its engines are destroyed before it enters into the point of no return even gaining a colony will require an actual troop intervention of capturing an unoccupied colony or using g3 gas to clear others    it would also be interesting to make it possibly to change capitals in free scenarios where you will be able to have your central base moved elsewhere as long as you have a supply line connecting to it
  those colony drop rules sound kinda annoying
  for a weapon to be that devastating it cant be as easy as just paying a small fee and getting some free kills with it the main idea is to make the escorting of the colony a major undertaking to achive possibly having to push past entire federation battle lines outside your sphere of influence to deal that final devastating blow to them you need    the solar ray/solar system should also be slightly more involved than the version we got in menace of axis while also still being practical unlike the ones we got in shin gihren mostly in regards to its firing range being so tiny in that game
i remember i played this to death with a burnt dreamcast copy i dont know a lick of japanese but if you follow the translation guides for the menus you eventually just remember what each command does by heart and i stumbled my way through and beat it you couldnt pay me to pick it up again though unless we got a fantranslation patch
this is something thats bugged me since this morning and i know the mir helped out with rapid human evolution but did these guys ever have any backstory similar to the first ancestral race from eva and the protoculture from macross like was the the human race a direct offshoot in their evolved family tree when they didnt exist as long as these guys
  nope    exact opposite theyre not even from the same dimension
  some rough equivalent to a horizontal gene transfer from what ive gathered much like how a virus can contribute to your genome but youre not a relative of the virus
  spoilers thread confirmed as legit
  i still cant get over the tsunami of gullivers in the movie it sounded insanely stupid in the original spoilers thread but seeing it on screen    holy fuck the cringe
bump
the music strikes me as wildly out of place for a battle scene    also   song is called ballet mecanique    i see what you did there bones
  its not gundam so its not /m/
  eureka 7 is classified as a mecha anime shoo
  the spoiler thread literally already had pics of the gulliver apocalypse
  bretty sure thats not gundam or eva
  gulliver is unironically the best character in every e7 series/movie    more of him is always better
  looks like an evangelion to me
just watched the original series should i watch ao or any of the other spinoff stuff before the first hievolution movie
  play the ps2 games on pcsx2 then maybe pocket full of rainbows  then pretend like everything else doesnt exist
  if there were i dont remember seeing them spoiler thread just talked about it
    
  tv series confirmed dream  reeeee
how is lolbones still not out of business how can they keep pushing such unselling garbage for like a decade
eureka seven fucking sucks
if the goldion hammer does less than 4000 points of damage sure
i think people completely overestimate how strong an at field is its not completely impervious to conventional weapons because they actually manage to damage some of the angels with those remember that they had to attack israfel with a ton of n2 mines and shelling after it defeated the evas the first time also ramiel was defeated by a highpowered rifle    so any sufficiently strong force can damage the at field evas arent just a convenient plot device to fight the angels now get out
  its not completely impervious to conventional weapons  but grav shockwave isnt conventional weapon that why i asked
    ramiel was defeated by a high powered rifle designed specifically to breach an at field and then dumped and absurd amount of extra juice in it a tactic that worked exactly once the other times they break out the positron cannon it fails to penetrate     otherwise you are right it is technically possible to break an at field and kill the angel within without another at field the force needed to do so however is just fucking excessive in the leadup to the same ramiel fight that they used the positron cannon in they say that the magi predicts they can destroy ramiel with a wave of 108 n2 mines in rapid succession but the damage caused by it would destroy the entire underground fortress as well     which is believable because a single n2 mine is enough to turn a mountain into a crater they are significant stronger than modern day nukes just tactical and focused on direct damage rather than wide area of effect     what we can take away from this is that if you want to breach an at field by sheer brute force you have to use a weapon that will destroy literally everything you can see in all directions if it is used and put the entire region you are in way below sea level and thats just to kill something as strong as ramiel some later angels had much more powerful fields
no
    id imagine so yes    the goldion hammer is strong but it doesnt do anywhere near enough damage to break through an at field most of the time it just dissolves a single target and at its absolute strongest it doesnt do anything that a nuke couldnt have done too     and as we know evas are functionally invulnerable to nukes
  what if guy shouts about courage while using the goldion hammer
it doesnt surprise me this was the inspiration for eva
  it was better than eva thats for sure
    youre a piece of shit which is also unsurprising
  stop shitposting tomino and go back making greco movie as good as you can
why is it that every time an ibo character was going to die theyd spend the first half of the episode telegraphing it and infodumping their life story  is it because the writers didnt expect you to give a shit without that
  i mean its not very difficult when the bar is already set so low
  honest question doesnt everyone in gundam do that i cant think of anyone who didnt do that except utterly irrelevant people     ibo at the very least had a complete and selfcontained story 00 had a movie where they fought aliens and saved the day with a huge metal flower
    why would i bother trying when youve already made it clear youve closed your mind to the possibility that i could successfully do so
  i mean when you have a lockon clone /twin brother come out of nowhere the idea of ibo being better is pretty appealing
  sir please stop your fighting /m/ think of your hot wife and child 
  one cannot convince a fool
    i dont remember getting ryus story the episode he died or emma or tomas or gavane etc
  i could successfully do so  thats /m/ for  talk that i like to eat farts
  as much as sii made si even worse in both cases
  op has my respect for being so brave
     the possibility is there apparently equals ill definitely succeed    im not guy shishioh but i suppose that attitude is appropriate given the board
  i cant think of anyone who didnt do that  other gundams feature them prominently in the episodes they die ryu spends a fair bit of sorrow and hatred hobbling around feeling sorrow for himself matilda poses for that photo in black tristar etc but they dont get much backstory or setup theyre already established as characters theyre there because theyre in the narrative everything you know about matilda is established by this point pretty girl everyone loves her loyal soldier etc hell more time is spent showing other characters saying how much they like her than actually having matilda be there we learn nothing about ryu from his episode past the fact hes frustrated they dont get a scene to stand around monologuing about the starving orphans theyre fighting for and about how they got beat up as kids or whatever they do the same stuff theyd normally do in an episode to move the plot forward
  op ii always loved you  please dont sacrifice yourself for us we need you
  thats like saying that tetrodotoxin is less poisonous than botulinum technically true but either way its going to kill you something can be better written than 00 and still be shit
ibo didnt have mommy in it
  00 start as literal alien tier technology   get btfo by government  ibo start as literal slave garbage people  never lose a fight
  better written  if repetitive dialogues and plot line melodrama bait reversing obvious deaths in s1 just to be exploited for melodramatic deaths and telling back story of a character only a moment later to kill them off come counts as better writing to you then probably you mistake your mcsoftie soda drink with prime château wine
  ibo starts as old op gundam  gets owned by rods  gundam 00 starts with mission to end war  it ends ayy lmao war as a bonus
00 is an improved wing  ibo is a shittified dougram
  i cant think of anyone who didnt do that  because clearly you havent seen any
character says he has a brother he never ever mentioned before or even implied he had  immediately after this cast is attacked by villains that include said brotherly character  brotherly character dies just one episode later  quality writing
  won with huge metal flower in 00  tekadan lost in ibo  metal flower lost ibo  ill give you this
  compare to the second lockon who had buildup leading into him as early as the first episodes of s1
    hell even the concept of alien contact and the flower were set up throughout s2 so its not like the situation is a complete asspaul
  then instead of than  americans stop posting
  yeah cause its not like ibo pulled the oh yeah i actually have a brother that i never talk about that just so happens to be relevant now card    twice
  who makes threads like this
  complain about how the story was told vs being annoyed that you didnt like ayylmaos
  00 had a movie where they fought aliens and saved the day with a huge metal flower  if you think that makes no sense then its obvious that youve never seen 00 and instead just read plot summaries
  for whatever reason this cesspool of a site attracts the lowest of the low people who probably arent a bit right in the head or werent raised right or perhaps a combo
  its than not then besides 00 was fantastic
  i cant think of anyone who didnt do that  hayato mashymre chara ryu cima most of the cast of zeta kyoji/schwarz corin nander   probably a ton more but theyre the first ones to come to mind
  most tomino shows explicitly do not do that  most other gundam shows kill off more significant characters if they want shock value who already received focus during the course of the show instead of having to cram it in one episode
  one scenebuild up  the amount of logic loops that /m/ has to make to help their 00 argument is really sad
  who makes threads like this  and you choose to be apart of the problem
  its better than fucking ibo thats for sure
  i mean when you have a lockon clone /twin brother  i do not accept that lockon or nena trinity died  the clone or whatever thing is daft
  fuck i hated that when it happened  i was baffled how normies ate it up otherwise they would have nit picked the hell out of it
  apparently the innovades and the trinities are all genetically based on dna donated by aeolias friends and followers nena is supposed modelled on one of minas ancestors and iirc one of the people that went into seclusion with aeolia is a brunette that suspiciously looks very similar to tieria
  implying ibo is better  that is the real sad thing
that hits way to close to the mark fucking ibo does that for every important death it makes it near unwatchable     thunderbolt is better then both of them
  the only problem is your autism
  i dont have any investment in either series so all this shitposting over which one is the worst ever seems retarded to me people act like its as bad as e7 an or something
  thunderbolt is better then both of them  how
  but it did and even better ones jesuc christ are 00 fags ignorant retards
  amerifats cant into english
  cute tummy
was kinues death as telegraphed as the ones in ibo was it more subtle was the lead up better did it have more of an impact i felt a lot more emotion when kinue died than biscuit
whats your favorite song   
  god taste  
  groovy    everyday i sing this song   
  i mean if were doing j9 series stuff  fushichou layla    abayo fly bye   or my soul journey 
    man when is that new anime coming out
gattai getter robo  
  man i am so glad i watched this show i wish i could go back and watch it for the first time again
  if im ever feeling down i listen to this to get myself pumped up   
  
  
fukkatsu no ideon  isao taira  
armored trooper votoms opening  
  never creator died
  gan gan gan gan    probably my second favourite
  
  
macross ed  runner  
for me its a tie    kosumosu ni kimi to space runaway ideon      makurosu sdf macross  
macross op full  
king gainer ending song  can you feel my soul  
  
i know some people doesnt like victory season but i fucking love it i prefer star saber over optimus prime and the intro its one of my favorites  
ive got a real soft spot for layzners op    honestly though most of the stuff in the thread already are absolutely top songs    this is a fantastic little album too its not really layzner but it kinda is at the same time contemplation is a real favourite of mine
  also honourable mentions to these two songs      sometimes you just need a hotblooded kick up the arse and these songs do that very well
  i liked victory since it was more in line with a normal transformers show i didnt like star saber  his design and attacks looked cool but he was too much of a hero of justice im still mad about what happened to ginrai who died and it was entirely star saber fault for being a huge fuck up that episode then he gets turned into victory leo who ends up being a completely new character and hes a magic mushroom
        damn how come they dont do songs like they used to i mean wheres the emotion and the feeling of fighting for justice and shit
  best song in the show not up for debate      popular musics changed my man got to adapt to survive
  alltime favorite    current jam  
  yeah right but what about the feeling theres something heroic about most of the opening songs most recent songs just are bland and lacks that fighting spirit in favor of someting catchy
  i agree ginrai didnt deserve that shit i guess you can blame sponsors for killing and turning him into a powerup
ichiro fucking mizuki  either jeeg or getter robo armageddon op  
  yeah just found out about it  oh well
never a dull moment for me to listen to this     i never not want to listen this even after months and months and approaching a year     current mood song tho is    trigger is bringing it back maybe a little too close with that full power sword finish still a great scene just wish it was a little more original in animation
posting a classic    
    that first be silent gives me chills so fucking great
goshogun   gold lightan   dorvack 
              
  this song is amazing holy shit is the shows score as good as this op
    good taste anon
  
        
im loving kohei tanaka right now         gravity rush has mechs flying battleships etc and sea wasp is a cyborg p      queen    
    
      brain powered did not deserve a yoko kanno soundtrack    
    queen    its close enough to queen

hey anon i wanna get into mecha where do i start  how do you respond
  by dumping her asian/latino mutt ass
  thats a fucking dude
fuck off cunt yknow back in my day we didnt have anyone to spoonfeed us i remember downloading shitty 240p avi crabstick files thatd get stuck halfway through and that way i knew which shows were good or not do some fucking work yourself you entitled millennial bitch
gurren lagann then i start being a cringelord by quoting the show and posing
  code geass macross frontier or gundam 00
  nadesico and patlabor  possibly ironically but not 100 sure about it
  nice try todd howard i know its you
  it depends whats the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of mecha we can narrow it down from there
  you will tell me your secret
  dont trust her she only asking you so she can make fun at you
  keroro  ditf  a/z  valvrave  eva  xenoblade except x  w gundam
  legend of the blue wolves
  with my dick bitch ass cunt asking me to recommend giant robot anime that youre going to drop a week later and declare mecha to be not your time when anime in general isnt your interest you fucking cunt ass bitch    i think the first evangelion rebuild wouldnt hurt to get them interested in the characters and then transition to the tv show
  anon i love you
actual answer full metal panic
  the best mecha show to watch as your entry point is gundam build fighters
  my man
  wtf anon this is just toys eww for kids just like transformers
  oh my god stop youre going to get me in trouble again plus its distracting and i struggle with this math shit so turn around before mr bixnood notices
  meme answers aside if somebody wants to find out more about mecha its best to explain that theres a lot of different stuff and start a dialog about what sort of things theyre looking for in a show what they like in media and so forth
  genocidal organ
g gundam its what got me into the genre
  i dont know like i want to see realistic badass women beating bad guys something like that
  mr bixnood who are you talking with
  short answer  lol you suck at faking girls
  macross  horney ronery night
  0080
  there arent as many as you might like but i can still think of a few try the girl who leapt through space that has basically an allfemale cast godannars an option maybe its pretty gratuitously smutty but its also got a lot of badass female characters who get as much or more accomplished than most of the men id understand if you were offput by all the fanservice though
  shit fuck fuck shit you see what happened ya cunt you baited me into this you dont care about mecha just getting a cheap laugh for your snapchat thots i hope the irs gets their asses handed
  realistic  get yo bitch ass outta ere cunt bitch ass bitch
  depends what do you like there are actually multiple options for entry into the genre just like you have multiple holes i want to violate ha ha
  entitled  selfentitled you udder rudder
  mr bixnood anon pls stay behind
  what a tryhard response now she thinks youre gay good job
  votoms episode 3
  the answer is gunbuster maybe you should study for the test next time
  she gonna be wet for your great taste in mecha
  nah chicks love a chance to run their mouth about stupid shit they think    i mean come on you dummies i know youre a chan but have you ever even talked to a girl
  she might be flip  yell erikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa at her and check and if she doesnt get it ask for her moms number
  a woman asking about anime come on i know this is 4chan but come on
  mr bixnood shes been bothering me so i cant focus on this math shit
  jokes on you shes right
i bet the neon green stick monster with the shitty hair is some sorta cyber newtype
  eva and chill
  code geass  yikes
  its for a girl it works
patlabor and iczer one  works for me
  girl talking to me  by cumfarting for one
  oh i didnt notice the pic xd
0083    its basically top gun so its really accessible had awesome mechs and good art its also go a simple plot but enough to get her intrigued about uc and uc is the only mech anime worth watching
the agreed upon answer you will find online is gundam reconguista no g that way if she makes it through and likes it you marry that girl if she doesnt then you know she has an almond for a brain and you pump and dump that shit but when you cum you yell at her how the world isnt square
watch transformers
  its basically top gun  careful there while 0083 does have some massive gayness to rival top gun with kelly and kou citing top gun sets the gayness bar really high for many chicks
macross dyrl evangelion megazone 23 gundam 00 or code geass are your absolute best bets as an answer in this situation if shes a weeb then add gurren lagann in there speaking from personal experience
  votoms episode 3
  not wanting the perfect genetically engineered wo/m/an gf
i got a girl into mecha once but she didnt let me get into her its not fair i tought that was an implicity tradeoff
obviously the only thing youd rec to a normalfag girl would be macross
  you get her into gundam the next time you see her she has zeon loges on her bag and saying sige zeon unironically what do
  dude wtf i took it up the ass from the guy who taught me how to watch robot cartoons sluts just dont understand how the world works
  my cockpit  where you will see  gundam 00  gurren lagaan
  let her do a colony drop on your dick
  is his name sam    im sam and i routinely bang a dude up the ass that i taught about mecha
  ewwwwwwe
  benis
ehthat depends if youre looking for strong female leads such as buffy miss marvel she hulk and wonder woman youll find most of the genrelacking that isnt to say that those shows dont exist its just that i havent seen them and/or know about them    that in mind lemme give you some suggestions and next time we meet up we can go from there alright     first up is one of my personal favorites gaogaigar basically a kid joins a quasiparamilitary group that has a robot lion that combines with a bullet train a drill tank a stealth bomber and an astronaut to form an even bigger robot and kicks all sorts of kaiju ass it is awesome and ballstothewall and so very intense i love it to bits theres even a robot thats a rock star no really    next one is mobile suit gundam its a space opera of sorts but not a galaxy spanning one instead it takes place here in our solar system main gist is that the space colonists revolt and a lot of innocent people get caught up in the crossfire between said space colonists and earth if youre able to id say grab the original broadcast if you can there is a movie trilogy that consolidates all the key plot points but its more meant for fans who just want the story and none of the fat so to speak    theres also evangelion loathe as i am to even suggest it its about giant robots that fight monsters but were supposed to feel bad because nihilism theres a scene where a fourteen year old boy masturbates over the comatose body of a girl his age and somehow people think thats the highest form of art anime can achieve by the by if you ever find yourself agreeing with those people while you watch this show please do the world a favor and take a long walk off a very short pier    then theres gundam 00 basic plotline is that a paramilitary group decides to enact world peace by using giant robots capable of extreme violence and this isnt presented as a good thing    1/2
  i have a hard drive full of stuff we can watch it at my house
i prefer girls who wear glasses so i wont help
    2/2    00 takes a very nuanced look at the themes it presentswell as nuanced as it can within two seasons at any rate a good starting point if youre new to gundam too     theres also tons of other shows out there but that should be enough to get you started and know what i think i might be able to loan you some dvds i have and maybe see if i have an extra hard drive lying about so i can put some of the shows on there since some of them arent available in the us quite yet keep in mind not all of these will play properly in windows media player so ill have to include a video player as well if that worries you i suggest running a virus scanner before you touch anything from the drive its supposed to be good practice anyhow    now lets get back to the lesson before ms drexel overhears us
  fuck off normie never  me again
  oh fuck if my highschool self were in this situation id probably do something cringey like say uh i dunno and pretend to be uninterested to protect my fragile ego
  this dick lol
  there are people who actually believe women cant like mongolian pictograms
  gundam drink my seed
  realistichuh you might just love zeta gundam
  votoms episode 3
  i fire my colony laser into her wall fucking zeeks
you are evil /m/ you hate good shows like gurren lagann gaogaigar macross frontier gundam seed eureka seven and evangelion you only care about how cool the mecha are and how good the animation is and if the characters are your toxic ideal of manly and very little about what said stories say about the world you insult woman writers and sympathize with fascists you even had a thread a few pages back where the op admitted to hating jews if life were a super robot/sentai series you /m/anchildren would be among its villains
was the sociopolitical commentary really necessary
  seed  good
  its on now  behold za powa of za powaaaaaaaa
  only care about how cool the mecha/animation are and if the main characters are manly  but that applies to both super and real type robots whats with the need to shit on one or the other
good shows  macross  l  o  l
  literally hitler
gain control of media through nepotism  use newly acquired power and influence to harm host country with mass immigration  get surprised when people get mad
  fuck off
  you only care about how cool the mecha are and how good the animation is and if the characters are your toxic ideal of manly and very little about what said stories say about the world  but that describes gurren lagann to a t i also love it and like most stuff in your list and the only jew i ever met was a fat chick i feel pretty indifferent about
  gurren lagann  sucks  macross frontier  shit  gundam seed  vile trash  eureka seven  mediocre  evangelion  trash     fuck off
  you only care about how cool the mecha are and how good the animation is and if the characters are your toxic ideal of manly    thats just not true anon i care about things as well
  gurren lagann  favorite super robot anime  gaogaigar  favorite 90s mecha anime  macross frontier  gundam seed  never watched em  eureka seven  favorite real robot anime  evangelion  not my favorite but i think its still pretty good    i dont know what you mean anon i also think i have some jewish lineage on my dads side
  /m/ isnt a collective and most posters dont hate those shows posters who frequent a certain other board tend to do many of the things you are describing and are very vocal its usually not more than one or two posters at a time
  /g/
   hating jews  but hes my best favorite newtype ever
  gaogaigar is in my top 10 anime of all time and the main reason why ive stayed on this board since 2006  dont actually mind most of the other anime in the op gurren lagann and evangelion arent bad but theyre not the goat mecha anime people unfamiliar with the genre say they are frontiers fine as a whole e7 was okay but literally everything after the original tv series has been stuck in a downward spiral with no signs of stopping seed has a pretty good ost and is only retroactively awful if you include destiny in the mix  am a sucker for all kinds of seigi no mikatas in various /m/ shows    i know this is probably just a bait thread but i just love all things hotblood
its gundam still popular in japon or its just a niche now
ill leave that for you to decide op
japanese kids saying mecha is lamejpg
  its still the top selling anime franchise in terms of overall merchandise sales every year by a pretty large margin so yeah totally niche
how gundams have changed japan  
    its religion son
  anal material
  you cant have her just look at the cover at amuros eyes she is amuros to use as he wants with before handing her to his best friend hayato as sloppy seconds
  nt is selling out theaters everywhere
  more info anon
  source
  its literally star wars of japan  also dead too
name more than 3 good macross shows
  name any good gundam shows
  well lets see  0080  0079 trilogy  zeta  cca  g    thats 5  never watched across btw
macross plus
i like more macross designs than i do gundam designs
  sdf macross  macross 7  macross delta  macross frontier   macross zero  macross plus
  the only thing macross has over gundam is the fact the developmental lineage of its mecha is handled with actual care since kawamori does all of it  it makes the macross world feel like its progressing naturally and lived innot that uc doesnt  in gundam the main timeline has been whored out to so many people with different creative visions that its become a mess of canon and you cant really form a solid consensus without theorizing half the technology element of its worldbuilding    other than that gundam and macross are fairly equal in everything else  i just wish the later would be a more active franchisenot to the extent of gundam though its getting oversaturated now
  when i imagined how hot a meltrandi using a car for a vibrator or jumping onto meltran tits the size of a large home would be
  id agree if they hadnt made frontier and whatever the last show was called    i hated the plots for both and the battroid modes look way too anorexic
  macross  aka gundam for pedos and weebs
  sdf macross  macross plus  macross zero  macross frontier    7 may be about space hippie rock bands but it has a gorgeous artstyle some of the best looking main valkyries in design and colours and the art is amazing for a tv series throughout delta and frontier movies are just one big pile of fuck you to all the macross fans      gundam igloo  gundam 0083  gundam 08th ms team  g gundam  gundam wing  gundam x  zeta movies  gundam thunderbolt  gundam crossbone
  macross  who is that chick op i dont remember seeing her in any season of robotech
  theyre not that big meltrans are only like fifteen meters tall their breasts wouldnt be that large
when i watched macross 7 and decided it was my favourite chinese cartoon
  7 frontier plus delta
  lmao 0079 had a scene with the 6 year old girl fully nude in the bathroom and the main antagonist is a legit pedo gundam is the pedo show
  delta and frontier movies are just one big pile of fuck you  should i watch the tv shows then or are you just saying those series suck in general
  i think he means delta as a whole and the movies of frontier seeing as he listed frontier as a good show
im currently watching through macross 7 and im having a ton of fun so far but i honestly just dont get basaras character at all he wants people to listen to his song but he wont give the people who actually want to listen to it the time of day and mostly only plays for them when someone shows up to try and kill him    gamlin is best boy
from someone who likes both franchises but with a preference to macross sdf  msg  macross 7  turn a  g gundam  0080  victory  plus    further analysis gets muddy
  just keep watching youll either learn to understand him better and your perspective will change or youll still dislike him also shut up and listen to his song
the tv series is pretty good plus is great dyrl is pretty shit havent watched past there ive been watching gundam in production order though recently and everything before f91 has been great with f91 still being fairly good i thought for sure id like macross more but it didnt turn out that way
  the frontier movies are a great complement to the show skip delta entirely unless you hate yourself
after watching flashback 2012 its a visual masterpiece and it made me remember why i loved anime    
  it aint sucka    say hi to jetfire/skyfire for me
  is that masked man a doozy bot
  music show vs mecha show  hmmm
  never couldnt get into macross cuz of the jpop
  never couldnt get into macross cuz of the jpop  skip to macross 7 then only good rock songs no idols or jpop
  basara is a dick throughout the whole show and everyone loves him weakest part of the show mwanwhile best boy gamlin is surrounded by cuckery and never gets the good things he earned still a great show
name any good gundam shows    gundam crossbone    i wish 
dyrl was the most beautifully animated garbage ive ever seen seriously who wrote this crap looks nice atleast
i tried to watch macross and its boring as shit plus and ii are the worst and put me to sleep with all of their mellowdrama and schmaltzy romance crap tried to watch an episode of 7 and all i could think is how retarded aliens are for not understanding what kissing is     robotech is superior and i hope harmony gold never loses the rights to it
  
  it doesnt even really stand out that much with its art and animation though it certainly does look nice but its not a benchmark in any way really
  bait
  delta and frontier movies are just one big pile of fuck you to all the macross fans  you mean the type of macross fans who watch it for the cool dogfights you mean
  when i watched the most praised gundam series and the least praised macross one
  it always bothered me how its super obvious that mylene has a different va for singing
when the sexy space vampire had the orgasm to rock and roll i wish that kind of thing happened more often instead of all that idol crap
    basara has a different signing voice too
  thats true but it just doesnt stand out as much to me
  yeah but that singer also did the gainer op    what else has mylenes singer done am not really one to follow musicians/groups
mylene is voiced by aya hirano in uta macross  i hate it
when did the 36 of you realize you just fell for a spam thread
    what makes you think we didnt know and just wanted to talk macross while shit posting gundam
  because you would have realized you are enabling the spammer to keep spamming if you did
dyrl was fucking shit and made me drop this franchise
  i think her career didnt go far after m7
  this is on you guys 
    tbqh fukuyamas solo career didnt go that far after macross 7 too in fact the only song i can remember from him is makka na chikai        but then theres all the jam project songs of which hes a member so theres that
  what else has mylenes singer done  not much in terms of music but shes the mother of actress hana sugisaki rukia from bleach and rin from blade of immortal so thats probably her biggest contribution to the anime world
considering that ive liked every macross series ive watched and have never been a huge gundam fan    even my favorite gundam series turn a is kinda uppermid tier in my book and my least favorite victory is one of my all time least favorites
  stars in crappy live action anime films    not what id call a dazzling career
episode 8   yuta choosing gridman over waifu bullshit  yuta is literally our guy
  /a/  living in delusion with the waifu  /m/  choosing to face reality and be with best friends
anybody like the initial fighters colors more than the normal one
  nah
  yuta is a man of integrity he rightfully rejects akanes nihilism disregard for human life and faces reality    unfortunately the characters who choose to reject the fake reality always gets bashed by certain fans yuta the mc from ff tactics and a few others come to mind
is that a fucking ultraseven and mandarake reference in one shot  i came
any more plagiarized shots in this episode
  plagiarized  dont try bringing back a dead meme
  i probably would if grid knight existed
aoi kajitsu
  best ultra opening by far desu
  implying its a meme
  yep
  no elbows  cant get anymore showa than that
  sideways knees  so retro
  the knees are where the drills and the tractor connect
  strong brick
  while i think gscs proportions and engineering look far better than the actibuilder one for gridman and full powered gridman man its nice that they tried and that it all combines in a way thats show accurate but they should put out a separate zenon figure with proper joints and stylized a bit    some of the sentai dx toys still arent much better the lupat line still has no knees and outside of the two dial fighters has no elbow articulation not to mention proportions like this 
  really my one complaint with the gsc dx set is that borrs drill cannons arent painted on the inside otherwise its fine id rather it be fun to play with and i feel like giving it any more articulation at this scale and price range would just be a mess
  zenon figure with proper joints and stylized a bit  it wouldnt be accurate since it has no elbow in the show either
  jesus christ its like everything went downhill after engineoh g12
  when the toy engineering is actually canon to the character model
  no way
  you be trippin
  this was an awesome figure isolated on its own then you start adding components and it already looks like an endshow clusterfuck with weird kibble hanging off its stomach with only gorilla and rabbit added
  ace is okay but gobusteroh is a mess
    it was designed by mugenbine team    also all gokaiger mechs are awesome especially gozyujin
  the mc from ff tactics  to be fair his cripple brother can actually walk in ivalice so anyone can see why hed prefer to stay  the bitch had a dumb reason to want to stay there bawww my hair is white in real life and mewt was a bullied kid  thing is they were all gonna die if they stayed so
something that i noticed is that the lyrics for akanes theme was in backwards on episode 8 and the one used in episode 6 is an upbeat techno version of the same song
  thing is they were all gonna die if they stayed so  while marche was 100 right none of them knew that mewt was being manipulated by a literal soul sucking demon until the last mission or two
    man the usual dudes taking a while huh what happened to that anon that did the typesetted subs on youtube too its been a day
so who else is enough of a toy nutcase like the guys at trigger to get this reference because i know i did  in the original gridman ippei gets inspiration to make the assist weapons combine into a single robot when he sees a robot toy that was given as a present to his little sister thay toy is a repainted jumbo saber from dagarn the third yuusha show  gotta love these obscure references      this the point of the design is looking like a 80s90s robot toy when articulation was completely secondary to transformation the lack of elbows is a nod to that
  we purposely gave it no elbows as a tribute  typical
  the thing has no elbows in the show either and were talking about trigger here so of course it was on purpose     the show designs also have these things that are used on robot toys to keep the parts together pic related the guys at trigger sure love this shit
do you want more ultraxbrave type shows like gridman
  i want a show like shinkalion but with brave style the shinkalion toys dont look good and when they do they cant transform  more toku robots are also good because sentai robots are dogshit nowadays
  give me a spinoff series about galactron going on adventures and dispensing justice left and right
  what else is there aside from gridman and i guess ultraman x
he reminded me leon from garo in this episode
  nexus is the only ultraman that had 2 openings right i really love the first one
is this suppose to be a throwaway ref or is ir suppose to mean something is there a chance that akane might actually be gay im not talking yuri fetish pandering here just wondering if shes super miserable because of alot of things about herself it would be crazy if they actually go that route im saying this because the poster on the right seems to likely fit with her character could be the same for the right
  shes actually about to die of hiv/aids so she created the virtual world with alexis to delay her death
  akane is not gay she chose her yuta to be her boyfriend in a dream scenario which she had complete control over instead of rikka as a girlfriend
  leo had two opening a too
this is the director of ssss gridman akira amemiya  say something nice about him
  hes actually saving anime
  fuck off back to /a/ yurifag
  inferno cop is still my favorite work from him but gridman has been great too
  youre almost at 2 for 2 mate dont fuck it up
  shes not gay she set up yuta to be her boyfriend she even set up a romcom meeting for the first episode   oops i forgot my lunch  here have this extra special dog i have   but then those volleyball girls ruined everything
  i dont think shes gay cause shes defo open to relationship with boys at most shes bi   its all probably just a product of her extreme need for a connections to people though
  3 for 3 you mean he did ninja slayer too
  hes restoring my faith in anime and the future of mecha
  she chose her yuta to be her boyfriend    she set up yuta to be her boyfriend  reading way too much into that she set it up to appeal to what she thinks boys his age likes similar to how she set up utsumi with things she thought hed like rikka is the only one she has any actual feelings towards since she setup how they first met to recapture their friendship from before she got here
notices that hes caught in the matrix because he has good things happening to him  just how shitty is his life
  rikka is the person she put the least effort for approaching in the entire show  fuck off back to /u/ or at least contain yourself to /a/ faggot
  if i had to guess not as bad as he makes it out to but but the poor guy possibly has some selfesteem issues a sort of i dont deserve this nice stuff thing i may be projecting a bit though
  i mean imagine if you met some cute girl that had an /m/ powerlevel on par with yours helped you buy a bunch of rare shit and then even invited you over for some fuck sounds like a dream doesnt it
  rikka is the only one she has any actual feelings towards since she setup how they first met to recapture their friendship from before she got here    youre reaching a bit there rikka is just the designated best friend akane made with her digital wizard sims power their connection is quite shallow as it is forced akane needs someone to feed her ego and stand by her no matter how shitty of a person she is and rikka only thinks of her as a friend due to her programming not because she genuinely likes her you can even see it in the dream bus scene and is actually becoming disdainful towards akane    i want the yurifag to leave and go back to /a/ your /co/derived mentality is showing it skews your view
  hetfags this assblasted that rikka is going to end up with akane instead of their bland selfinsert mc
  your tumblr is showing actual faggot
  rikka is just the designated best friend  unless you missed the more focus akane gives her the completely different feel rikkas dream has and the ed rikka was someone akane knew and was very close to irl which is why she has a more defined character than someone like utsumi who is an entertaining yet one note ultraman nerd since that was all akane knew of him you cant deny this
  rikka is the person she put the least effort for approaching in the entire show  so youve just been skimming thread and not actually watching the show then
  you sure its not you thats seeing things
  being a best friend doesnt mean they want to scissor each other  the show gives zero hints at any romantic involvement between the two of them the only person in the show who openly yearns for love and relationships is yuta
  some anon literally counted all the onscreen time rikka and akane spent together and its the least out of all interactions between the main characters in the entire show  im so sorry for your awful taste in ships
  no its more you refusing to see things will they go full lesbian probably not but you cant deny that akane is closer to and has more affection for rikka than anyone else and you cant deny that rikka and akane were close irl before whatever happened to make akane want to runaway to the virtual world
  and yet they hold more meaning quality over quantity
  you cant deny that akane is closer to and has more affection for rikka  was it rikkas house she visited and tried to playfully caress the pillow while commenting about her scent  youre insane shipperfaggot your kind should be banned from posting on this board
whats his fucking problem
  and yet she has no real care for yuta all she has done it try to appeal to what she thinks he wants but has shown no real care or desire for him other than a tool
  seems more like akane sees rikka as the weak link and is trying to exploit her since shes preprogrammed as bff
  unless you missed the more focus akane gives her  thats because unlike the other residents of tsutsujidai who were programmed or whatever you wanna interpret it as to just like akane in general only rikka with the sole purpose to be her best friend the one that should keyword should always stand by her no matter what happens shes her emotional support/egostroking machine and she gives her more focus for that purpose so akane would have her goodfeelgenerator pet around shes also the most likely in the gridman alliance to switch over to her side because of her programming unlike yuta and utsumi    and the ed  franxxs ed had much more powerful yuri signals in it and it ended up one of the most antigayshipping anime made in the past few years    rikka was someone akane knew and was very close to irl  literal headcanon we dont even know if any our characters actually existed in the real world before nothing about the worlds nature has been explained beyond akane being a god in a simulation    which is why she has a more defined character than someone like utsumi who is an entertaining yet one note ultraman nerd since that was all akane knew of him  highly subjective now youre using your own rating of character depth as some sort of narrative evidence    your entire post is headcanon just stop
  his head is on fire
  and yet she has no real care for yuta  she has no real care for any of the main characters staring with rikka who she treats as a tool for her own wounded ego
  have you considered that what yuta wants is what akane originally programmed him to be
  he just wants to have some fun
    he didnt become a space patrolman like his cousin ovah justissu
  remember how akane comments on her and yutas fake boyfriendgirlfriend relationship as what should have been youre literally delusional fuck off gayboi
yuri shitposting has found its way here  welp its over it was fun while it lasted
  of course not its just cosplay
  thats because unlike the other residents of tsutsujidai who were programmed or whatever you wanna interpret it as to just like akane in general only rikka with the sole purpose to be her best friend the one that should keyword should always stand by her no matter what happens shes her emotional support/egostroking machine and she gives her more focus for that purpose so akane would have her goodfeelgenerator pet around shes also the most likely in the gridman alliance to switch over to her side because of her programming unlike yuta and utsumi  because they were clsoe irl before their friendship broke down so she made rikka unable to hate her so she wouldnt lose her friend again  franxxs ed had much more powerful yuri signals in it and it ended up one of the most antigayshipping anime made in the past few years  franxxs ed visuals were more about what the girls wanted there really werent any yuri signals there  literal headcanon we dont even know if any our characters actually existed in the real world before nothing about the worlds nature has been explained beyond akane being a god in a simulation  the ending and rikkas dream akane made for her show us how they met and were before all this its called visual storytelling  highly subjective now youre using your own rating of character depth as some sort of narrative evidence  except rikka has had more depth and character than the rest
these threads go bad because people start whipping the most bizarre accusations towards each other at the drop of a hat you cant even discuss theoreticals without it becoming a completely manufactured us versus them thing its lame
  whats his fucking problem  his name isnt as cool as khan digifer
  more commenting on how they should adore her instead of impeding her
  because most people speedwatch
i know alot noticed that the buscene with rikka and akane was a role reversal but did anyone noticed that the scene when rikka went to the infirmary was also a role reversal    rikka already on the bed while akane just entered
  his name isnt as cool as khan digifer  nigga alexis is like the coolest name ever
  alexis is a girl name like camille
  its not role reversal shut the fuck up shipperfaggot
  alexis is like the coolest name ever  it sounds like a girls name though
  go back to /u
  no thats not even the issue but even if someone did and even if they were completely wrong who cares
  oh shit if you buy two you can give gridman 6 arms like a mecha asura a second max on the shoulder drills and a second vit on the back tank treads        youre not helping you pussy
  i just mentioned its a role reversal how the fuck am i shipping them at all
cant wait for the show to completely btfo the yuritard so he goes completely silent
  because they were clsoe irl before their friendship broke down so she made rikka unable to hate her so she wouldnt lose her friend again  headcanon again we dont know if rikka existed outside of the simulation    franxxs ed visuals were more about what the girls wanted there really werent any yuri signals there  i know youre not blind so now youre just straight up lying on the internet    the ending and rikkas dream akane made for her show us how they met and were before all this its called visual storytelling  eds are eds going back to the franxx example they can either mean nothing or something and your bias is making you take the latter for fact     except rikka has had more depth and character than the rest  subjective again    dude cant you just search for gridman yuri porn to satiate your cravings or something or watch something that panders to your need to have gay characters in a cartoon which the west is now rife with    dont force it where it doesnt exist
    girl name  lemme guess youre american
  i never even ship rikka and akane dont be so fucking hostile i just said she might be gay based on the lgbt poster
  i know its technically a gender neutral name but its a very girlysounding one
  oh dont worry his and all the other faggots bubbles will be popped in the next 3 episodes
  none of that is headcanon we have clearly been shown all of this if you want to reject the deeper storytelling just say so but dont go saying things arent there when they very clearly are
  head is star saber too because old xenon was optimus so its a double reference      close / fuck do you ship your friends with their parents and pets too you sick fuck
  there is no helping it as long as people are dedicated to shitposting
  fuck off /u/fag
  on the poster of all things    you must understand shippers are one of the most annoying creatures on the internet they shit up everything they touch and youre being one right now even if you think you arent    so if you really dont want to be misunderstood as a shipper fag stop
  this show isnt deep you just dont read books
  what if they did why do you care where do you think you are
  youre shitposting too
  ill be sure to call you when the show destroys your faggot ass so hard you wont be able to make a post anymore
  hes not voiced by tim curry
  we have clearly been shown all of this  where how do you know the infirmary scene isnt all made up by akane or even the memories in the ed for that matter
  how       this sort of over the top kneejerk reaction is far more annoying
this scene in the first episode made me think that yuta confessed to rikka just before he collapsed and lost his memories
  i want gridman in srw      why are you getting so defensive do you actually diddle puppies and want to bang your mom or something
  i guess i will you all act as if youre getting attack for no reason at all could have just told me that it could be a throwaway poster for the sake of it but no even when i already said i wasnt shipping anyone at all some of you feel like im trying to ruin your show
  he probably unknowingly ruined the friendship between two of them while doing so too
  lemme guess youre american  no from europe i know its gender neutral and in fact i knew of a guy called alexis but still sounds girlish
  space
  im just pissed that this show is impossible to talk about on /a/ and it looks like the threads on /m/ are trending that way now too and this is what i mean about the bizarre accusations
  this sort of over the top kneejerk reaction is far more annoying  thats not much coming from you you know your insistence at presenting your headcanon shipfest as fact is a million times more annoying nobody wants you here look at how everyone here in the thread is telling you to take your ass outta here    some people are just incapable of noticing when theyre being a nuisance and you sure are one right now
  thats exactly what a shipper would say get your shipper ass outta here i bet you ship borr and utsumi too sicko
  they go out of their way to shoe the infirmary scenes calendar showing that its the past in addition to rikkas comments about how she and akane used to hang out but havent for a while the ending is set in the real world by how normal it is everyones in uniforms instead of the casual clothes people wear in this virtual world and it shows and gives context to how they met hung out and then suddenly stopped so the show can focus on the bigger impact moments from how they fell out of favor with eachother
  head is star saber too because old xenon was optimus so its a double reference  the face reminds me of goldymarg more than star saber both goldy and zenon are robots that turn into equipment/weapons for the main hero
  bro your hostile reaction shows you belong in /a im just trying theorised like i always do before every episode if stuff went differently i wont be angry at all like you fantasize i would sorry to make you unhappy
  man i should have fucking known this is where we were heading abandon ship its over it was nice knowing you /m/ this is the first and last time im getting involved in this topic
  if its shipping than i would go with what the show is clearly intending which is rikka and yuta
  this is the first and last time im getting involved in this topic  good thats a relief
  you will never experience the call of mecha over all other route in life because were stuck in reality
  i hope you keep replying me like that when the show utterly btfos your shitty yuri headcanons
  no we need to address why you seriously think beastiality and incest is no big deal now i really was just trying to get you to see how stupid shipping is with dumbass hyperbole but i didnt expect you to actually defend beastiality and incest and im dying
  sign up for volunteer firefighting its as close as were going to get
  what the fuck sort of logic is this i didnt say bestiality and incest are no big deal i said what the fuck are you talking about because you brought up bestiality and incest out of the blue what im criticizing is how youre making your accusations not precisely what they are even if i was that wouldnt be a defense of them
          whens the next draw thread i want pick related dressed up as kerib with her hair partially on fire
  utterly btfo your shitty yuri headcannon  i guess bringing up theories can really affect someones psyche huh
  i feel like the bus scene was partly reality akane and rikka probably had their roles reversed like the beginning of the episode rikka got popular and akane drifted away
  are you looking for a duel girl
  its a totally girly as fuck variation of one of the most overhyped western names around     also if you say it backwards it banishes them from this dimension
remember when everyone got mad when someon theorise that the ending credit had canon relevance to the show and got ridiculed for no reason what can you even talk about in this thread
  oh boohoo just stop you fucked up just take it and go
  you said  so what if they thought that being a platonic friend family or pet meant that theyre lovers     and youre a yurifag who ships akane and rikka therefor you think its ok to rape dogs and shit and its on the same level as lesbeans /a/ degeneracy at its worst
  what can you even talk about in this thread  cool robots and toku action
  i guess the lessons is only try and talk about airing shows the day a new episode comes out
  yamete yugiiiiiiiiii
  every thread on /m/ was fine until this one    actually yesterdays is still here    you whiny lil bitch
  does the thread allow me to have an indepth talk about kai ikarashi style of storyboarding or should i stick to saying everything is kino
  what can you even talk about in this thread  justice
  hanase
  we were talking about that yesterday and the discussions are stilll there its not our fault that youre blind
  yeah the last thread was fine but it wasnt because of a lack of speculation just a lack of retardation
          sokkou mahou hazudou    baazaakaa soruu    duro monsta kaado    duro monsta kaado    duro monsta kaado    duro monsta kaado    duro monsta kaado
  i wouldnt know that since you get mad at every little thing can i also talk about the clever use of ost or the lack of ost
  haha oh wow somebody is taking things abit too too personally
  think you got the wrong gridman thread mate this isnt the /a/ thread things are pretty chill around here
  its not even worth responding to just let it rot
  no one has every stopped you from posting things like this if you werent whining so much and being so passive aggressive if you posted that no one would even know or care that you annoyed them because were all anons so nothing stays in peoples memories or is taken personally itd just look like a sensible person replied    everyones only replying to you because you got butthurt
  yeah stopped on the shot when they were going to hold hands together and yuta making the first move  if the episode director wanted to convey adoring than impeding they shouldve have a shot where everyone smiles at akane
  i was pretty butthurt though
  i like if colors but it definitely makes gridman look weaker remove the headcrest and the shrink the shoulderpads and it would be perfect as a low power mode gridman
thread is comfy here should i bring my /a bros here
  bringing in foreigners  please dont
  if the episode director wanted to convey adoring than impeding  that is what they were trying to convey she doesnt really care for yuta everything in the dream is dictated by akane the food they eat where they go and what they do yuta is just a passive receptacle with no say just like some preprogrammed worshiper hes just a tool to her
  she doesnt really care for yuta  this but thats only because she doesnt care about anyone  her current broken emotional state and seeking rikka for support is entirely because gridman keeps winning the gridman alliance keeps rejecting her and how yutas actions are changing people around him something she cant do herself
  that still ignores that the shot where they were holding hands she said this is what it shouldve been like if he wanted that to comment for everyone the director wouldve shown everyone in one shot than just yuta and akanes hand   besides what everyone already said akane also made rikka to be a tool too she was literally stated to be a friend no matter what     i wouldnt even call yuta a tool in akanes mind hes more of a dog that bites the hand that feeds since she hated how gridman stops her if you want to fit that in your fan fiction    she cares for yuta not in the way of love since she wanted him out right dead by antis hand or at least join forces when she went into his room     also on the poster about puberty why do everyone always think puberty is just hurr durr i want to fuck its not only about that for some its about changing attitudes and seeing the world differently and getting more emotional in anger depression like akane was feeling maybe its connected to that no it must mean shes gay because thats what puberty always concludes and other stuff     i cant wait for you to cherry pick my argument like how you did to my first post
  debunks argument compltely  calls it cherry picking  someone is butthurt
  that still ignores that the shot where they were holding hands she said this is what it shouldve been like if he wanted that to comment for everyone the director wouldve shown everyone in one shot than just yuta and akanes hand   shes referring to everyone and the shot is showing yuta as being one of akanes programmed drones its not about akane wanting to be yutas boyfriend because she doesnt its about having power over hims and pacifying him with what she thinks he wants as he has really only shown attraction to rikka so she overlays that with herself to pacify and control him not because she likes him but to get him out of her way and force him into the crowd of her programmed masses   besides what everyone already said akane also made rikka to be a tool too she was literally stated to be a friend no matter what   and the show has shown us that the tow have had a stronger relationship/friendship that stems from their past that went south so she made rikka as she remembered her and made it so she wouldnt want to leave her  i wouldnt even call yuta a tool in akanes mind hes more of a dog that bites the hand that feeds since she hated how gridman stops her if you want to fit that in your fan fiction  yuta is a tool to her thes gridmans tool to ruin her perfect world she only cares about him as far as it applies to how him disturbs her world but not as a person  she cares for yuta not in the way of love since she wanted him out right dead by antis hand or at least join forces when she went into his room   the only true thing youve said all thread
  also on the poster about puberty why do everyone always think puberty is just hurr durr i want to fuck its not only about that for some its about changing attitudes and seeing the world differently and getting more emotional in anger depression like akane was feeling maybe its connected to that no it must mean shes gay because thats what puberty always concludes and other stuff  the puberty poster applies to that however the lgbt poster right next to it can also imply that she was getting those thoughts and feelings as well and maybe that was even the cause of the rift between them
checked  absolutely yes doubledubs man      absolutely patrician taste my friend      its actually a male name short for alexanderthe female name should be alexia not alexis
  and the show has shown us that the tow have had a stronger relationship/friendship that stems from their past that went south so she made rikka as she remembered her and made it so she wouldnt want to leave her  im pretty sure its one sided on rikkas side
between these threads and the ones on /a/ its incredibly obvious that its the same idiot with enormous amount of headcanons who keeps stirring shit up last week he spanned the threads with akane was lying to rikka to make her hate her this week is trying to deny that the roles inside the dreams for all 3 characters were different he does the same shit on /u/ i have a suspicion he is the person who even started the thread there   dont reply and ignore the fucker he is not worth your time we will finally be free from his autism in a few weeks when his last headcanons will crumble    on a side note i do wonder whats going to force anti to switch sides next episode and how he will even be able to gain his own access code any hints from other toku shows
  whats going to force anti to switch sides next episode  the power of friendship
  akane was lying to rikka to make her hate her  what how
  anti bring out gridman  calibur okay but you have to join our side first  anti okay done now bring him  calibur gridman doesnt fight his friends  anti fuuuuuuuuuuuuu
  genius
    debunks argument compltely sic  calls it cherry picking  well i was arguing that the directors choice in shot and dialogue made it seem so that it was her wish for a relation with yuta i never said that it was the case as i corrected in my second post with she cares for yuta not in the way of love since she wanted him out right dead by antis hand or at least join forces when she went into his room     she only cares about him as far as it applies to how him disturbs her world but not as a person  i literally did just compared yuta to a dog so i insinuated she didnt care for him as a person    and the show has shown us that the two have had a stronger relationship/friendship that stems from their past that went south  im not sure if it ever went south since she was literally born to be a friend maybe a little bit distant before the events of the show but never really stopped until now if you were to tell me that the dream sequence had cannon parts ill seriously doubt that with alexis kerib being there i think its pretty fabricated all the bits after alexis kerib if alexis kerib being there was cannon then she couldve brought it up when yuta was talking about the alien with akane when max seconded in on believing it    but ill concede with the other points  btw im not the one whos been arguing for all this time just another anon ruffling in threads
  hetfags  not a thing
  i do wonder whats going to force anti to switch sides next episode and how he will even be able to gain his own access code    anti brrrrrrrr  calibur click hello  anti where gridman at nigga kaijuus been shitting on the crib and he aint here  calbur ssorry lil nigglet gridman aint feelin it and we got our hands full with some other shit  anti be there in a sec click    access code anti dragon    anti nobody beats yo ass but me nigga
  give anti an official code and connect him to gridman  this makes him physically unable to fight gridman as he is now his support weapon  wont it be cruel though
  the point of the design is looking like a 80s90s robot toy when articulation was completely secondary to transformation the lack of elbows is a nod to that  then explain the elbows on the toy that inspired the original god zenon
  its actually a male name short for alexanderthe female name should be alexia not alexis  yeah but in the englishspeaking world is actually more used as a female name
  i do wonder whats going to force anti to switch sides next episode and how he will even be able to gain his own access code  i think caliburs the one whos going to make anti switch sides turning him into the ssss gridman version of dyna dragon maybe they end up gattaiing in order to take out the flesh suit kaiju
oh god it really is him i saw him on fucking /ck/ of all places once
  inb4 calibur is actually older takeshi and he does it by writing some program for transforming kaiju into support weapon on the fly
  yeah in my experince boys are alex and girls are alexis literally never heard alexia in my life
  calibur is a hyper agent though
  then he access flashes into sigma
  the elbows dont interfere with transformation in jumbo sabers case in fact theyre needed for the transformation as the arms use that joint to split into the two motors under each wing now take a look at powered zenon the arms are actually boots for sky gridman and max power gridman so theyre hollow inside nowadays they could design some weird joint in there if they wanted but you can be sure that back in the day they would have been bricks like in the new goodsmile and megahouse toys even if the show model had elbows thanks to the animation magic    the point is that trigger knows pretty damn well how transforming robot toys worked back then and just made a tribute in the show as someone whos been into these kind of toys for twenty years i really appreciate their passion about it
    
  i feel that sigma if he even appears isnt going to be related to the gridman aliance  maybe theyll use that scrapped plot sigma had  in the third quarter of the series takeshi todo was meant to steal gridmans data and become khan knight a rival character and khan digifiers servant before redeeming himself as grid knight
    i just want to believe that all of this is happening inside the original junk and is a sequel that will connect to the boys invent great hero short at its climax with takeshi turning into sigma and fighting in the real world    then the last episode is a mix of animation and actual footage with the scenes out of the computer as toku and the ones inside as anime
  found rikka/shattered glass megatron
  when takara used a currentyear at the time redeco of a toy from sunrise for another companys show
another shit episode  oh no no no no
  meanwhile the original g1 dinobots are chilling in naotos room  and now we have the bay dinobots as actual characters in the show
trips say akane dies and yuta rikka and utsumi are all altered grownup avatars of naoto yuka and ippei
  grownup  theyre like the same age what do you mean grownup
  and alexis is residual data from khan digifer after he got destroyed or something im all for the sequel aproach
  have you watched the original theyre children the ssss trio are high school teens
    the digits have spoken
    well i cant argue with these numbers
is grid kinesis a term from the original show
  what kind of telephone is that
  ive checked and yeah it is but i guess it only appeared a single teme because i dont even remember when was it used
  telephone  pretty sure thats just a hair dryer anon
    the state of his office makes me panic internally
  thats exactly how the office of any /m/ animator should look
  its a hair dryer and theres a kaiju inside that turns people into  delinquents when they use it protags mother turns into a dominatrix
  its pretty much like my room but less cluttered
  yup this definitely triggered me
worst ani/m/uh evar
  it sure does
  what episode
  episode 35
    pretty sure its from the dream episode gridman is able to force naoto out of his dream state by transferring some of his energy over to him
    yuka turns into tranny david bowie
  so into a lessfabulous david bowie
  these threads go bad because people start whipping the most bizarre accusations towards each other at the drop of a hat you cant even discuss theoreticals without it becoming a completely manufactured us versus them thing its lame  welcome to 4chan
  fuck
  dont fuck up the ending and youre gonna be the best director in trigger  also look at that shit eating grin
they finally meet each other
  i highly doubt they got the pull to actually do this
  dont screw it up
  you sure i got called a /u fag for saying that rikkas ver of the dream in ep 9 was a role reversal where in reality rikka was the popular kid whos cool calm and collected
  i got called a /u/fag for saying rikka had slightly more focus than yuuta for all of two episodes personally these threads were/are indeed pretty chill before that autist came in to shit it up with his leaked /a/ shitposting though
a new official kaiju musume design from ssssgridman     she got a really nice dong    
  the ssssgridman twintail kaiju doesnt also have twintails  instead is futa  im not complaining but 
episode 10 preview  アカネが学校を休んだまま怪獣の現れない平穏な日々が続いていたアカネが作った最後の怪獣はあっけなくグリッドマンに倒され不気味に立ち尽くす    the days where akane was absent from school and kaiju did not appear continued the last kaiju made by akane was swiftly defeated by gridman and eerily stood back up
  its like they deliberately hammering it down hard enough then shows us the reason why a little later to make marche atrocity justified    then theres ramza guy
  lightning attacker looks better than orb trinity
  every time i see gridmans face i always thing of optimus primal really hoping trigger can do something with transformers in the future
  also know as visual kei
  theres one shot of akane thats literally shinji smiling in the last episode of eva
i hope well get to see human sized gridman at one point of the show
  i just hope we see a crucifixion at some point
    whats an ultra show without crucifixions and christian imagery    mfw redman kills monsters by impaling them with crosses  oof
  i dont think powered had any
perfectly good sluggerlike head crest  when the fuck is he gonna use it i thought it was inevitable considering tsuburayas recent obsession with sluggers
  the days where akane was absent from school and kaiju did not appear continued  tumbling down  well they might as well knock on her door she lives right there
  itll be the last resort weapon when everything else fails
  anybody like the initial fighters colors more than the normal one  did gridman start in his shattered glass colors
  thats an important plot point the moment akane or rikka dare to step inside the others house the story ends
  funny how they were both inside each others houses in this dream world then
    i dont think great did either which is even weirder considering it had both konaka and sho aikawa writing episodes for it
    the western ultraman didnt have any crucifixion
  so basically akane will be the core of the flesh suit kaiju
is that the guy in suit kaiju on the far left whered you guys get that information    also can someone post the episode description leaks again please
  doesnt know left from right
    shit im fucking shit up    i mean right im sorry
  its technically the kaijus left
  i can buy every kaiju being a man in a suit bar the ep4 and 5 ones
    welcome to /m/ the same board that people shit on because it went through an identity crisis for whats considered /m/ or not and its still a problem to some today   jesus what did you two expect sometimes on 4chan no less   i mean 4channel    besides whatever post you two made doesnt compare to these         
  if you want a real shocking comparison just take a looksie over at the horrifying clusterfuck of shitposting that is the /a/ thread right now
  the episode 4 one could easily be a suit
  yuuta forever alone like the rest of /m/     always go for the pussy justice is just a fallacy
  always go for the pussy justice is just a fallacy  congratulations you have officially uttered the most beta thing anyone could say on 4channel today
  getting pussy  considered beta  god damn you sjw are cute
  putting pussy in a pedestal  absolute beta
  stop making it so obvious anon
  the chad walk robot 
  putting pussy over your personal values and ideals  revering pussy  i can feel an aura of sheer betaness emanating from my screen
takeshi damn it those fools  why why wont anyone treat me kindly why wont anyone love me  khan digifier heh heh your hatred are growing stronger takeshi    takeshi no one will recognize me this world is bullshit thats it this world is fake it doesnt exist in the real world i am a cute girl wearing glasses and have big milkies that everyone likes i am the most popular kid in class  khan digifier whats wrong today youre are more twisted than ever before    khan digifier alright i shall use my power to make your twisted desire come true takeshi    takeshi eh what what do you mean  ababababababashi    akane yawn good morning alexis  alexis good morning akane kun  akane i feel like i was in this strange dream  alexis hahaha looks like you are still not fully awake yet
          you all need to get off the computer
  he created a fun wellanimated show
  hes usink akane to make monsters hell eventually attack the real world with
  if that was the reveal id give the anime a standing ovation
  this but thats only because she doesnt care about anyone    yes and no i think akane genuinely wants friends and that many if not all of everyone in the city are based on people she knew in the outside world but with their personalities and behaviors tweaked so that she instead became the most popular girl in school     i see her relationship with yuta going two ways either she had intentionally dragged him in and gave him amnesia or yuta took the place of a copy of himself she made and the process of doing so is what gave him amnesia either way akane had feelings for yuta and something happened between them on the outside that was a big factor in akane retreating into alexiss world
  if you buy two you  anon that is like a fresh soc ggg but no diecast who do that
hhi is this where we go for shelter from the /u/ shit storm
  fuck off
the whole jumping thing makes me think that akane has tried that sort of thing before i wonder if despite having apparent total control over the city shes actually unable to leave like the one thing she cant do is experience the real world alexis is obviously manipulating her and playing the fool but the question is to what extent
  either way akane had feelings for yuta and something happened between them on the outside that was a big factor in akane retreating into alexiss world  you mean rikka the staff have even said that rikka and akanes relationship is a focal point of the show akane does not have feelings for yuta
  does anyone have the spoiler list
  next episode xxx joins the gridman alliance along with yuta remembering who he was and the next episode after that is the final battle
yuta has feelings for rikka rikka might or might not feel something romantic for yuta we honestly cant tell she is pretty distant regardless akane doesnt have feelings for yuta
  its 11 episodes long i did not expect that short that means dragon shows up and 11 is when we get grid flash i can easily see them resolving the show but thanks
  its 12
i want to summon him so badly
  well i made a mistake yuta remembering is the 11th episode not 10th so its  10 xxx joins  11 yuta remembers  12 final battle
  lets discuss like civilized persons what the writer meant by this  interviewer at the start of the show i didnt think that there was any interaction between rikka and akane however as the story progressed a connection between them became more and more apparent was it intentional to show the story this way   hasgawa the reason is that script for this work is for the most part written from yutas point of view so even if at first there was no apparent interaction between akane and rikka he starts to discover various secrets and the world that the audience sees starts expanding since akane and rikkas relationship is the part that becomes the key of the story please look forward to it in the future
when will takechad come /m/
  please dont
  summon who
  other threads about to die he needs a place to live
  something sinister is going on
  just fucking dont i want to discuss
you guys should come over and check out the /a/ thread its a lot of fun
  what a fucking nightmare  i never go to /a/ but i decided to try it tonight has this been happening every week what a shit show  no wonder people here tell me to stay away from /a/
  that specific guy is everywhere on every board for some intense autistic reason
  i went and it looked like half the fucking thread had been deleted what the hell happened
  has this been happening every week  yeah theres maybe a day where proper discussion overwhelms the shitposting but the rest of the week is just one autistic little fuck mass replying and accusing anyone and everyone of things hes doing himself it was unbearable at first but now im having fun with it
  hell be back with a new ip in just a few minutes
      im now morbidly curious about who ack is
no need to bring that shit here
  your right best to keep in its original containment thread
  it could honestly be either way the way i see it is that akane in a way took rikkas place especially in this episode notice how akane was surrounded by friends on the bus and rikka was kind of lonely despite how people talk about her and treat her as being cool and popular rikka is almost always keeping to herself akane wants to be like rikka and definitely wants to be friends with her but felt unable to approach her maybe it was rikka and yuta going steady that convinced her to run away to alexiss world no matter who her affections truly were for them getting closer together made her feel even more isolated     then alexis came and offered her the chance to construct a paradise for herself gridman and yuta learned of this and infiltrated alexiss world in the hopes of freeing akane but yuta lost his memory along the way alexis is definitely using her and her world torwards some nefarious end part of me thinks that yuta and gridman were already working together to fight evil in the real world     the only thing that has me leaning towards akane having romantic feelings for yuta is that in her ideal world which follows what i presume to be what would have happened had gridman not intervened akane became yutas girlfriend and rikka was mostly left out in the cold until akane became her friend
  anon no youre reading the episode wrong akane was giving yuta what he wanted that was the point
  isnt it funny how in akanes ideal version of events things still kick off with yuta having amnesia why would she do that in the dream world where she could clearly rewrite the memories of those trapped inside of ithence why no one remembered gridman or her kaiju shenanigans in the dream     what if yuta didnt lose his memories infiltrating akanes world but akane asked alexis to bring the real yuta in to her world because she had a crush on him alexis would obviously wipe yutas memories so he wouldnt notice the difference between the real world and akanes world     i bet she tried more than once to get closer to yuta but got distracted by killing the people who got in the way by the time the main series started shed become a lot more callous and willing to kill on a whim hence why she was fine with anti killing yuta but then switched to wanting yuta to join her
  but its been established that yuta likes rikka
  see this is the kind of theory that is just really really embarrassing to read beyond being gridman yuta isnt special in any way to akane they dont share a previous connection
    meh i just think it would add a sinister twist to the otherwise relatively innocent desire to live in your ideal world
  yes but rikka is cold and distant towards akane was the exact opposite giving him the connection that he craved rikka stayed on her computer when he woke up and pointed him to the bathroom then she whined before taking him to the hospital afterwards she told him that they were nobodies to each other finally she unceremoniously left him alone on his home akane did the exact opposite she was kind and nice she took him to the hospital willingly she told him that they were dating she tried to make a good mood before leaving him on his own
            enough with that shit what the fuck does alexis have to gain with giving akane a world she can freely reshape
  the only thing he seems really interested in is kaiju isnt it kind of weird that the only way akane can change the world is by making kaiju fuck it up and repairing it afterword i think he wants is akane to make a powerful enough kaiju to either take over the digital world for himself or the real one
  he needs feelings he has been actively sabotaging akane for a reason
what if they show up in the finale
  what if akane becomes a ssss sigma with boobs
  amemiya vs imaishi  director showdown  decisive battle
  thats what im expecting actually
someone released a rip of the original gridman that isnt just a screenrecording  
  does it have subs
  yes
  great time to redownload
is there a english translation of this series online
english community hates sd because not real gundam
  well i guess ill die is there any way to hire a translator theres about 6 years worth of comics and im not spending all my time learning moonrunes to translate all this
  speak for yourself everyone here loves the first sd gundam
  well hes not entirely wrong  just look at the reaction here when the new sd gundam series was announced during the 40th anniversary stream  or when people foamed at the mouth when fumina replaced her gm with a sd
i dont think ive seen much of any sd gundam comics like these or the ones that come with the kits translated  they seem fun
  the ones that come with the kits translated  wait those exist   also is there scans of those online
  those exist  yeah like the bb senshi and the mushas and stuff usually come with comics on the instructions  scans  i think dalongs instructions scans have some i know ive scanned a couple of mine ill try digging some up
super sudarso bros edition    power rangers legacy wars street fighter showdown short film       tommy vs evil tommy extended      beast morphers trailer      lightning collection trailer      boom studios comics   mighty morphin power rangers vol 1  latest volume   go go power rangers vol 1  latest volume   power rangers pink   power rangers aftershock   power rangers lost chronicles   justice league / power rangers          coming soon   power rangers soul of the dragon  preview         previous thread 
  i figured the christmas episode will involve those 2
seriously no beast morphers trailer after the final episode what are you doing nickelodeon
  not gonna lie looking at some of these new rangers has been motivating me to get back into my prime shape mirins left and right
sucks that the cast of the neo saban era are unironically based aside from one yet theyre wasted on a crappy production crew
  minus one    do tell
  micheal taber is kind of a whiny cunt
  he thinks hes too good to play adam devines stunt actor
  how
  he reeeeeeeeeeeeed about pr not getting him better acting roles hes also the reason why we didnt get a full on dino charge/ninja steel team up
disney brain reviewed ninja steel he tries to find some things to praise but thought it was a shit season saying that even overdrive was more ambitious  
  tfw i fapped to a fic of these two fucking once
  at least overdrive has flurious
  usually power rangers doesnt do much for careers minus the rpm cast and bosch
  exactly so i dont know what the fuck he was expecting also keith robinson is arguably the most successful pr alum he was in fucking dreamgirls
cant believe im saying this but i thought the xmas special was pretty damn good first off no vic and monty which automatically bumps it up a couple of points     it felt a bit like the zordon era to me the way it made use of old villains and rangers i wish there was more of that versus each season feeling like its inside a vacuum outside of teamups     it redeems the anniversary special for not giving us a sudarso brothers moment and considering how jam packed that episode was it was for the best to just give them an additional episode for fan service     sledges crew was also a pleasure to watch compared to the ninja steel villains though i dont understand why fury and curio werent in either episode sledge and co appeared     i was also surprised that it seemed to have some actual budget versus being a cheap clip show though there was still the clip show element but it was at least minimal i dont understand why it was necessary at all given the money the spent on other things would it have really broken the bank to film a couple of extra scenes to avoid needing that even if it was just characters sitting around bullshitting it would be preferable to watching scenes from past episodes     overall i think it was a surprisingly high note for the neosaban era to end on though that might just be because my expectations were in the gutter
so how likely is beast morphers gonna suck
  not to mentioned that it seems the rangers seem to keep their ninja steel star powers in the end
  same staff as ninja steel so pretty high
i wonder if power rangers would get daring again and put some zord carnage
    i wonder if the fury and curio suits arent in good enough condition anymore
  i enjoy sledge but i think that he comes off as a villain that the writers never know what hes supposed to be a threat or comedy relief it sort of reminds me of lothor who started off intense and ended that way but for most of the show came off as a doofus
  but he is an overdrive apologist so that doesnt mean anything
  as has been established fury and curio did a fusion dance when they made it into the main universe
  thats a possibility but i think the more likely scenario is that chip and co doesnt understand his own timeline and which versions of the characters should still be alive
supersonic/psycho green didnt have a helmet during the story  well thats stupid
  physical or digital copy
  i just read comments online about it  the power rangers wiki already has pictures of all the supersonic rangers right now  speaking of them trey wrote an entire story bible to them so they may come back if given the chance  
shes such a fucking bitch holy shit
truly the most realistic gundam girl
i think frau is the best girl
it feels like the writer didnt know what to do with her during the second half of the show  the feds shouldve stuck her in the strike rouge as a midlevel boss for kira to ramp up the dramawould have been way better than the druggies
  the feds shouldve stuck her in the strike rouge     would have required way too much setup to be done properly after 25 episodes of doing jack and shit
  this    still better than cagalli piloting it on her first run
  cagalli was shown to be both a guerilla fighter and able to pilot the sky grasper first she was shit at it but she was a shit strike pilot too    the most active flay ever got was shaking her boobs at the camera
  who even is that
  this is gundam where anyone can hop in a ms and become good after a battle or two
  op image is super off model then she looks like a 00 character cosplaying as flay
  indeed and the feds have enough unethical tricks to speed the process up
    have her beg the alliance to let her fight against the coordinators following kiras death    while she is initially kept in the armed services at alaska to keep up appearances azrael decides to have her added to the list of staff to be evacuated from alaska and for her to be experimented on using the newest variant of the gamma glipheptin drug to have her rapidly converted into a weapon capable of taking on coordinators    while she dos not participate in the invasion of orb she is deployed for actual combat during the victoria recapture operation using the newest model strike rouge in the alliances counter offensive efforts    she is eventually redeployed to dominion to serve as a pilot and body guard for azrael who ultimately ends up mentally abusing her despite this her fanatical hatred of coordinators and dependence on the gamma glipheptin drug keeps her loyal    upon finding out about kiras survival during the mendel incident she begins to mentally collapse at the delusion that kira betrayed her she works alongside the druggie pilots to attempt to destroy the freedom only to successfully retrieve an evacuation pod from the vesalius with the njammers data instead    it is later revealed that the modified gamma glipheptin in her system has led to a decay of her entire nervous system and that she ultimately is dying regardless of her continued use of the drug regardless she ultimately wishes to defeat kira on her on terms before she dies     realizing that she had a connection to the arcangel crew azreal has her modified with an explosive in her stomach to be detonated on his command    upon being defeated in a battle with cagalis m1 astray flay crashes her damaged strike rouge into the exposed hanger of the archangel where she meets sai one last time azreal desperate to deal a blow to the archangel detonates the bomb in flay just as she finally breaks down in sais arms killing both of them instantly
  she doesnt even like sai
  everything was tolerable except for those last two points what the fuck happened there
    based on the original script plans for seed    kira dies during his fight with rau  athrun is crippled for life and is saved by cagali  flay sneaks onto the archangel with a bomb strapped to herself and ultimately cripples the vessel while blowing sai to pieces    all of these ideas were ultimately thrown out however if anyone has the fukuda interview about it this scenario was definitely the original plan
tell me /m/ what are resources on the internet you guys like using ie wikias forums boorus etc when looking up /m/ related information /m/ itself doesnt count
so is this show just two assholes taking turns murdering the others guys harem
  jerid said the nword
  name
toss in a war crime every other episode and yeah
    he studies judo in the begining of the series  thought it was just pointless filler  he actually uses it later on
  kind of though jerrid gets the worst of it seriously the man gets shit on no matter what new ms or master he gets kamille comes and fucks it up
  you dont fuck with kamille
  jerid does kind of ask for it
  at least it wasnt surprising like amuro being an accomplished zero g fencer
  i am lieutenant quattro bajeena of the anti earth union group  i have come to you todayto say the nword
  quattro bajeena    four pussies
  maybe if jerid didnt come back for more each time it happened it would stop happening
    true jerrid does keep coming for more ass whoopings actually i think hes one of the worst rivals ive seen in terms of gundam usually long running rivals at least get a few good shots or victories sometimes but with jerrid its the complete opposite his mentors do better than him and other newtypes while he gets shat on in and out yet his superiors encourage him hes getting better when hes not
  his character development goes in complete opposition to kamilles the latter starts out as a hothead who matures eventually as a result of his experiences while jerid slips further into madness with each waifu that he loses
  youre kinda missing the point of jerid m8 hes supposed to be a shit rival since hes meant to show what kamille wouldve been like if he never learned to let go of his anger and realize theres a hck of a lot more important things at steakheh than fighting some dumb rando like come on dude it aint rocket science hehehe
  you see zeta is actually about men that fail to protect women and how they cope amuro and char both loses lalah kamille loses pretty much everyone except fa and jerid loses every woman he gets in contact with  amuro and kamille can cope with it mostly through the power of more puss while char and jerid cant
  
  waifu killing gundams 2jerrids electric boogloo      jerrid im your rival    kamille who
  no quattro dont say the nword
    its also one girl trying to get two chads to murder each other for her pussy and neither one of them really giving a fuck
    it was a 20 second establishing scene in ehat way can that possibly be filler        hes not though amuro has never fenced before and char thinks he can beat amuro because char himself can fence while amuro only has his newtype instincts telling him where char will strike and which char thinks wont be enough but amuro thinks will they literally say as much        nnani
  now that sounds like a girls name
  newtype
  but jerid actually does almost kill kamille in their first oneonone fight char had to bail him out
  you cant call a killing murder if the deceased was actively trying to kill the person that killed them thats self defense
  well it was his first battle as you said after that it was downhill from here
  basically this  soldiers / murderers
    but the aueg are practically terrorist they are the aggressors so anyone they kill is murder
  there is just a strict definition of murder that that doesnt apply to   i dont know how gas or lazer warcrimes fit into that but jerid fighting the military fighting a literal rebel faction ie anti earth union group is not murder
    i dont recall aeug carrying out any terrorist attacks againat civilians no dakar doesnt count since they didnt actually attack any civilians they only attacked or killed soldiers actively attacking them as far as i recall which isnt murder
  they didnt most of their time was running defending or attacking bases belonging to the titans hell titans caused more destruction then they did
  dont say it quattro  do not say the nword
  on a cripple
  any man that dresses like this has no right to call another man a girl
  theyre moreso reformists but the only time i can think of civilian causalities caused by their aggression is green noa 2    most civilian causalities were mainly done by the titans as the aggressors with aeug on the retreat or defense
  the titans caused those civilian casualties through their recklessness i legitimately doubt the aeug went into that colony wanting to kill civilians
    the aeug are moreso a guerilla militia than a terrorist group but that still makes them aggressors and murderers whether or not they intend to kill civilians  if i took some pals and shot up a military base it would still make me a killer no matter what moral cause i stood behind
    if you killed them when they couldnt fight back because of a lack of warning or that they were restrained in some way then yeah it might be murder when two military groups in military uniforms and military platforms come in to military conflict its not though
damn haman looks like that
  15 years old  that level of ass
did they
  yes pretty much yes and char its like 10 years old than she
  what is this expression trying to convey
  happiness  thats why char leaving fucked her up
that kamille girl is quite a looker im not surprised he left some pink haired chick with too much hairspray for her
  she just gave him a handjob and thought she did everything right but look at chars face only blatant disappointment is there  most probably shes an awful kisser too as judau was about to find out  no wonder she was ditched by both
is char a tits or an ass man
  based off of lalah haman and kamille hes clearly an ass man
  my fucking nigger
  mineva im doing something extremely wicked
what is hamans expression trying to convey here
    
    chars dissapointment  hamans smug glee  she just sucked his dick and suprise cumkissed him
yeah haman got a butt
you motherfuckers are straight thirsty
  is this a char
  i just started ovulating char if you knock me up right now we could have super newtype twins  no way fag
  at least theyre not gay thirsty
  its fuckin haman youd have to be gay not to
  what a shame that ep 1 of kuroinu was the only good one the rest are irredeemable trash and no one can refute it
    disappointment  explain i am genuinely curious
    the rest arent as good but theres still some good stuff in there the goddess in episode 4 being humbled and degraded in front of the public before begging for mortals to use her is good too for instance the execution isnt as good as the concept could be but its still good spank material
  fat lazy pregnant haman bitching at me to rub her swollen and gross feet after i just worked my newtype ass off and took out half a feddie fleet in my mobile suit is my fetish
  smug spacenoid girls  plz no
  pmsing haman deleting a whole fleet with hundreds of funnels
  why is the gerbera tetra there wouldnt a gelgoog/zaku ii be more appropriate
  well she had a cameo in 0083
  when its 2am and the only krispy kreme doughnuts in ireland is out of apple fritters
  haman dont you think this is overreacting just a tad   i want apple fritters
  god dammit you cheeky motherfucker
  yfw the colony drop looks like a giant space robot tit
reminder  char  is a pedo  has shit taste in girls  got beat up by a girl  was cucked by amuro yazan scirocco  was wrong about everything   doesnt like hamansama  is a weak ass new type  jobs all the time  judau  is the opposite of a pedo   has god tier taste in women  beats up people twice his size  is a chad and all the women in the series like him  grew up on the streets and was right about all the adults  made haman see the error of her ways in two seconds and likes haman  is among the strongest of new types  rarely jobs  there is a reason why he made her forget all about char
  gay stroke
    who let nagano into the gundams again
  why is the gerbera tetra there  she knows why
hey judau whos your least favorite country italy or france
  i think itd be israel
hey judau dont mind me
brrraaaaaappppppppppppppp
  imagine the pressure
  fucking perfect
  stay mad cuck aznable
haman would choose char over judau in an instant
  once you have a taste of a chad you never go back to betas like char
    i said this before bit rewatching this stuff i find it very hard to think as char as anything close to being cool he just comes across like someones douchey uncle who thinks everything they say is cool as fuck but really hes just a massive douche and everyone is waiting for him to fuck off so they can get back to actually talking about whatever
  that haman art is hilarious
  good haman make yourself comfortable  ill be there in a sec
    she acted more human and vulnerable around judau than she ever did around char discounting kitazunes fan fiction so i doubt that
are ryusei threads allowed on channel /m/ lets find out
were a channel is this tv
  slightly disappointed that there was not a lot of robutts in that book
    a cat robot is fine too
    as best girl as judy is shes not really ryuseis type
  i still miss that one artist who did the eyesearing dayglow neon sexy robot time pictures
i miss ratbat
  checked    has ryusei ever said anything about gynoids
  is this his
  i think he was asked why he didnt like the androids even though he said he likes robot girls and he replied theyre too small
    im gonna need a lot more eggs
  i didnt know vargsama posted on /m/
    you know just because you draw a but bulbous doesnt mean you drew it sexy

would have amuro tried to convince judau to stick with fhe feddies  would have judau become the second best uc pilot if he had been mentored by the best uc pilot ever  or would the pupil have surpassed the master
  would have amuro tried to convince judau to stick with fhe feddies  i wouldnt think so amuro understood what it meant to be tired of fighting if judau wanted to fuck off to jupiter in order to start over and make newtype babies with roux that was his own decision
  would have amuro tried to convince judau to stick with fhe feddies  no amuro wasnt in love with the feration either what with being stuck into house arrest for 7 years  would have judau become the second best uc pilot if he had been mentored by the best uc pilot ever  they really dont fight the same way amuro is a technician while judau relies on dakka mostly
    where the fuck is judaus hand in this pic
  bad photoshop is bad
  would have amuro tried to convince judau to stick with fhe feddies  hell fucking no amuro was under no illusions regarding how corrupt and rotten the federation could be
yea literally the only reason he joins londo bell at all according to chars counterattack is because he knows char is planning something and wants to stop it hed almost certainly have left after the events of the movie if hed survived going by that logic he has no reason to encourage anyone else to join since char was just a hunch and a personal rivalry
  you know where
  grabbing that ass
  would have amuro tried to convince judau to stick with fhe feddies  he wouldve asked but if judau refuse it he would understand because he is a bro tier pilot he believe not in the color of the federation but those few people within the feds that wanted to change for the future of mankind just like how he demonstrate in zeta when he ditch the feds to the karaba and when the threat of the titans were gone he went back to the federation to gave his life on stopping a mad man with mommy issue
its not fair bros what went wrong   press f to pay respects
  be glad it had more spotlight than seed at least
s
  the show resolved itself rather well    for fucks sake everybody is dead where could you ever go from there
  remember announcement for the announcement that will lead to the actual announcement     it will not end like this we will have the last laugh
  making ride go full hathaways flash on neo gjallarhorn it would be redundant seeing how theyve literally just announced the actual thing for adaption
now heres a big guess about what might have happened during the great calamity    the gundam frames the alayavijnana system relics of old but what did cause that war all those centuries ago why make such modifications and mobile suits      i know the answer might be a little crazy but hear me out    my guess for the true cause of the calamity a fragment of the devil gundam    a fragment that drifted to that dimension and sewed the seeds of destruction and by studying it they developed the gundam frames in an attempt to use itself against it it was indeed defeated but with the great cost of the moon      but if it was indeed a fragment of the devil gundam why is it there in the first place how was it defeated      and is it still alive in stasis for an unknown length    and here i go again with my ramblings
  go back to the past  calamity war bitches
no its right here
  s  i press s to shit on its grave laughing in joy
  saves ibo
  gotta terminate the scum good riddance    son dont start spreadin lies
  murderzuki will put a bullet in setsus flower
ogawa just confirmed were getting another visual in the future its being worked on right now  hype  
  here we see the elion family in its natural habitat orbitalbombarding children with a prohibited weapon without even running a falseflag first to offer a token justification  hes just dropping giant spears on them from orbit  dropping them like theyre going out of style  in front of witnesses and everything  this is the man whos in charge of gjallarhorn at the end of the series folks
  nah  press c to celebrate
  what went wrong  not enough jasley
s    but f to the mechanical designs
  s
  everybody is dead     3/4 of the cast are alive and kicking
  but what did cause that war all those centuries ago    economic tensions between earth blocs led to the creation of mobile armors which led to gjallarhorn taking over to keep everyone in line    this is all in the show already
the only people i know who enjoyed ibo were nongundam fans aka people who dont buy gunpla
  gaelio is alive thats all that matters
  only memegra mike august and guts died though i guess faggots died too but there are other faggot kids running around     gundam zeta started out with entirely new cast for fucks sake    personally as kind of person who dislikes gundam ibo i think itd be pretty interesting to see a new cast of characters who hate change tekkadan and chocolate man brought and blame it on rustal
  s    good riddance
    they also said it wouldnt get a second season either    oh wait
it is beyond any doubt this is the greatest most famous achievement of ibo
  shit writing
  inb4 s2 ends up worse than destiny
  what happened unless they came on stage and said fuck ibo it could get new shit at any time not every series gets new shit each year
  vidar is overrated as fuck yes even taking its screentime into account
i want a quality atra mascot costume going around doing stuff like that keroro
tfw rustal is a winner forever now
  what went wrong     the problem with ibo was that the series became increasingly tone deaf and didnt know what it wanted to be season 1 was a heroic underdog story where the hero always pulls ahead at the last second or is saved by a friend the mafia dudes are friendly supporters who understand the heroes plight and try to support them as a father figure gjallahorn is a treacherous villain group and notrelena is a magic speech princess who can stop wars with words   contrast with season 2 and you have a first couple of episodes of heroic returns barbatos plopping out of the sky and singlehandedly saving the day then some joint gjallahorn mission followed by a guerrilla war/vietnam grunt story followed by some sort of evangelionesque backstory to the gundams followed by the dumbest military plan in history to seize power somewhere in there is a gangster/mafia story     so what went wrong it was a season 2 sunrise production and those always suck because the producers want to do everything they possibly can with every possible thing
  should have realized the writings off when chryse ownership transfer at gunpoint is somehow legal binding dkr at least have them working on absolving it
  its not fair bros what went wrong  the entire last half of the second season thats what
  keep seething
best timeline
  it doesnt seem like he cared much about anything but good guys smash bad guys
the mars unions defence force is comprised of large battlegroups called legions    the smallest minimal unit is the squad made up of 8 combat mobile suits and 2 support mobile workers lead by a sargent one of the 8     a century comprised of 10 squads 80 mobile suits 20 mobile workers is the standard tactical unit a centurion leads the century assisted by a 1st lieutenant and a staff sargent     a cohort which is made from 6 centuries has 480 mobile suits and 120 mobile workers of the 6 centurians in the cohort the one with the most seniority would be designated as commander of the cohort with the other 5 under him     a legion is comprised of 10 cohorts cohorts ii to x are regular sized but the first cohort made up of 5 doublesized centuries 800 mobile suits 200 mobile workers     a group of 120 mobile suits is designated as the cavalry to recon and destroy enemies with shock action using sheer speed and brutality in all a total of 5242 mobile suits and 1280 mobile workers including the two personal use ms piloted by the tribune colonel and the legate brigadier general of the legion
  s
  oh but i have something to add to that    ma lucifel    the first mobile armor to become deranged my guess as with before was the devil gundam first infecting that and then the others
    greed divers    like this shit was any better
then next minute some drongo comes up with some shitty headcannon that post disaster is the distant far away successor to the after colony timeline futilely basing that fucking theory on the fact that all mobile suits disappeared after the end of ew not counting frozen teardrop and that the mobile armors were supposedly made to replace the lost tech of the ms 200 years after ew somehow causing the calamity war
  ibo is what happens when the technical designers give you a journal of fantastic drawings but the storywriters are brain dead    see also  five star stories
  obari designs in an au gundam where they cant use beams  holy shit that sounds awes  written by okada  what a phenomenal waste that was
  ibo was nothing more than the scrapped designs for greco though
  just because both have gyoubu as a designer
  they did run a false flag before remember not to mention shino fired dansleifs at them after that
  no they literally used scrapped designs
  proofs
  i really like the fact that they did all that and they won anyway rustal himself never even touched a gundam he didnt have to
  have you considered the saying everyone is a hero in their own eyes     sure the kids are heroes to their own guys but to the people and to the ruling bloc theyre dangerous rebels so they all die because cobbledtogethermobile suits calamity warera arcanotech and cando spirit is no match for a guy with more ships more men better strategic ability and fucking railguns
  calamity era technology which is shown to outperform absolutely everything in current production   characters that are constantly shown in a heroic light that succeed against all odds    this wasnt a jojo fight scene where you switch pov to the villain and see his thoughts and struggles against the main cast this was just an unceremonious collapse of all the tension built up prior to the bael unveiling
  muh different angle    i dont mind a bad ending where the protag dies but achieving this by dumbing down the characters at the last minute is dogshit    i am a tactical genius who worked my way from being a cocksleeve to the head of a ruling family on earth   oh no getting bael doesnt matter  i will rush the enemys entire fleet with a handful of soldiers for no reason at all  oh no i fucked up how could this have happened
  calamity era technology which is shown to outperform absolutely everything in current production    they had three suits three not counting bael the enemys fleet was large enough to surround their fleet and that was before the bad guys brought up the railguns mcgillis and his bumboy fisted hard but they could not fist them all
  hes actually like john brown the abolitionist who pulled off a raid on harpers ferry the guy didnt know what to do and lost momentum he also placed a lot of faith in the power of symbols he took george washingtons sword and some other stuff did this help him at all    absolutely no
  ibo reboot when
  why bother just make a new series with new staff
  i dont know much about burger history but harpers ferry is just an arms depot from what i read what mcgillis did in the show was the equivalent of taking control of the capital of the entire fucking planet and holding every other authority figure on earth hostage    it doesnt make sense for him to dive into space especially when he knew getting bael doesnt have the intended effect that he has envisioned in this case this actually makes him more retarded than john brown because at least he raided the arsenal so he can have weapons to arm his soldiers meanwhile mcgillis just took the same few battered soldiers he has with him to space without even bothering to search for upgrades and supplies before taking on the only thing standing in his way to dominate the entire gjallarhorn
  what mcgillis did in the show was the equivalent of taking control of the capital of the entire fucking planet and holding every other authority figure on earth hostage  taking lenins corpse hostage and demanding the ousting of putin and the revival of the soviet union
    so then what are these new designs about they keep posting on twitter    im not trying to be contrarian just trying to understand what is actually going on anymore especially thanks to the 40th live stream
  the equivalent of taking control of the capital of the entire fucking planet and holding every other authority figure on earth hostage  false equivalence what he did just taking over the main headquarters of nato where they become the sole military forces in that world and then he forced its chairmen to comply with his unreasonable demand which was failed and whats he gonna do kill them their soldier will just retaliate against chocoman which only increased the enemy he has to deal with aside from rustal
  okada taking control   s
    it was really stupid of him  but it was really stupid of him because thats what the writers made it   it was like if you watched a whole syndicated mystery series and they pulled the twist ending out of a hat   have you seen the movie clue with tim curry and theres like 8 different ending to the movie     it was like that but they picked the shittiest one that was the dumbest   mcgillis is stupid because the plot suddenly made him stupid and it was disappointing   everyone gets that mcgilliss plan was retarded and disappointing     the point is that mcgillis retarded and disappointing plan made the show retarded and disappointing
  the issue is that mcgillis is a complete fucking manchild inside but he can put up a good front before you realize exactly how crazy he is hes basically like dutch from rdr2 his one skill is looking confident and in control when in reality he has no plan    this feels a bit like a retcon because his plans actually work in all of season 1 and he appears to be a cunning and savvy operator for his big gambit to actually work and for it to accomplish jack shit feels really strange i mean he has no backup plan his sole plan is bow down before bael when they didnt go for that he had nothing left was he really thinking he could just sword everyone to death actually given that we see him carve his way through dozens of ships why not just get everyone to make a suicide run i assume that mika akihiro and mcgillis all working together could probably have destroyed the flagship
  yeah well this universes lenin comes with 2 supposedly unbreakable blades and some secret tech shit that never got expanded upon because the writers are fucking hacks    this corpse is also pretty fucking strong in the sense that mcgillis just dug it up and its able to fight other gundam frames that just has been recently renovated ie vidar kimaris      what he did just taking over the main headquarters of nato where they become the sole military forces in that world    how is this not good enough though nothing and nobody can threaten him on earth given his position and he would have a relatively easier time if he just reactivated the interplanetary defenses and put some of his forces to fortify the position    as for the old fucks who are unwilling to back down theres nothing they can do while being held hostage and mcgillis given time can slowly dismantle any opposing force they have given time      this feels a bit like a retcon because his plans actually work in all of season 1    thats the fucking point s1 wasnt the most wellwritten plot but at least it made sense everything went to shit when mcgillis past was revealed and when he finally seized bael the plot then did a 180 and tells us that he was a retarded manchild all along and this doesnt fit with his character that we have seen in s1    tldr mcgillis is retarded only because the writers needs him to be retarded otherwise they dont have a way to close the plot neatly
  what surprises me is that noone seemed to notice that mcgillis apparently perfect the av system i mean this is huge he could turn his entire army into the equivalent of psycho zakus    but noone does anything with that
  i get that everyone gets that   but do you get that the show was disappointing and retarded because they made everyone disappointing and retarded
  i honestly sort of liked the ending it was really unusual i kept expecting them to pull off some lastminute save like most other shows but no the space battle really was the end of it all and the rest was their increasingly desperate attempts to squirm out of trouble    i liked it but i see why a lot of people didnt
  i liked it but i see why a lot of people didnt  because it was complete fucking garbage where the smart and totally in charge adult suddenly put them on the defense spammed dainsleif ex machina and then had a mob hit squad kill the leader of the tekkadan
    i love the subtlety that each one of these designs has barbatos claws so you dont know which is which symbolically    really hope we get to see original paint schemes and colors for a change on them eventually    always wanted to see ride colors on a gundam design with the pale blue and yellow
tsukame success
  why wouldnt rustal put them on the defensive the man is used to commanding armies orga isnt tactically trained hes making it up as hes going on more tekkadan is really really small compared to mcgilliss forces who are in turn outnumbered by rustals men     remember noone actually likes tekkadan theyve thrown in with the losing end of a rebellion every door is closed to them and the pressure is on its not a particularly romantic way to end a series but its plausible
  this for gods sake
  do you think klan members are willing to be turned into a nigger just to gain a little bit of strength
  why wouldnt rustal put them on the defensive  why would a monkey throw a severed arm more accurately than any sniper in the series why would someone use illegal weapons in mass shot across the atmosphere and not be seen by anyone why would a man who was collected and calculating the whole time suddenly become a retard who flew around thinking he had a magic suit why are you defending a show that only literal retards would find structurally sound
  i just felt cheated out of everything there was a lot of potential built up before the bael reveal and it all just went nowhere to service a predetermined ending the producers wanted to bring about somehow i wouldve been cool with a deserved downer ending and they had a few they couldve brought around without the specific twist they chose to go with     consider we had these plot points going on    a pseudosentient barbatos that mika had a positive relationship with    a constantly mentioned agnika who makes no appearance but piloted the bael couldve possibly overtaken mcgilliss mind in contrast to mika or rejected him in contrast to mika     mobile armor giant self sustaining mobile suits that caused the calamity bael couldve been some sort of mobile armor control unit that mcgillis couldve plugged his body into probably getting trapped inside of it this wouldve served well with mcgilliss constant talk about power     consider this  mcgillis doesnt betray any of his friends instead he just uses the halfmartian as a guinea pig to perfect the surgery  mcgillis undergoes the surgery and then sneaks into bael and then demands publicly that he be accepted as the new agnika as per the written law   he uses this publicity to promise a new uncorrupt gjallarhorn   the counsel then can use him as positive publicity at the very least they have to follow the law and make him a puppet leader of some sort     instead   kill friends to get political promotion friends betray him later on   political promotion unseats his pedophile dad who then betrays him later on  his unwarranted promotion puts the counsel on the defensive and they betray him later on  sides with tekkadan and rubs them thoroughly into all his shit and they die  dies having a giant robot fight with a friend he never had to kill  against an army he never had to fight  in a mobile suit he couldve picked up anytime
  av is repeatedly said to be taboo in the series illegal in the world mechanics books if mcgillis unveiled his perfect av it would lessen his support base as it is something unspeakable to them and he cultivated his support withing gjallarhorn by railing against corruption
    mcgillis betrayed gaelio his father and gjallarhorn itself long before they ever retaliated in kind back at him    he created far too many enemies to kill him during a period of time where he should have been creating allies to help him
  iok bless
  best part
  even sd gundam a series basic gundam fans ignored gets a new series    greatest timeline
  best timeline  wanting more reconguista trash
  hahahahahahahah
  f  i dont know why but i was in tears through like the entire last 4 episodes when i finished i just curled up into a ball and cried harder
  this would be genuinely baller they really fucked up by not giving us more of the mobile armor in season 2 a show with a conflict against them as the focus would be fresh not just for ibo but for the franchise as a whole      also i heard they were supposed to release a new ibo related visual soon i wouldnt give up just yet
  though  you ended that sentence like you said something contrary    scrapped designs can still be fantastic      you wont find any because it isnt true
  well just wait until the steel moon manga the one with astaroth finally ends then they can make a oneoff movie sequel featuring the children of the main and side stories uniting against a crazed almiria seriously if they want to give us more post disaster they have to finish that side story manga
  why arent they wearing any pants
  steel moon already abruptly ended they never even showed the main antagonist gundam that killed the mcs family
  god help us if the writers of said sequel try and make mars the space futuristic rome simply because they needed a contrast to gjallarhorns space medieval aesthetic for fucks sake
  so i remember coming across some some pictures of that bitch before i actally decided to watch ibo needles to say i was shocked to find out that wasnt an effeminate guy
  you watch your mouth carta issue is an absolute wife
jeez whats next akatsuki becoming the next masked char clone
  who is herro looking at i cant tell
  far from dead anon last event said there are multiple ibo projects coming theres a new event in january and ogawa said he is gonna release a new key visual very soon also a new cd drama is coming i just wish sunrise could just say what the fuck they are making why so much secrecy
  did it predicted trump visionary
    camille
  found the retard
  its just all about the hype but the series is dead already its been their tactics since season 1
  cute
  yes u are
  yeah i can see some new subproducts like a manga novels and some other low risk shit to still selling toys but not another series its time to move to something else technically the subfranchise is dead
  greco getting a movie    ibo fags getting excited over a drawing    ibo fags on suicide watch lmao
  ibo got teasers for sequel while greco fags just get the same old show made watchable we hope
  teasers for sequel that will never air
  very sure thats how our wait for the movie started we were teased picture after picture of kira with his white zaft uniform with a white/black strike freedom and look where we are now
  almiria is the next char
  i miss those times
  she end crazy because ptsd in ibo events  ridhle goes full terrorist    almiria counter attack when
  setsuna f seiayylmao
  seed gets teased for years  nothing happens except hd remasters  wing gets teased for years  frozen teardrop never animated enjoy your manga retelling of w  oo gets teased for years  lol r4 design for newtype magazine fanservice and stage show  ibo gets teased  enjoy getting nothing for a decade only to have it end up being an 8k remaster with a couple msvs and some drawing for a digital press magazine ibo fags insisted the 40th would be where season 3 was announced and said everyone from japan was wrong when they were saying ibo is dead and nothing is happening
  i just wanna know what happens with hitlerkun
so what happens to mars union do they maintain and become a peaceful power in their own right or does pirate attacks and multiple failed rebel uprisings on the red planet turn it into a militaristic nationalist republic with roman styling of course
  the mechanics books mention that teiwaz is selling hekija to the mars union and may be eyeing up taking over security duties from gjallarhorn so theyre profiting nicely after they put kudelia in office
  so in what 25 years or so after the epilogue mars is gonna have some sort of next generation hekija
  the hekija is teiwazs state of the art ms built to deal with the growing threat of avequipped human debris along teiwazs trade routes it has high specs and is easy enough for anyone to use shidens comparatively were cheap and weaker than s1 mobile suits     i think its more interesting that the mafia plans to become the cops guess thats one way to protect your operations
  mars union becomes an economic power  they need an independent military force to protect from pirates and potential rebel groups on mars  organise the armed forces based on roman military structure  because writers wanted excuse to have romans in contrast to gjallarhorn knights
  rides counterattack/akatsukis flash except now akatsuki is in his late 20s as a military career officer and ride is the mysterious benefactor who provides him with the technology aided by almiria
  stop with the fucking roman meme already
  if you thought that was bad some fag also wanted a martian ms squad to land at horsell common surrey england
  i think its more interesting that the mafia plans to become the cops guess thats one way to protect your operations  also would put them in a great position for extortion
  extorting the union or the pirates seriously this all sounds like kudelia getting the short end
  i was thinking union but both sounds better
    teiwaz may end up in secret control of mars while still being in a good relationship with gjallarhorn the ironing is delicious
  white/black strike freedom  i need to see this
  teiwaz under ride one day secretly helping helping the martian government by supplying them with adavnced tech or just getting rich off the extortion money
  why would ride be involved
mcgillis was right
  ride needs to build up resources necessary to carry out his revenge fantasy only to realise that it may not be the best path of action and instead mellows out into turning a space mafia into an even stronger megacorporation based on jupiter with some backing from almiria who has never gotten over the death of her husband and secretly wants to guide ride back to his original revenge plot
  no vidar is cooler than bael
  mfw believed mcgillis master plan with his tekkadan alliance was to pit them against rustal with him as the only one that would come out on top  boy did he swallow the bluepill between seasons
  i still believe the seed movie will come  ill never give up on it
s
  this shit infuriated me the biggest red flag of terrible writing is that this show just straightup ignores all the rules of the setting for no reason other than the writer says so another is being able to pilot bael being a big deal then having everyone just ignore it for no reason
  im getting new sd gundam and ibo gets nothing im pretty happy
  didnt you get like 3 spin offs
  new ibo was announced before any of these 40th anaveraries were   sorry friendo you might get your kids show first but were going to get a movie or another 25 episodes
  sure thing famalam right after the seed movie
  was the 00 one the stage play
  i totally forgot about that  i have no idea i dont even know what a stage play is   one click bait im watching is saying stageplay and spin off
  stage play is basically musical theatre
  sure anon sure  and well just gonna laugh at you for the next decade every time youll bring it up
    he had no plan to begin with though only outrage that gjallarhorn allowed his childhood to happen and that it didnt meet his expectations as he grew up    the only difference between season 1 and season 2 mcgillis is he was just more successful at being a delusional renegade asshole in the first season    he still set up everything that was coming back to kill him in the second season by getting closer to tekkadan and trying to kill gaelio and everyone who would have actually supported him
  dont count
  another is being able to pilot bael being a big deal then having everyone just ignore it for no reason  they ignored it because it was a 300 year old myth
  ibo was so bad
  this is what ibofags actually believe  lmao
    it wuld be nice if instead of fighting they just gave each other a nice hug    not that it would stop setsuna from hugging him    unfortunately
  see 
  this plot was dumb   this plot wasnt written ahead of time  the producer and the watcher both dont know where the plot is going to go  mcgillis was always an idiot isnt true its only true in the end in service for the downer ending   before the bael reveal you were teased with giant angel super gundams  before the bael reveal youre shown mcgillis is a man obsessed with power  youre shown giant super powerful selfsustaining evangelionesque kaiju machines    mcgilliss plan revolved entirely around what bael was  mcgilliss character revolved entirely around what bael was   if bael was anything besides the dumbest legal loophole ever written then mcgillis isnt an idiot   if bael actually had any power whats so ever then mcgillis isnt an idiot
  or an animated adaption of gekkou    from what i recall most of its story is totally unrelated to ibos main story
  see also  five star stories    t retard who has never read a page of fss
  mcgillis was always an idiot isnt true its only true in the end in service for the downer ending  his mo in s1 one was he backed a bunch of child soldiers to fuck up his own organization and didnt think he would get caught    bael was a symbol of absolute power but he didnt rely on it until after he realized that rustal knew he was a traitor and had proof he tried to murder his best friend
  bael was his primary goal since childhood
  you were infuriated because you autistically took things characters said as rules of the setting and not just what a specific person thought at a given time    stop watching shows as if theyre documentaries designed to teach you facts about some real place
  my real question is who the fuck is buying any of rustals shit by the final battle everyone who matters knows that iok set the turbines up and tried to massacre them with a prohibited weapon rustal did a deal to protect him because hes rustals idiot flunkie everyone should by this point realize that arianrhod set up the dort idiots to get slaughtered before they got sugoid and had to stop that one even made the news from earth at least all the way to mars and nobody in the final battle could possibly fail to understand that rustal clearly falseflagged hard to justify wiping out mcgilliss fleet based on the lack of return fire and the fact that it doesnt seem like any of mackys forces were ever important enough to maintain a standing force of dainsleif grazes and he subsequently didnt even do anything to justify the orbital bombardment of tekkadan he just relied on vague implication and the fact that nobody was left to stick up for them    id point out that someone knew where the proverbial bodies were buried but at this point every single character ever shown on screen who survived knows that rustal is a serial war criminal and seems to just be okay with that for reasons right up to and including kudelia whose boyfriend rustal made it a special point to have slaughtered
  theres a new gundam ibo project no specifics more details during a spring 2019 event to celebrate ibo airing anniversary    the 40th livestream didnt really show anything besides the new uc projects hathaway build divers project already expected a sd series and a greco compilation movie the posters were simply art and doesnt mean crossover series
  give it up already tokyosaurus
  he has either has them in his pocket or they are powerless to stop him hes set fucking invincible
so something occurred to me yesterday thats been bothering me ever since i was disappointed the 40th anniversary special didnt have any new ibo info and to be honest the rest of the news was pretty bland except for the prospect of the kits from hathaways flash and the dearth of ibo news besides those keyframes has been really confusing especially with the news about a build divers sequel and no sketches about that at all    then it hit me    what if theyve been previewing the new build divers series this whole time    what if the notbarbatos we keep seeing looks that way because its a custom build kit     the last episode of divers ended with them going to a new server that just happened to be named after the intergalactic comm network in ibo i realize this is probably all just a coincidence but i cant help wonder     is the ibo sequel actually just the new server setting for build divers are we past the point where they can use ibo ms in the show
  that would be far better than ibo obari directing a build series with those suit designs and just animating cool fights would be the tits
fucking ibo  if only the serires wasnt about retarded space rats but rather gundams fighting ma
    mcgillis was always an idiot isnt true    thats why he proceeded to kill anyone politically viable in his own force who could have been useful to him in the future even those closest to him who believed/trusted in him that gjallarhorn had to be changed drastically and in cartas case even one who loved him    thats also why he chose to fund/raise tekkaden as patsy revolutionaries in his stead using kudelia as a cautionary warning story for the gjallarhorn militarys modern corruption    the smartest thing he ever did in the first season was allow todo to live to use as a liaison between himself and tekkadan    he could have easily allowed gaelio and carta to live putting further power in his own corner of the seven stars pie chart percentage could have easily spared ein to further placate gaelio could have easily exposed henri fleurs and iznario since he knew about their collusion from the beginning could have easily removed iznario from power completely knowing the knowledge he did    he has more in common with the nut job from the second season than you think
  bbut he looks cool intelligent with a wicked sense of humor like me when hes doing it so he should had get a pass and getting away with it
  dont lose hope iboanon
  if this happens i will piss myself laughing
  last episode also had a bunch of ibo refrences in the bar scene
good riddance
  the two protagonists defeated the villains and got a happy ending together even if one of them is now in a wheelchair good ending to me
  thats no saint seiya boy no saint seiya  besides space guts and casca with her band of the waifus died because aurga duo and mcretard fucked everybody over
there are people in this thread that are excited for a potential ibo movie    they fucking had 50 episodes and didnt do shit with them another hour and a a half wont be able to fix anything  the story they wanted to tell is over anybody with any common sense wouldnt want to touch it
  hype up mcgillis as a 4d chess mastermind willing to do anything to achieve his goals in s1  in s2 his plan is entirely based on the belief that the powers that be will bend to his will over some shitty technicality established hundreds of years ago   i thought that the good guys dying in the end was fitting for ibo but i wish it was a little more reasonable it felt like mcgillis went full retard at the end for the sake of the plot there could have been better ways to make him and tekkedan lose
  i totally forgot all about mikas backstory is there an explanation for his literal autism/sociopathy like does he have a reason for being that retarded setsuna murdered his parents when he was a kid so that made sense but i dont remember any kind of backstory like that for murder midget
  mika has been following orga around for most of his life or from his pov his entire life since murdering that dude in the alley orga eventually led him into a life of death of violence which mika ended up liking a lot as such mika never really had much of a childhood and treated his situation as normal it was all he knew and in the end preferred being a fighter doing what he was good at and liked doing than an uncertain future in a world he felt he had no place in
  maybe tekkadan shouldnt have pissed off the rest of teiwaz with their constant fuckups then because its clear mcmurdo blamed the loss of the mine on them
  you make it sound like it was all her fault there was plenty of people involved in the shows story like the other writers and director
  the show would have been more entertaining if it was fulon nagai edge instead of being half okada melodrama and half nagai edge
  you make it sound like it was all her fault  its almost like anyone whos watched a few of her shows knows her particular style of garbage and that she was the lead writer
  is obari in china
  ok keep being braindead
  stop blaming the lead writer who literally had the biggest job in writing the story and who has never written a good original story in her life  other people worked on the series in less important capacities  i should have known better than to reply to an esl retard in the first place
    i genuinely enjoyed this take on garma actually getting his revenge on char and surviving the experience    not to mention garma actually becoming the true char clone of this story was bizarrely refreshing and enjoyable it was like watching someone you cant possibly respect expect much out of but failure or believe in remotely reinvent himself for his character arc    why couldnt we have seen more from vidar though i still love that design
  i hope mikazuki is next 2nd char after almeria in spin off
  probably because its very difficult to draw
  make a new war with a new cast jojo style
  it would be fucking hilarious to have adult akatsuki as the protagonist for the first half have him apparently killed off in ms combat against an enemy gundam with specifications on steroids then spend several episodes third quarter focusing on other characters and the war and then reveal a mysterious masked man as in fully covered by helmet and mask not just mask covering the eyes piloting a red gundam thats three times faster than the other gundams armed with a super napalm bazooka 10 rockets per mag 4 extra mags stored a 120mm coilgun and two high frequency swords for extra cutting power
  this we need a more extravagant series
speaking of ibo anyone know where i can find the manga none of the normal sites i use have it
i missed fumitan
  source
  in s2 some kid hug fumitan instead atra
armored core is japanese mech things  why foreigners love it
customization mostly from what ive gathered 4 especially
  4s customization is arguably the worst as all the designs clash without getting really creative with decals to hide some of the really bad stuff 5th gen suffers a similar issue but some te stuff is blocky enough to blend in with ke and ce defense parts 3 damage types were a mistake
  iirc as long as you didnt pick an ugly chest you looked fine in 5
  thats the problem to not get melted by even a weak pmg you pretty much have to run a te core or just dodge constantly te cores look super bloated on a lot of midweight legs except the thicc ones and those move really slowly on top of that you want to run ce arms most of the time for firing stability and those boxy shoulders dont mesh with the torso
  i liked the games especcially back in the day wonky controls though imo never liked em fun game though despite that
  you can remap to something more usable still wonky but not as wonky
  te legsce corece headke core looks fine and gives you plenty of wiggle room when it comes to the defense tree only problem i have with it is that i dont really care for many of the ce heads
  because western mecha sucks
  how come from never let us just change how pieces looked while they kept the stats thatd be great and when v/vd came out i had the idea of different weight classes for body parts following the te/ke/ex formula but the looked the same
  you listed core twice and no arms also te legs are fat shits and cant jump for shit
  shit my bad its been awhile since ive played vd pretty sure i used ke arms on my set up it couldnt jump all that well but was pretty fast and had good en capacity
  wwhere do you think you are
 starship troopers is american mech things   why foreigners love it     disney is american animation things   why foreigners love it     star wars is american scifi things   why foreigners love it
  isnt star wars nowadays dead outside of the west though
  pretty much and so is the mecha aspect of it as a result star wars needs a swift burial for everyones sake
  
  why cant you speak english
  theres one cookie cutter build that 90 of the japanese playerbase ran that look barely okay
     the last numbered film only made a billion dollars   obviously noone cares and its time to put it to bed because a spinoff that was in production trouble since almost the start and that had bad word of mouth before it even came out failed to make its budget    i dont even like the new films but thats a silly attitude some people still like it for whatever reason so let them frankly i still have the xwing books and games along with knights of the old republic and so on if i want some star wars
  this is fuckin with me bad    but i can see the appeal
  star wars is pretty dead inside the west after tlj
    its more western approach than eastern acs are more realistic at least ps1 and ps2 era than your typical anime giant robot and overall looks are more western too again mostly apply to ps1 and ps2 games 4 and 5 are more eastern especially with absurd quickboosting that would surely kill pilot due to sheer force
  your typical anime giant robot and overall looks are more western too again mostly apply to ps1 and ps2 games 4 and 5 are more eastern  is this a joke ac13 are typical kawamori robots while ac4 has a bunch of atypical designs and vacs are the most western looking acs so far
  ac1 and 2 were the games that insects that fired literal missiles from their mouth acs appeal to the west is just that its a good franchise and not some vague concept like realism
    the shapes are much less humanoid than 99 of mobile suit desings actual combat capacities nonwithstanding theyre also remarkably smaller  they do have some realistic components that are missing from other franchises but pale in comparison to patlabor votoms and the likes
  honestly the claw grip is something i got used to with both ps2 and psp action games its really not that bad but claw is thumb on stick index on pad middle on shoulders
  4 has the best combat
why the kotobukiya kits always out of stock
  because armored core is dead    and i keep buying them all
its kind of the same deal with metal gear solid or even votoms where despite being blatantly japanese the games also feel rather western in terms of atmosphere and looks
  always out of stock  anon most of the ac kits have had rereleases this year the fact that youve somehow missed the august september october and november releases all of which have had reserves opened since like april and may is entirely your fault
  patlabor is pretty humanoid at least police and military labors    also while 4/fa was the fastest it did have some more interesting body shapes like typelahire and sobrero and even the covergirl aaliyah looked like some jetengine hybrid rather than normal humanoid robot
  you mean bestgirl aaliyah
is it alright to start on the 3rd one
  yeah the difficulty spike isnt so bad but beware of single analog controls on the ps2 version
  i still wish lr had a legit way to get opi but only after something ridiculous like 100 completion or sranking all missions  and of course autoban it in multiplayer
  the same could be asked of all anime or japanese videogames
you get a jeeg and you get a jeeg    everybody gets a jeeg    
  didnt he drew the heman comic for image
  not sure i do know hes contributed to a ton of transformers concepts and designs for combiner wars titans return and power of the primes    he even did an entire promotional comic for the titans return portion
  anyone got a story translation i dont speak pasta
when everyone is jeegs no on will be
is this some new kind of toyline promotion id love combining super robot figures with mixand match parts for new modes and combinations
thoughts im on episode 4
  i think i need to go back and finish it i started it shortly before i got a new job with a long commute so i ended up dropping it 1/4 of the way through and havent got around to getting back to it
one of the best tv mecha animes of the 80s atleast in the top ten
  thoroughly inconsistent the art writing animation theyre all all over the place the only things that are really nailed down are saras eyes being too big and the cockpits having an appropriate amount of buttons and knobs when its good its quite good when its bad its frustratingly stupid im glad i watched it but i would definitely not do it again    yatte yaruze and its associated music is pretty satisfying though
  make certain youre posting your thread on the right board next time op you dumb crossboarding shit
  ill spoil tag it just in case but the transformation sequence of the dancouga is the most fucking retarded shit ever the cougar and the panther only make the fucking feet and whats even the point of the fucking eagle the stupid mammoth already has a fucking head the eagle head just sits on top of it looking exactly the same what the fuck other than that the show is pretty entertaining
  theres a reason people say its just big moth putting on shoes and a hat
  i guess im one of those people now
  not bad ignoring the nonending the ovas are well worth the wait amazing stuff
  yeah the transformation definitely feels like the studio trying to make the best out of a shitty toy gimmick having a humanoid vehicle and animal form for each component is cool but it feels like your average sentai robot or brave combiner is missing two seperate components because they just welded them onto the chest portion
  wow anon im so glad you were here to tell me that i never would have known my mistake if not for your incredible insight    please take my shotgun as a token of my appreciation and blow your brains out with it
  i dropped it at episode 9 not quite bad but seemed really mediocre in everything but animation and mecha design and even that was inconsistent ill maybe get back to it one day
  long commute  theres your space to watch animu anon
  probably one of my top favorite super robot shows in the /m/ genre give it an 85 or 9/10
  forget animation wise and keep going noob i kinda did the same thing with tekkaman blade just how bad the animation was and how slow it got in the beginning episodes but eventually things got a whole lot much better the more i continue
ai yo faraway
  i also dropped tekkaman blade around episode 9 for the same reasons i dropped dancougar funny enough part of me wants to have seen every 80s and 90s /m/ show but there are still other things to try out before going back to something that dull for that long
  what are other best 80s mech shows i love the eras aesthetic but havent seen or know about many of them
i really really like dancouga as a show overall its alright but there are some really great moments and episodes about     god bless dancouga is fantastic  definitely worth watching the show to get to imo ive heard bad things about blazing epilogue but havent watched it yet
  lots of neat ideas restrained by shoestring budget and weird decisions it definitely tries a lot harder than anything in the franchise that follows it but still never manages to reach the level of good as a whole i dont even like god bless        my favorites from the 80s are bryger votoms xabungle and bismark all very different but if youre in it for the visuals bismark easily looks the best out of all of them votoms however has the better aesthetic
  to amplify the beastly power of the 4 pilots
  but dancouga doesnt really get better
what was the 3rd generals specialty that makes him the most terrifying one
  not really but they do at least manage to actually scrape together the money to do the transformation stock footage in something other than goddamn lineart
  tekkaman is more of a slow burn compare to what ive seen from dancouga so far the only issue that i feel is about show itself is that its the same grunts and enemy ships in every episode so far
  i unironically adore dancougas stupidly lopsided combination
welcome to the salty spitoon /m/ how tough are ya
at least post /m/emes you tourist fuck
  im so tough that i broke the three days rule
  not tough enough melonhead
  i jacked off to mineva zabi
  im so tough i watched all of end of evangelion    so    without having seen neon genesis evangelion first
  i watched the entirety of gundam seed  yeah so  dubbed
  i pilot a blue mobile suit  its no zaku
  did you quote stinky hat to kira
whos your favorite kroger brand robot
remember no shiny gundams or zeeks suits only feddie grunt suits
basic feddie grunt suit  gm custom    yeah and high mobility gelgoog was a basic zeon grunt
  only feddie grunt suits  k
best jegan
  sucks the pilot in that lost should have stayed to make unicorn enjoyable
    he died right any side material/gunpla fluff touch on who he was
    there was more than one stark jegan in the story gundam wiki claims the one that was killed by marida was a veteran who took part during the conflict of chars counterattack    but really stark jegan is absolutely not basic feddie grunt suit its a fecking rare jegan variant that has addon parts for enhanced firepower and mobility we should be posting stuff like the gm kai which gets shit on in 0083 like crazy
  all these gm variants really devalues the importance of the gm as well as themselves
  the type c is kind of justified as a postwar upgrade like the iis would later become  actually now i think about it i disagree entirely with your statement of course thered be little regional variants and upgrades to what is essentially the same unit in a gigantic extraglobal war
i really like the jsaviour it feels like a really well upgraded gm series
  all the variants wouldve been justified if they didnt serve to make zeon ms look strong by jobbing an ordinary gm wouldve sufficed  then theres the cold climate that jobs extra hard by getting hol horsed
  extra clarification before the ovas and side stories the feds just cranking out one general purpose mp suit gave them a distinct methodology compared to zeons overspecialization retconning that made the ef just as wasteful or worse especially when it comes to aqua ms
  oh hello fellow
  especially when it comes to aqua ms  so true they never even tried to make better ones they were using aqua gms well into unicorn and those things were garbage in the oyw they actually had better ones in captured zeon ms
i like jim
  out of the way good grunt suits coming through
  pale rider  get that shit out of here youre just a gundam masquerading as a gm
  imagine gm atlas
  i love the space variant those shelfthrusters are sex
didnt we just have this thread
its a gm quel i swear
  tell me about the gustav karl  why is it so thicc
  it kinda was in igloo at least
  i still cant find why the new gustav is so thicc the original lineart is arguably thinner
  wrong pic
  i thought that was him sucks they killed him off he could have been the mc than banana or at least a side character and not crybaby riddhe
  arguably  no thats indisputably thinner however the redesign is farsuperior same with the messer redesign honestly i hope they cleanup the xi / penelope too and get rid of those ridiculous tiddyharpoons
gentle reminder that javelins are nearly 30 years old at the time of victory and are still good enough to kill zanscare scum
  bahzammu
ya know only three titans mobile suits are ever seen onscreen with a unifying color scheme gundam mk ii barzam and byarlant considering the titans status as a specialforces military branch youd think theyd stick to a color scheme which denotes their unique status
  there is a fanfic out there i read where said stark jegan pilot joins the na during unicorn
  fan fics cannot satisfy me on what could have been he would have bring more interesting fights if he survived agaiandt marida and became a constant rival to her new type abilities as he did pretty good same i thought of for bright and his new tri stars
  elgoog was a basic zeon grunt  it was for the zeon marines
  where are these fics hiding whenever i look its mostly ibo and wing
  gundam uc section but that place is a graveyard of good fics the last time it was updated was months ago
  only feddie grunt suits    okay
  gm quel too
  i remember seeing a marasai and gablethey in titans colors in a lineart thread
  one references a fic about mineva taking after haman in unicorn  mfw its been wiped off the web
  wouldnt the barrel bend from the weight of the receiver
  higher res for ya
  quel and the ttt suits like hazel hizack etc too
  the thing is with the gm variants they almost certainly have intercompatible internals try fixing a dom with zaku parts and you get shit
  i said onscreen    only the gm quel eventually showed up in 0083
jesta is besta
  jesta  basic   grunt
  to be fair jamitov is a spacenoid supremacist so he probably ordered titans hizacks to be painted green to fill his secret zeonboner
nemo has got no love in the 11 years i have been on 4channel
  agreed its a good kit to kitbash like some hs wings
  it falls into the trap of being caught between two popular units the gm and the gm sniper ii   its the autistic little brother of two chads
these poor brave bastards envied the dead
  if enough additional stress were put on it sure but the barrel is the strongest part of a gun     that carry technique is also the standard for skeet shooters carrying shotguns although they carry them breechopen
how do you do fellow jims
isnt it swell to have our souls weighed down by gravity my fellow gee em pilots
  something seems fishy about you soldier    remove your faceplate now this order carries the full weight of the earth federation assembly committee of citizens concerned of zeon activity failure to comply will strip yourself of all rights you have 5 seconds to comply 5
  i wonder whats going through the gms pilot when thats happening  more than a bullet
  pilot boy does this monday suck no payday a divorce and now zeek raid why the fuck am i here anyways    i dont know why but i like that the ms during that little raid didnt just simmotanously explode like they usually do from a few hits
  does a sniper custom count or not
  i want to fly a core fighter one day
  truff
  this is the day where i get a kill with my head vulcans
hey would you look at that some plot
zamigo betrayed him    welp that early plot reveal went fucking nowhere
i stopped at episode 30 is this show still crap
  yes
  so did overtime ever say they were using patranger stills as a gag or to show their cop loving tendencies
  these elitist subbers are trying to besmirch the good name of the lupinrangers
  just jealous i bet i mean they are those thieves everyone has been talking about
  shinkenanon likes the cops more than the thieves believe me when i say i tried to submit lupin stills that said at this point i wished the pats had more focus
is this the wrong costume like one of those from stage shows or something it looks way cheaper than usual
  i hear ya the clear upgrades for the patrangers just getting tossed at the lupins has been pretty rough to see at times i just wish they had done all of the ranger pair episodes before the end game we are still missing  umika/keiichiro  touma/keiichiro  kairi/sakuya    i did love kairi mentioning how much it sucks to be caught out of thief gear i wish it was a bit more than a one liner though
  umika/keiichiro  wasnt that the episode with the girl with the record who like keichero and umika helped keichero out of the dream world
  considering destra saw action and was around pyrotechnics its not unlikely for that to be the stunt suit assuming theyre using one for stunts and one for closeups
  ack yep forgot that one
  i did love kairi mentioning how much it sucks to be caught out of thief gear i wish it was a bit more than a one liner though  it was a reference to the summer film which is the exact same plot as todays episode to which i am still confused as to why did they reuse it
  where do you rate the show
  i am laughing way to hard at this
was that necessary kairi
  kairi/sakuya    it would have just been kairi bullying sakuya the whole time but sakuya is too stupid to realize it
  yes
  too late for trying to make me give a shit about the ganglers they are by far the worst villains in sentai so far tame as fuck barely a menace
  first time in the whole show that hes done something awesome
  next episode is the begining of the final battle and i dont feel anything there was no progression at all
that was a pretty decent episode but it absolutely belonged in the early20s      good lighting and closeups are not kind to that suit
  nobody watch sentai anymore and the show is still running for contractual obligations with bandai why would toei spend money in the show
  that was a pretty decent episode but it absolutely belonged in the early20s    exactly its bizarre to see this in the late 40s      how true is that
  sentai is so unpopular these days that toei isnt allowed to produce it anymore lupinrangers producer is a tv asahi guy
  didnt they also get involved in kamen riders production
  its ok lots of wasted potential and unnecessary filler it really felt like they just wanted to sell the toys and be done with it in fact if you just watch the debut episodes for each toy you get a more complete story
  its what happens when you try to sell a team show thats just the almighty reds glory parade kids dont care about it because they all want to be the one who wins and that can only be red
  i havent heard about it but rider still seems to be solid in its demographic taking in consideration ratings have been declining in general during the last couple of years its still a shadow of its former self though
  the last time sentai got a rating bump even if it was a small one was ninninger and the entire season consisted on shitting over the red
  ss and pr have the same problem where nothing happens for long stretches of time then we quickly wrap up in the last handful of episodes i have no idea who decides to write these shows like this but clearly them dipping hard in ratings shows this writing style isnt working
  i dont think selfcontained adventures are really the problem but the lack of interest from the staff it doesnt help bandai is the owner de facto of the franchise and it forbid any deviation from the formula and when they deviated they never compromise and the product is halfassed fail and then bandai insist with the conservadurism at the end bandai only care about the toys the show is just a baggage for having a toy line
  for real ninnin had such terrible mecha concepts yet they had the balls to start out with the ultrasuperior red as buildup for the later freeforall competition toywise red still had the edge not to mention the generation reds but the show managed two things right keep the nonreds relevant and give the villains a story
  unfortunately bandai is the owner de facto and japan has the retarded tradition of blaming the underlings for their superiors failures bandai picked the mecha designs and theme while the staff did their best with what they got but its easy to blame the employees for the failures of their superiors
  they havent even dealt with dogranio yet
  they are by far the worst villains in sentai so far tame as fuck barely a menace  just like jark matter then
lvp is going to be one of the underrated gems of the franchise and people who discover it later will be singing praise to this show because theyve bingewatched it which is the proper way to watch lvp
keiichiro is adorable
  how the fuck is utsunomiya a tv asahi guy tv asahi producers get in for all three toei shows and not just sentai    it was written like that so that kids can jump in whenever and not getting lost its hard to see this nowadays because you have internet and streaming but there was a reason for it    jark matter actually went out and did something
  no theyd binge watch it and then say why were the pats even a thing if they are essentially written off of the main plot
  this happens every fucking time
    only two of the rangers have actually seen dogriano period
  bingewatched it which is the proper way to watch lvp  yeah thats why they released it week by week because it was meant to be bingewatched
  that too
  that whole scene just made me feel really warm and fuzzy inside
sound  
  jark matter were organised had clear goals made recognisable progress in their plans to show that theyre a serious threat and their leaders regularly appeared to intimidate/fuck with the kyurangers not to mention their links to scorpio and dr anton the stuff with naga going hebi metal luckys dad garus backstory etc gave the kyurangers a direct personal emotional stake in the fights the final plan ended up being really really fucking stupid madokko got old pretty quickly and they struggled to keep up with the hero power creep at times but in all they had a lot more going for them than the ganglers do dogranio hardly even gives enough of a shit to get angry when his guys lose
  dont forget jark matter actually had conquered planets and had people living in fear of them and you felt it sometimes they didnt subjugate people or they had some idiot running the planet sure but they definitely had more of a presence    honestly a big fault of theirs is showing dogranio can wipe the floor with everyone with next to no effort and then he just farts around his mansion acting bored we have zamigo going away for 30ish episodes so everything built up around him in these past couple of episodes isnt really that interesting gauche showed up for the upgrade but it was more her creation that did stuff than her and destra fought them once but then went away as well until this episode where he felt like he jobbed after the noel fight they really should have been a bit more involved and not used this plot point of needing to take over the reigns since its clearly not workingtheyve led like 40 lambs to the slaughter and not one has even gotten close and the ones with abilities that could are such idiots using them plus dogranio just doesnt give a damn you think hed be mad about this but instead he just feels mildly inconvenienced nearly all the ganglers he wanted to overtake him died and the only ones that can take his spot are the three seemingly left
  would be interesting if they show some coup happening and he no sweat them all but its already so late
  it almost looks like a good show almost
  the gangler structure of power is confused    you have someone with status double gold like destra who is your strongest fighter the brawler that will get dirty at the boss command and always get thing done but he does have any singler of the shiny collection then what the fucking point of his double gold safe why he just stick around the base doing nothing     gauche is the type of vixen that will bail out as soon as shit hit the fan yet in the future you wil see she takes to the frontline and get personal and get her dirty that is completely out of character for someone who is a female fatale/ mad scientis like her    jamigo and what the heck is his role in the serieshe is also status double gold which mean he is the top executive of the gang supposed to be as strong as destra but everytime you see he fight he lose and then he disspeard never to be hear again the series hint that he has fallout with the gang yet they still work together why
  it was written like that so that kids can jump in whenever and not getting lost    except many sentai actually had plot that wasnt shoved to the beginning and end of the shows
  they also used to have some regard for audiences over the age of five though
you know touma could have said that he learned those moves on aerobics class that could have cleared some suspicions
  hed rather get thrown in prison forever than admit that ever happened
    this   i wanna eat with this policeman too
anyone else remember magiranger    i miss magiranger and i wish lupin vs pat was like it
i am a week behind and nani
  from the movie with the red good striker see that what hes holding
  patren ugou looks better
  i kinda dig tricolors stained glass look desu
  but he does have any singler of the shiny collection then what the fucking point of his double gold safe  i think its that he doesnt want to just carry them around with him if he doesnt need them hes such a big badass that he can dominate people without needing collection pieces so why bother with exposing them to the thieves right  jamigo and what the heck is his role in the series  id be very surprised if there wasnt some complication with the actor that led to his role getting slashed to almost nothing until now
    destra gave his pieces to other ganglers they were sniping and projectile course correction
  i saw this scene draws a big smile on my face  hes so cute
if char battled them during operation stardust how would they do
  poorly
chad gato and chad newtype char would be way too much ko wasnt a newtype
  i think the titan would get lot more support
  i actually wonder if the fed would break amuro out of retirement for it   amuro in the gp03
depends on what suit hes in tbqh sure hed wreck shit in the neue ziel but put him in the drac or any of the other junk suits the delaz fleet was using and hed be in for a much more uphill struggle that said if he was even in a gelgoog marine hed probably push things more in gatos favor
but the real question is why char would be back in the earth sphere in 83 battlelust hamans orders or maybe something else
  wherever there is zeon char must betray it
  char you betrayed us  i was never loyal from the start gato tell that to the zabis when you go to hell
  i know a guy with skills
would char stop cime or join in
  hes most likely join in then betray her later
  see
  if char battled them during operation stardust how would they do    theyd be dead
    ko wasnt a newtype  the newtype sound plays while hes fighting monsha in the desert
  i came here to betray you
next time on msg 0083    something on the radar its a ms and its three times as fast as the others     whats your name kid  amuro ray    so we meet again amuro
  then hes a shitty newtype
  cime betray char first    char so that what if feels like
     if char battled them during operation stardust how would they die    you might as well just ask that really
  maybe char would toy with them and just hinder their journey
  gp01 in nu colors this early    you can do better than that
  that really fits the gp01
  op char would unceremoniously rape them and im sure he could do it solo kou wasnt that talented nor was anyone else on that ship
  they could barely handle gato char would rape them
  that said if he was even in a gelgoog marine hed probably push things more in gatos favor  how thought gato achieved all of his objectives even with char they would still all die at the end to the federation fleet
  are you implying that char is a better pilot than gato lol get real kid gato wasnt even a newtype and he would still rip char a new one
  this whats the point in offing the zabis then hell just work with zabi fanatics later
  yeah   oh and send my regards to garma will you   and what would you want me to bring back to prince garma traitor  tell him he was my only friend blasts the cockpit
    not him but gato is an overrated pilot who the plot blows at every chance it can but whos never as impressive as they try to make him which is especially apparent when kou is his major competition char would leave him in his wake and amuro would go through him like tissue in 0079 even if some games want to pretend gato drew with amuro at solomon
  the implication was that gato alone was more than they could handle with char included they wouldnt have a chance   that said char was literally a match for amuro up til cca and amuro is one of the best pilots in the federation and their second best ace     char rarely flexes because hes almost always chasing single targets but he is a solid pilot and most likely better than gato do you think gato would last an hour against amuro
  gatofags are just the lowest
  beautiful
  gato isnt even as good as ramba ral let alone char
  has gato even shown anything at the level of char because i cant buy him being higher
  amuro fights gato in a noncanon video game cutscene and amuro says he would have died if gato didnt choose to retreat earlier
  amuro in stardust memory    wew lad that would be fun to watch
  id love to see monsha shit talking him not believing hes the white devil hed probably be a cameo at luna as a test pilot or something hed likely take a gm custom out to aid kou against kelly on the moon
char would go easy on them ends up killing some of them bellri style    i guess your friend couldnt even dodge my warning shots    only kou and keith barely make it as char turns his focus to betray the delaz fleet and heads out to axis again
pretty sure if char join up delaz fleet amuro will return back from retirement and will joining aueg and become the one who piloting rick dias and rescue camille
  what encounters in space who cares what the game says the only reason i dont roll over that bitch gato faster is because its worth more points to break his shield first    eis also has stats for all of the pilots for use in coop versus and char is equal to or just plain better than gato in every category and you can make a custom pilot and run them through the one year war and try to build them to be better than everybody because the cap the named characters have on their stats is 20 while you can build them up to 50 if you are pretty fucking good at the game
  thatd be an interesting divergence i wonder how amuro and kamille would develop their relationship more brotherly/father and son they both lost their parents and such
  fights kou motherfucking i hate carrots and being competent with women uraki to a draw despite kou being pathetically mediocre at best  still thinks char would struggle against him    gonna have to troll harder than that son
  so the red comet comes to steal my glory  gato would be more mad than anyone
  cant ever take on cime but thinks he can take on char
  real talk though how the fuck does anybody know who gato is hes the nightmare of solomon and they mention him being in the history books but didnt both amuro and char fight at solomon    like can you name the guy who had the secondmost fighter kills in wwi second to the red baron i bet you cant if youre not a historian specializing in that shit nobody cares about the secondbest guy he doesnt get a nickname and a history book entry
  nu gundam isnt black
  char   best at solomon   char literally stopped mattering after loum he didnt rack up crazy kills and most of the time was too busy killing zabis or chasing amuro     char doesnt even crack into the top ten of zeon aces neither does gato for that matter and hes still pretty fucking famous
  char was not at solomon also  implying char was zeons top ace  implying either him or gato were even in the top five
  char was definitely zeons top ace and only the contrarian clowns on /m/ could possibly argue otherwise if youre going up bring up noncanon stuff to rebut this be sure to bring up the beltorchikas children manga where char skull drags amuro all over axis and only loses because a psychic fetus deflects 30m diameter beam shots multiple times to save amuro which makes char not only zeons best pilot but the best pilot in the entire uc timeline
  nobody cares about the secondbest guy he doesnt get a nickname and a history book entry  never go to /his/
  char skull drags amuro all over axis and only loses because a psychic fetus deflects 30m diameter beam shots multiple times to save amuro  the fuck did i read
  everyone in uc takes their required class the history of giant robots and their pilots in middle school
  they give amuro the fag no more char or gato
  but seriously how would this go
  big dick nightingale dabs on the hinu
    bright noa becomes captain and slaps ko now wheres monsha he needs one too
  yeah that actually happens its even more ridiculous than it sounds
  if you embrace the gato wank then gato in a dom was superior to amuro in the gundam and amuro only survived because gato was recalled before he could kill amuro whereas char could only break even with amuro while flying the zeong
  did gato tell you that
      char doesnt even crack into the top ten of zeon aces neither does gato for that matter and hes still pretty fucking famous    in your estimation who are the top ten zeon aces
  hes going by that ass old list of aces by kill count from some 80s databook full of names that have next to zero story and explanation attached for most of them    1 brenev auggs 193 ms  8 ships  2 nordit bauer 191 ms  4 ships  3 johnny ridden 185 ms  6 ships  4 erick mansfield 156 ms  3 ships  5 shin matsunaga 141 ms  6 ships  6 gabby hazard 138 ms  2 ships  7 robert gilliam 115 ms  6 ships  8  grennis escort 103 ms  12 ships
  12 fucking ships  based chadcort
  maybe if these goddamn writers would get off of chars dick for a minute then other people could have fun stories too    and either way next to no story is still twice the story than virtually every federation pilot who wasnt on the white base gets
  dont old databooks also put the number of total ms in the war much lower than those combined numbers  this sort of thing happened irl tho german top aces claimed to shoot down so many planes that they wouldve shot down all the planes in their theatre
    even better since gms were only active for a couple months till the wars end so auggs would be pulling 10 ms or so a day to get those numbers
    outside of ridden and matsunaga i havent heard of any of these niggers
  did they kill so many balls that they didnt bother to count them
  it might count balls and shit like saberfish and tin cods too
  balls i could see them trying to bullshit in but the rest wouldnt fly by the guys in charge of kill tallies
  dont old databooks also put the number of total ms in the war much lower than those combined numbers  nope old databooks like gundam century 1981 had massively high numbers like claiming there were over 3000 zaku f types alone produced        specifically that list of zeon aces comes from a book called entertainment bible 39 heres the feddy list for the other side of the coin    1 tenneth a jung 149 ms  3 ships  2 amuro ray 142 ms  9 ships  3 lydo wolf 68 ms  4 ships  4 charles kissingham 52 ms  2 ships  5 lon kou 43 ms  3 ships  6 franklin novotony 41 ms  1 ship  7 heinz baer 37 ms  2 ships  8  deris hanover 32 ms    this sort of thing happened irl tho german top aces claimed to shoot down so many planes that they wouldve shot down all the planes in their theatre  yep claims of how many were shot down generally almost always differ almost invariably each side will claim to have lost fewer planes than the other side said were shot down and that they scored more kills than the other side would have claim to lost sure theres room for some error and sometimes probable kills are just counted along with definite kills but some of it also seems like national pride as well
  agreed i dont exactly buy into this whole char is a bad pilot meme but gato always struck me as better than him in battle char was smart and got what he wanted but im positive the nightmare of solomon was at least a little better than that
  char got the hang of mobile suits faster than everyone else but never become a really good pilot    its like his skill at piloting hit 6/10 when everyone else in zeon was still around 23/10 while the federation was fielding balls but after that he only got to 7/10 at best while amuro started at 5/10 and was 10/10 by the end of msg
  1 tenneth a jung 149 ms  3 ships  2 amuro ray 142 ms  9 ships    amuro not the top acewhat
  how is amuro not top his ship kills should count way more
  dont worry the earth federation send us back upoh god
    you guys sound incredibly hurt is it so bad that he doesnt have top kills
  considering he is gundam jesus and singlehandedly won the war
  its odd thats all all the zeeks trying to kill the white devil
  wait if amuro of all people is second best who on earth outranks him    t 0092 graduate      of course hes got a rubbish name      hes not kira the feds won because they could rebuild their forces faster than zeon could ever hope to achieve and shook off demoralization after an old man told them to the white base and devil didnt hurt either    despite the absurdly high ball casualty rate its possible that he was a good pilot and raped zakus when given the opportunity alternatively he piloted a saberfish during the ill fated ground invasion before getting a gm worst most likely possibility is that friends in high places inflated his record considering how lukewarm amuro is to the ef even with his legendary service he probably wouldnt be their post war posterboy and thus got shafted
  so youre telling me this balding boomer in a gm has better killcount than amuro despite  1 being an oldtype  2 piloting a far weaker machine  3 piloting the aforementioned weaker machine for a far shorter amount of time than amuro piloted the gundam  okaaaay   the side material is just ridiculous i realize that oyw is supposed to be the biggest conflict in human history but theyre making it out to be so damn chokeful of ebin stories of heroism rivalry and these amazing exploits when it was only just one year
does anyone know a site you can watch stardust memory eng sub
  being an oldtype  kill count has a lot more to do with than just being an oldtype or newtype where the person is stationed how much combat they see and what role they have matters just as much if not more besides hes rumored to be a newtype    piloting a far weaker machine  gm sniper ii is one of the best gm models of the oyw and has higher specs than the rx78 in some areas gm command is nothing to laugh at either both already out perform the vast majority of zeon ms save for the rare high end types the standard gm is already a decent match if not better than the most common zeon ms    piloting the aforementioned weaker machine for a far shorter amount of time than amuro piloted the gundam  you dont even know his story since its not detailed anywhere could be some bullshit like he started piloting not long after amuro    the side material is just ridiculous i realize that oyw is supposed to be the biggest conflict in human history but theyre making it out to be so damn chokeful of ebin stories of heroism rivalry and these amazing exploits  i dont even get why youre complaining like you feel insecure that some nobody could have a record on par with amuro and that isnt allowed because amuro is too special to have anyone close to him the top guy on the list of zeon aces shot down damn near 200 feddy ms and probably isnt a newtype either does it annoy you that hes potentially achieved more than amuro or char and probably made most of those kills using a zaku or dom using machine guns and bazookas since gelgoogs and beam weapons are rare as fuck and appear even later than the gms official rollout    when it was only just one year  the war quite literally involved the entire population of the world and the colonies meaning billions were caught up in the conflict and the idea of more than one person managing 150 kills to his name is too much for you to believe just because it was a short time what the fuck
      ms kills cobnut more than ship kills even though ships house squads of ms and the entire crew  what the fuck is wrong with these stats
  piloted ms vs unpiloted
  screw char being absent where the fuck is gato
  i think the zeon list is bullshit too theres no way those counts dont include balls and saberfish
  the zeek list is just as bad  amuro obviously didnt win the war on his own but he was stated throughout multiple shows to be the most valuable asset during the oyw   i can kinda understand char not being on the list since he spent a lot of time fucking around in the newtype labs and whatnot but amuro was wrecking shit left and right from the moment he got gundam    you feel insecure that some nobody could have a record on par with amuro  youre the one who seems insecure i dont care for amuro its just not logical  feddie pilots have no experience in mobile suit combat they get their mses much later that amuro to begin with and they have no newtype hax    could be some bullshit like he started piloting not long after amuro  he pilots mass produced gms though
  kill counts arent about killing as many individual lives as possible otherwise they would just lump everything together into number of lives ended instead of bothering to to keep ms and ship kills separately and dozle would be near the top just because he probably took down maybe a dozen or more ships at solomon alone or something      gato didnt even exist when these lists were made      no shit but people are oddly fixated on these must be ms only it wouldnt make sense that zeon would only start counting kills 11 months into a 12 month long war out of some kind of foolish honorable well wait for you guys to develop ms before we start counting bs      but amuro was wrecking shit left and right from the moment he got gundam  white base didnt exactly join frontline combat until after it left jaburo until then it was mostly on the run to try and reach jaburo and performing missions at the request of revil doing things like attacking mquves base to serve as a distraction during operation odessa i dont see why its a stretch for other forces in frontline combat to be able to rack up kills since theyre literally in the thick of it    feddie pilots have no experience in mobile suit combat  so what you just think it isnt logical for the feds to have any aces at all and all of them should be a bunch of rank amateurs who dont know what theyre doing funny enough fielding inexperienced newbies is something usually attributed to zeons ms forces near the end of the war since pilot attrition rates were supposed to be high and they didnt have the luxury of pulling back exhausted troops to replace them with rested replacements which is the same situation wwii japan and germany faced    he pilots mass produced gms though  for all we know the kill counts could be padded with plane/tank kills its not a stretch for a mobile suit to wreck a bunch of planes and tanks easily
kekking so hard at how butthurt people are about other pilots existing besides amuro and char
     white base didnt exactly join frontline combat until after it left jaburo    there wasnt a lot of front line combat to join until odessa because the war was at a stalemate for several months on the other hand zeon forces constantly harrassed the white base for several weeks until they reached jaburo as in seemingly combat for that period m aning they almost certainly saw more combat in that few weeks than most soldiers saw all war long given average life span and how often a given front would see combat
  char sat out a fair bit of the war doing newtype shit but amuro was their only pilot and piloting the most advanced suit they had while being a space psychic
  and he was still only one person in one sector of any war not including the times his gundam was grounded different sectors of the war being relevant at different times or how fuck huge battles like solomon and a baoa qu were while amuro was fucking off with char     people also seriously underestimate how good gms are theyre basically a gundam with slightly shittier armor it really isnt unimaginable that one good pilot couple rack up 150 kills in 3 or 4 of the later battles     amuro was great but he didnt singlehandidly win the oyw
    what newtype shit did char sit out parts of the war doing
  char would win because shitty writing only allows him to lose to amuro
    
    char didnt face anyone else of consequence in the entire stretch of the first show one of his biggest fights against a named character was when lt woody crashed a hover thingy in to his zgoks head he faced so few named opponents outside amuro
  the whole shit with lalah
    then its wrong because he was at texas for a few days at most just like the white base and he was still actively engaged in combat several times during those days regardless his ship took out wakkeins ship for instance
  that still doesnt disprove the fact that char is only allowed to lose to amuro
    it does mean that your point has no proof of its own however since theres no instance of char not losing to another named character
  by the shit with lalah i think he means the whole flannigan institute
    the only thing he did in that case was send her there theres nothing indicating he ever went there until he collected her or that he spent significant time finding and housing her himself during the animations
  theres garma
  another named character  irrelevant     the claim still stands char is not allowed to lose to anybody other than amuro
    he didnt fight garma he gave garma false information        irrelevant the claim still stands char never faced anyone besides amuro so whether he was allowed to lose or not isnt possible to establish
best mazinger iteration a one off comic made for the american audience   why can i not get a full series with this amazing aesthetic
  z mazinger has the same aesthetic as does nagais other mecha manga made in the 90s
oh man there goes the kingdom of big titted giants who nearly made me their king  time to go back to the endless giant robot war    how the fuck did this thing flop
  flop it was never meant to be more than a one time story
  i wish it was longer and only about the endless giant robot war
i am specifically looking for mecha games for the psp in particular but suggestions for other systems are fine preferably games that already have an english translation or dont really require reading pic somewhat related xenogears is probably my favorite rpg
  armored core 3 silent line and formula front
  i already own all of those
  last raven i think front mission 3 you can get for psp i dont own a psp so i dont know the library well
  gundam battle universe sd gundam g generation overworld srw z2 hakaihen and saiseihen
  dont really require reading  play gundam vs gundam next plus
i heard the eureka seven games werent too shabby but im pretty sure they dont have an english translation
  play games   you need to be over 18 to post on 4chan
  hes not a manchild  what are you doing here
  go back to /v/ kid
  yeah we only do adult things like watch cartoons and play with fucking toys
  these overworld has an english patch if you want to get that too
    i suppose i shouldnt have to mention it but theres the zoe games
  i really liked zettai hero project an rpg where a random guy trains to be the next absolute victory unlosing ranger and save the world most of the equipment is /m/ two different rocket punches and you get your own themesong and stuff its hilarious check it out
  play with fucking toys  no one on /m/ said we play with toys but thanks for showing more proof that your a kid
  ms saga a new dawn is ok   i have eureka seven vol 1 the new wave
  noone has mentioned kikaioh yet    gentle/m/en i am disappointed    
macross frontier trilogy on psp if you want me to recommend just one because theyre basically the same go for ultimate frontier
  why not triangle
  i see you on every vidya thread except the srw general
  they were amazing and both e7 games got a us release the 2nd one has a survival mode such good times i had in that mode   100 battles won with nirvash theend  the mc lfo which you could cheat with big time any other unit would vary between 50100 wins but those 3 i could always get past 100 wins no problem
  this pretentious assmunch again  youre on a board for fictional giant robots featured primarily in cartoons made for children kindly fuck off      im not sure if theres an english patch floating around online but ive heard good things about vulcanus seek and destroy that might be something to look into
  what are gunplas  what is /m/ merchandise  i really hope youre shitposting
  he is ignore
is gundam breaker 3 any good i know its great for creating your own mobile suits but is the game itself fun
  yeah its a beat em up where you get to play as your favorite ms you can string combos together with different parts and special moves the boss fights are kind of ass but its fun fighting the regular enemies
  is that lockon    that picture is intense
    xenogears a shit
anyone have a high res image of this i can only find potato versions for some reason
  not sure what youre going for is this any better its from hljs listing
lol gundam unicorn can travel time with just 3 kw    wow gundam has really good writers
huh
  only 3kw
  i feel like youve posted this thread before and it wasnt funny the first time
  general rule of thumb whenever looking at the specs of a mobile suit always add a reasonable exponent if you want to reconcile those specs with onscreen feats ms always weigh exponentially more require exponentially more power put out exponentially more thrust and usually accelerate at an exponentially higher rate than their specs would indicate
  i feel like youve posted this thread before and it wasnt funny the first time  back then people just said it was just speculation or hoax  now it is the truth
    if mobile suits accelerated exponentially higher than indicated then the pilots would be liquidated by the act of acceleration and travel times in the setting wouldnt make any sense either which would require mentally rejiggering them which in turn would require mentally ignoring a lot of well why didnt they just send x to help with y problem since itd only take a few hours kind of thinking the power is definitely off but the acceleration isnt particularly weird
  psycomu was a mistake
  just 3 kw  remind me when did physicists come up with a way to travel back in time last time i checked we werent able to do so yet how do you know that it wont be possible with a single watt because thats what the current laws state
is the time travel just an excuse to decanon the later uc works like f91 so bandai/sunrise can do their new universal century bullshit on a clean slate
  minovsky inertia control science     also 12gs is nothing literally its so dumb that in the 80s one of the books suggested that the listed acceleration is just a normal traveling value for when the thrusters are at a normal output for cruising but the max output is much higher
  i wouldnt be surprised if f91 onwards will still be used but relabeled as uc alternative or something so that their vapid new trash can be the main timeline
  f91 will still be used they explained some of its tech being based around how psychoframes work
  who cares these machines run on autism no electricity
truly banagher you are beyond the time  really sunrise
  i hope so  zz and v modular suits are ugly as fuck
  thats how much of a loser you are banagher is autistic enough to pilot the unicorn yet he still has a girlfriend meanwhile you kissless virgin despite having a lower powerlevel
  i think thats the only way they could do it the full body psychoframe garbage is just too powerful just to say and everybody agreed not to mess with it or study it anymore when it can turn back time and make you into a god how ironic that when unicorn opened up its own pandoras box with the timeline with all this perfected newtype/gundam singularity unit01 nonsense
  kissless  fucked ur mum last nite  pick one
    they also have linear seats and gsuits to help further reduce look at irl gel filled gsuits now imagine what uc ones can do i think a reduction of 5 or more gs is a reasonable estimate and a number of times weve seen ms have over 3gs of acceleration which isnt terrible given their size and mass
not a single gundam has decent writing  you were tricked by this dumpster board
  its mostly theoretical edge cases to physics as theyre understood particularly as enumerated by relativity     not sure if qm permits it probably not but qm has its own weird spooky stuff to make up for that
the time travels stuff is due to psychoframe magic  psychoframe runs on feelings not physics      general rule of thumb whenever looking at the specs of a mobile suit always remember that the screenwriters for gundam barely care  ftfy
    quantum entanglement could be seen as a form of time travel since disrupting one shared particle causes the other to instantly react regardless of distance including greater than the distance possible for light to travel in the distance between paired disruptions the idea that there may only be a single photon in existence and all matter is just the observation of it interacting in a particular time frame is related to quantum mechanics as well and again implies time travel
  i pick kissless for you    i dont think you thought this witty retordt through
  is the time travel just an excuse to decanon the later uc works like f91 so bandai/sunrise can do their new universal century bullshit on a clean slate  a i honestly dont see why you think they would need time travel for that    and     b twilight axis already made references to cosmo babylonia so in the instance that anything changes i doubt itll be much
  thats because it was done several times in the past was blatant shilling for a shit youtube channel and was also not funny
why cant toho make their own kaiju girls show but with their own monsters and make it a magical girl show with giant monsters instead of shitty ultraman monsters nothing but boring slice of life shit
  shitting on kaiju girls for being slice of life show about ultraman monsters  every episode is literally five minutes long    anon i
why would a toho kaiju girls be much different than this
ultraman monsters are seen as a very japanese thing so it makes sense to make an otaku oriented show like this  godzilla and the gang are seen as having more of a worldwide appeal
  shitty ultraman monsters  im afraid i must inform you that you have shit taste king joe redking zetton etc are all awesome
i dont know lets get godzilla mothra rodan and anguirus along with spacegodzilla and destroyah and have them isekaid into another world they end up in humanish forms with some of their kaiju traits carried over their powers are weaker in these new forms but still strong enough to go toe to toe with powerful forces and they require magic from the locals to temporarily transform back to their full forms also they have fleshed out personalities and voice being able to interact with each other and the natives instead of one boring mc who does things effortlessly lets have 6 new additions to the new world trying to adjust to their new bodies while still being able to contribute to the slaying of monsters which threaten the people there and spacegodzilla and destroyah are off doing their own thing
  moe anthropomorphism is pure cancer
  this is the only ultra property ive watched

  in votoms episode 3
jigoku wo episode 3
  be sure to watch his later stuff like gasaraki blue gender and flag too
  i heard people really didnt like any of those shows they all sound interesting though
  havent seen blue gender yet but gasaraki is weird flag is perhaps generation kill of anime
  yes he absolutely wreaks the shit out of the motorcycle gang with his scopedog in votoms episode 3
    just watch votoms episode 3
  i enjoyed them all except blue gender
which episode of votoms
  episode 3 of course

  votoms episode 3     chirico meets gotho coconna and vanilla for the first time while building a scopedog out of scraps in gothos salvage yard to escape uoodo meanwhile esukai takes over the uoodo police and begins to put the clamps to the gang he plans to kill off the gang and chirico inadvertently gets involved killing a good chunk of the gang before he goes into some sort of ptsd induced coma while fires burn around him 
  you know i had forgotten what happened in votoms episode 3 but after reading that summary i remembered that it was one of my favorite earlier episodes
so can you guys explain why kids love the narrative of votoms episode 3
kakusareta votoms episode 3  dadadowdowdowdowdadadow

  mlaios
watched blue gender years ago and fucking hated it decided to never touch this directors shows ever  decided to watch votoms today and after 3 episodes i already love it
  fucking amazing
i guess we really were the episody 3 after all
  
you know votoms episode 3 is cool and all but i think episode 4 is better
  its a joke from a thread where the op posted a screencap from gundam i think it was the scene where the gundam enters the texas colony and the gundam casts a long shadow the op said something along the lines of am i the only one who liked this show one anon replied saying he loved mecha looking at its own shadow and the rest is history it was similar to this thread where a snide comment spiraled out of control i dont have the screenshot of the thread though
  votoms hat in tf2 scopedog rifle in csgo please

  star wars credits scrolls seem inherently stange at high framerates
  but who is wood punchman
  but who is wood punchman    hes that guy from votoms episode 3
  thats really stupid but i lost my sides
which one was most popular in japan
  i think reconguista failed in japan
  the same one that was more popular everywhere else
  greco sales avaerge  90k  ibo sales average  83k    greco ratings  187 on a late night slot  ibo s1 ratings average  20  ibo s2 ratings average  13    by the end of the day its probably ibo due to having more gunpla sales and noiterity despite having worse home video ratings and some might argue critical acclaim greco was gimped pretty hard by sunrise but it did pretty decent despite everything stacked up against it
  neither
  in the nhk poll ibo was ranked 6th greco was ranked 27th
  ibo is one of the most popular anime of our time
  jap memes are so autistic
  but theyre nearly exactly the same as ours regarding ibo
  in the nhk poll  worthless
  less than 50k votes were tallied in that poll and was based on fucking twitter retweets
how far until season/film three also season two gunpla when really want the acguy and gouf    
until sunrise is done finishing the nt movie and after that just maybe
i just wonder what the overall popularity of thunderbolt is and if it did well in terms of sales i really love the manga and hope we keep gettin model kits because id kill for an mg atlas
  wasnt thunderbolt voted the one of the worst series by nips  that probably explains why the tb gunpla line dried up
  worst  least popular nevertheless it scored higher than greco
  okay thanks for the correction
that ball cute
  nips didnt like greco even though they understood the series
  nips have shit taste
  it seems like its a lot more popular in the west than in japan
  how far until season/film three also season two gunpla when    never never    bye
  dame i got into this
  it feels like its geared more towards a western audience anyways
  understanding it / liking it
they could have at least made the pyscho zaku a high mobility or act zaku converted
  ms06r zaku ii high mobility type reuse p device    b r u h
best girl
  talk about a fucked up scene  getting teleported into another dimension
  my bad i watched thunderbolt before really getting into gundam i should go rewatch it  
  theres also hathaways flash and the greco movies its probably unlikely to get a continuation which is a bit of a shame since it was a nice way of getting some uc on a semi regular basis
  im pretty sure she is going to end up ded
  please no
  not sure it will get a s3 the manga has gotten kinda lame though more gunpla would be cool
  season 2 was fucking garbage so i dont have much hope for a sequel
  they hardly had any gunpla lined up for the second season just the atlus and a ground gundam and i guess the two verka releases the majority of the models were made for the manga and just recoloured for the anime release its weird and a big shame that we didnt the acguy rick dom or anything else
  so still possible for the pla kit line if they go by the manga
its getting mass produced according to gundam nt
looks like it produced enough mass already
  we still dont know if its the original one refurbished or a 2nd unit    either way only 2 units is not in any way mass production
  and its zeon their going to fuck it up somehow
  it still something only a shitty unoriginal fan fic would do regardless
  yes we do its a second unit and its not getting mass produced
  its more indicative of a psycoframe arms race if anything
  welcome to literally everything uc gundam since the original trilogy of msg/z/cca
  be zeon    make powerful weapon mobli armor or ms  waste some fodder  completely fuck it up in the end    seems par for the course every time
  leaving out zz  i assume youre new here
  where do they keep getting all that money to produce these
poor big zam never had a chance
  mquves gold bullion asteroids and fanatic despotism
  wouldve won if they massproduced x  loses the war  still has enough  for the next one several times over
  kshatriya  a waste in any way
     in crossbone and crossbone alone because every spacenoid movements motivations and gaolsaje sense without invoking a secret third party conspiracy as is
  that brings even more questions    resource management is deadly serious in the empire  keeps wasting money on proxies and own endeavors
  yikes
  t (((man from jupiter)))
  we should honor and respect our 4chan counterparts you guys how else will we get our cocacola points
whats to say they cost a lot to begin with sure char paid for axis but the gold presented didnt seem like that much anyways 36 million if that rough shitty guess
  that gold seemed more like it was for the fed officials as a bribe
  how many of them are piloted by ples  thats all i care about
they built it from spare parts     spare parts
  what about big zam though
  go back to 4chan  (((tcrybaby)))
beautiful
    kinda like nazi germany
  that makes no sense whatsoever how is funding an opposing power going to create internal strife if their goal was to corrupt the federation from within then they would be funding coups like the new desides and extremist wings of the federation like the titans
  would mp big zams even cut it anymore
        so its just a repaint doesnt seem like it has anything new other than some red highlights
still looks pretty fuckin cool
  its a second neo zeong not the original repainted because creativity be damned this is a sequel to unicorn
  it only existed to job to anything that wasnt a mook and get penetrated
  it beat the banshee norn before trying to convert riddhe
  talking about the kit doesnt seem to offer anything new
  so basically it existed to cream anything not named unicorn or banshee the two suits who smashed everything other than each other including the neozeong and tanked a colony laser too    gotcha
  it seems really shameless to reuse designs like this especially giving the narrative gundam an armor that is designed to make it look like the unicorn it really feels like bandai just wants to push out more merchandise of proven designs instead of taking a chance on something even slightly new ill bet the narrative gundam only has the visible frame because barbatos kits sold well
  thats gundam narrative in a nutshell ironically narrative is the only unique design from the movieeverything else is just an existing design with a few minor details changed jesta sinanju stein phenex silver bullet i really cant see any reason to care about it as an entry to the franchise because it doesnt even add new designs its just retooling existing ones
  anaheim electronics gives neo zeon these suits and weapons at huge discount or even free sometimes never in enough quantity to outright beat the federation anaheim doesnt want a repeat of the one year war but in enough numbers to keep conflict going like a smoldering fire you never let die out you add just barely enough wood to keep it going slightly a controlled fire in this case a huge mobile armor a stolen gundam or squads of modern grunt suits every few years given to neo zeon    then the federation justified with their big budget goes to anaheim with a big order of jegans in order to fight those zeon remnants that somehow never seem to die anaheim then makes huge space bux    anaheim rinses and repeats its their business model for mobile suits
  based snri breaking the cycle
  more like ijn with their hugeass battleships
  no strife in the inner planets that is earth and the colonies since i dont think mars is a player at any point
  it existed only to destroy everything that wasnt a plot armor physical god  waste of money  i bet you it paid for itself after like 10 rezels
  the chest is modified like some kind of hidden weapons rack cant find bigger picture
  breaking the cycle  went bankrupt after making two good suits
  ok sure lets make new designs  for a work thats what one year after unicorn  which kinda stresses suspension of disbelief unless its a testbed pulled out of the mothballs as is the case with narrative  when the zeek of the week faction is so strapped for resources that if they pulled any brand new design out of their ass itd smack of some rancid bullshit     like honestly shilling new designs for a work thats really just one big oh yeah speaking of newtypes continuation of unicorns rant about the universal century would be putting the toy commercial aspects before the narrative
    its a dragon momoko kit
  pretty sure those flaps existed in the original although those silly bazookas were mega beam cannons
  ae had to steal snri tech to say afloat
  i mean development times in uc are lightning fast unicorn takes places 3 years after cca and they had time to make the sinanju from the nu  sazabi data test it have it stolen and make three unicorn variants off the sinanju data not to mention the neo zeong the zulus the kshatriya delta plus etc besides they could easily justify any new designs as either the unicorn conflict was an isolated incident so we didnt see many suits that existed at the time or this suit was almost ready by unicorn but it we finished it between uc and nt
  oy vey goyim why dont you buy our suits do you not want to protect yourself against the disgusting spacenoids theyre coming to rape your wife and kids or are you a zeek supporter
  found the fucking jovian
  im pretty sure that making new prototypes would be much more believable than there just so happening to be a second sinanju stein and there just so happening to be enough parts to create another neo zeong not to mention phenex was lost in space making new designs is a lot more credible than narrative a series of coincidences
  its actually not unheard of to build prototypes and other assorted experimental designs in multiples    i mean shit grandaddy rx7802 was second in whats the official record now 5 first generation 78pattern gundams
  no it definitely does make sense but thats something that should be established beforehand like how we are aware of 3 delta plus prototypes otherwise its yet another asspull retcon like phenexes existence and considering the neo zeong was so big it had to be towed behind the rewloola theres no way in hell that it wouldnt have been a one off order made custom considering it existed solely for the final conflict in unicorn it doesnt even make sense to have surplus parts let alone enough to make an entire other unit
  so basically everything nontomino is a shitty gundam fanfic k
  how does shittyshit work
  they also have spacenoid sympathetic executives in places high enough to leak transport routes or locations of prototype machines    either in hopes the zeeks steal them and upgrade their arms or for plausibly deniable field testing of new weapon systems
so would gundam nt go back to the past and fix uc forever    would we be getting in some kind of paradox
  the same way something can be darker than black
  perhaps the economics of production favored making multiples of the neozeongs components maybe the design was finicky enough to warrant a few spare parts in case it acted up      maybe there wasnt a full zeongs worth of spare parts but enough such that constructing whats missing would be feasible
  ok now youve lost it
  i know i can kill
  id say it would make sense to build spares of the sensitive components but the frame itself would be absurd to have another lying in storage you couldnt just deplete an entire mining asteroids resources because you might need spare parts for the neo zeong
  well its largely a matter of how much spare part were talking about under the hood could be a cobbled together mess that keeps all the surface components together plus or minus any psycoframe wizard bullshit    actually whatd kill me is if the whole thing is actually held together by newtype will and copious application of psycoframe
     the feds literally talk about how its going towards social welfare and they kind of need it just to make those payments   its immediately handed to someone from an audit bureau   it seems like its just a bribe    hmm
  the majority of the upper torso is taken up entirely by weapon systems custom made for the neo zeong as far as i know thats why the sinanju is necessary to pilot it like the dendrobium the whole suit is a mobile armory with a large amount of boosters strapped to it
  the new z movie retconned that halfassed anime
  oh no its this shitpost again
  not as cool as the regular version though
  inuniverse explanation is that the ii neo zeong read second neo zeong is built from spare parts left over from development of full frontals neo zeong    the shoulder weapon bays have new frames to make them stronger and the bays front hatches were removed theyre open all the time with no cover the new parts were painted red now the arms themselves not just the fingers have wired range control meaning its even more like the zeong
  zoltan akkanen was able to build this in an asteroid  with a box of scraps
  wasnt rozen zulu also kitbashed spare parts from sinanju though stein didnt have any of them
  the rozen zulu is a hammahamma with geara zulu parts and sinanju boosters
fuck spacenoids
  what about the psyco jammers
  the what
  there are other hammahamma
  were those sinanju i could have sworn i saw some drac verniers
  rozen zulus jamming rose funnels
  boosters dont look like sinanjus
  factposting is not shitposting
17028227  /pol/ppet forced meme   filtered
  eh close enough the only parts that really look sinanju are the forearms and the leg armor
  theyre being funded by the republic of zeon
  is it also missing pieces coverings also wondering boyega ever finish his kit
    
    not that guy but their predecessors did kick damn near everyone off the planet welfares probably a smaller expense not that it helps any when the feds probably spend it all on hookers and blow
     yea well they did bad things in the past   and welfare is probably just code for personal wealth in some form    the only thing the movie ever indicates they used the cash for is welfare headcanon doesnt trump that it shouldnt even be a surprise because for all the bad shit the federation did and there is plenty they are obviously a welfare state the sides are the greatest welfare project in history and hundreds of them were destroyed in the last 15 years and would need reconstruction the motivation for it is at least partly selfish ie get these poor people away from me but its still a thing regardless which would not be remotely cheap
    autocorrect at work political commentary doesnt even make any sense in the context of that sentence
  too late bro i need a safe space
  because creativity be damned this is a sequel to unicorn  to be fair creativity be damned might as well have been unicorns motto
  theres not spamming completely new designs and then theres straight up reusing unicorn one offs because they already have toy molds
  does this mean sinanju had a second plan to kitbash into a hammahamma
  branch office reopened under different name and started making ms for religious nutjobs funded by jupiter
  unicorn made more money than the shitty for millennials version of zeta and unicorn needs zz to exist guess what money wins
  f91 heavygun jamesgun javelin
  i think hes referring to the f91 and the crossbone
  jamesgun and javelin are ae models you can read about their development here    v gundam msv handbook  
  damn sleeves
  sure unicorn was probably 50/50 rehashing designs especially after episode 4 on with all the remnants battles but at least it had some new designs like unicorn kshatriya jesta etc narrative has one new design and its a pretty polarising one at that but everything else is just a design that showed up in unicorn with some added details
  psycoshard is gonna get gimped isnt it  if it really has the reality warping powers from interviews then they will need an excuse for the pilot to give the enemy a chance again
  it takes place one year after unicorn why would everybody be fielding a bunch of brandnew grunt ms
    this is ridiculous
  would be putting the toy commercial aspects before the narrative  the narrative is literally centered around chasing down a gold repaint of the unicorn it already gives that impression before anything else
  why would you buy this when you can use that amount of resources to make 1020 unicorn series with the same amount of metal
  neo zeon and aeug were able to do just that in less than a year in zz not mention the titans monster of the week approach to ms design in zeta within the gundam universe a year is a hell of a long time in terms of ms design
  we all know zeeks steal their gundams/gms
  they should build that hypothetical unit from age  the one that can control hundreds of funnels 
  werent zimmad and zeonic absorbed into anaheim following the collapse of the principality of zeon makes sense that the company would be made out of people who used to work for both sides of the old conflict who now have ditched ideology in favor of personal wellbeing
  arent ae factories autonomous from one another you can have a facility full of ex zeeks and another manned by former feds
  they did it in zeta and zz  yeah and those were pretty flagrant 80s toy commercials i guess they could have made nt a toy commercial too but i dont think its a narrative failing that they didnt     ha ha
  new designs are reserved for obscureish sidestories if anything rehashed designs is one of the things nt did right
  i guess they could have made nt a toy commercial too  see  
    if youre bring sarcastic its a bit hard to make that out over text form but gundam is no less of a commercial cashgrab now than it was decades ago the whole point of the franchise is to sell kits to people and if theres no new designs then theres nothing to market    and as another aside i remembered that uc0094 existed so the sinanju stein delta kai and rebawoo were all fielded just a year after cca there is absolutely no precedent that they could not have new mobile suits fielded a year after the unicorn incident
  nt didnt create phenex  its there much like phoenix hunting was for the unicorn novels to act as a plot hole patch to explain how a third machine with potential to be ultra bullshit powerwise fits into the chronology right after unicorn and banshee were supposed to be mothballed
  what difference does that make its still advertising that suit regardless of where it came from
  zeonic and zimmad are from the same side of the conflict though the rest of ae are spacenoid/lunarian executives and workers i dont think theres a whole lot of earthnoids in ae its just that they do a shitton of business with the federation      sort of theres some databook fluff about different ae divisions that might have rivalries with each other in particular theres this article about the titans outsourcing psyco gundam variant development to anaheims titansfriendly 4th development division    
  narrative ver    thats your first hint
once the neo zeong is mass produced well put an end to the federation in no time
  see 
  its getting mass produced  maybe if sleeves steal the federal gold reserves  they are so broke they couldnt even afford arms and legs for zaku 50
  they are so broke they couldnt even afford arms and legs for zaku 50  nigga the zaku 50 is an anaheim invention intended to cash in on nostalgia    except they were on lsd when they designed it so besides the head its just a mobile armor
they say in the movie that ii was assembled from leftover parts for frontals neo zeong also they cant make any more because it uses crazy technology they dont understand that was made by chars ghost     im not even fucking kidding they make it sound like the fucking neo granzon
  spooky action from beyond the time
      speaking of rosen zulu is that gay sycophant making a return in nt
  hell show up later
  so hes currently hiding and gathering resources and shit
  bsods prostitutes himself finds his future wife and cleans himself up and married into the busch/ronah family and the rest is history
  gathering resources and shit  gathering garbage probably     his side story would probably bring him to the buch concern after drifting thru space and he becomes a junker after being taking in by buch he gradually works his way up the ranks and marries the heiress cecilys mom only to be cucked later on    f91 kicks in
  sauce id love a sidestory like that
  grows a bitchin stache too
  anon i just made it up on the spot to fit that image

  sounds like tit came from a gundam sousei backstory for f91
  original one refurbished  that shit got disintegrated bruh banagher turned it to dust by rusting it
    what are all these deleted posts
  what about that built with spare parts  if so they could just call it ii neo zerong and not ii neo zeong narrative ver
    apparently dyed every hairs on his body too
unit pandora is the best mecha anime of 2018
name a better moment in the series
  new trailer on the 9th
this is apparently the release version of the shma king ghidorah from kotm
what have they done to mothra
  theyve made her into a badass instead of a fuzzy cylinder that flies around a lot jobs sometimes or wins as a larvae for some reason    shes a blend of moths now and seems to have features of some of those moth species that mimic wasps
  the trilogy wasnt that good but fuck that scene at the end there with scarlet godzilla got me good the ost really made the scene for me
do the japs like mutos at all
  i kinda dig the possible retcon that the mutos are a relative/battra like strain of the same species    mothra can generate light laser hellbeams and the mutos can shit out electromagnetics
  some art here and there but so far they are pretty forgettable enemies
  theyve made her into a badass instead of a fuzzy cylinder that flies around a lot  you could have said why you preferred the new version without attacking the previous ones especially when you havent really seen the legendary version in action yet and kaneko went in a more mothlike direction without almost abandoning her general form
since kids in japan dont like robots anymore and weebs only watch it for the shippings are the new gridman toys doing well
  are the new gridman toys that arent out till next year doing well    no because 0 have been sold    you drooling inbred retard
the fuck has ssss got to do with kids its a latenight anime at the midnight slot
  1 am
  is it really airing that late holy shit
  wait can those things even pose at all     please dont tell me that the superhuman samurai syber squad toys i have stored in my closet are superior to new figures coming out in 2018
  late  am  early
  it is late until niggas start eating breakfast u pedantic cunt
  these sorts of sofubi/soft vinyl figures are meant to be cheap things a fewhundred yen each standard articulation is arms swivelling and thats it
  i see i wonder if theyll go the full mile and release something with full articulation and combining
  theres actually two on the way one from goodsmile and one from figma/max factory
  anyone have info on the classic gridman figure on the right im searching but all i find is the anime version
i mean its pretty clear the demographic for ssssgridman is /m/en who tend to buy toys    picking up generic anime fans who are just watching for the girls is just a side effect
  since kids in japan dont like robots anymore  bad meme kids in japan love robots when theres a good show to support it bad shows like webdiver are the reason why toys sales plummeted causing companies like bandai and takara tomy to stop producing them  just look at shinkalion everyone thought it was going to end at three cours like drive head did but its been extended multiple times due to its for a kids series high viewership and great toy sales its running through the new year and will be at least a five cour show
  figma isnt a company its a brand by good smile company the other gridman is by megahouse
  /thread
  making cheap supermarket quality toys for a late night anime  why tho
    soft vinyl toys for tokusatsu shows are a fucking tradition you ignorant cunts      and the ones that they make for adults easily reach 20003000          not vinyl
    i dont have money to preorder them i hope i can buy the gridman figures and assist weapons next year once i have saved up for them
  true shinkalion is actually the closest mecha show to adhere to the kids show to sell kids toys formula that has actually worked in years aside from gundam of course
lineart here      
  did you make this one which astray is it
  the astray gold frame amatsu mina it was on the seesaawiki being incomplete but it only needed some minor touchups still not perfect but hey its better than before  also damn thats a sweet lineart  turn xs head is the crotch  i guess you can say gym was a dickhead
  man seeing it close i know why i hate the lineart that was added recently in seesaa it is all to blocky and thick    i am trying to make a glucifer chimaira but the source image is so fucking bad that this will took some time to fix it
  cant you use this and just paste the head
  for some reason everything new thats been added to seesaa has been unfinished stuff
  i am too dumb to do this but there are lots of differences i tried one day to change turn a head for gself and failed i prefer to do it all over again    but even then there are lots of differences besides the head
posting this my halffinished hambrabi suban lineart sorry about the waist part nothing i did could make it look right
  it is just the waist the problem every else is fine
  waist tubes on the shoulders  the chest vents look like shite other than that its okay
    fixed some shit going on now you can recolor but there are lots of things to fix but dont give up
  gundaml1neart here is this new if so you want me to put on the imgur page besides is any lineart that you people made that you want to be posted on the page if so just say its name and upload a blank file and i will do it
  its from the jp site ive had it saved awhile so its not new
      thanks lineart anon i think my love for the geara doga just grew a little more
  that lineart just screams  kill me
  glad i could help out your fiending for dogas took these out of a aoz scan i think theres just a röte doga left to do
  get clem
  hehe it looks like a cat
    i cannot explain why i like purple  tan together but i do love the idea of the turn a using the turn x as some sort of armor pack
anything for this guy
  fuck me that looks great anymore frankens
  if you consider this a fraken
  not that guy but heres one of my firsts from two or three years ago
  thats really well done    is it bad that i can totally see that being an actual astray mode
  some other guy made it a while back i was just listening to some disco and wanted to repost it also was wondering if it would match the beat of the song but it didnt
    
  good stuff
  powerful
mudrock is love mudrock is life
cowboy bebop in srw  cowboy bebop in netflix    
  calling it by now    nigger spike
the casting for edward is already over
is there any way this wont be an absolute steaming turd
  theres always a chance   but its very slim
    who cares his race nationality and ethnicity had no bearing on spikes story even his gender barely matters to it
  netflix   well choreographed action  oh no no no
  black spike  mexican jet  frumpy faye  heavily implied sex change edward  great dane ein
    then theres no reason not to cast someone accurate is there
cause that sure worked out well for death note
  do not jinx it motherfucker im gonna burn some sage to dispel your bs
  youre right they should cast a jew because spike was flagrantly jewish im sure you wont complain about that now will you
  noooooo
  to be fair casting willem dafoe as ryuk was genius
  no phisical sets all cgi  no personal spaceships because muh realism  bebop is just a tub with bebop scribbled on the side  evoking the mad realism of the expanse     and if that wasnt enough to kill us with our possible hype  could be even worse    sjwfied ed complete with purple hair  overweight so not to comform with societal beauty standars empowered grrrrrrrrrrl that has to be obnoxiously loud
    yea there is the actor who can best portray the role isnt the same ethnicity race etc as the animated version
    oh fuck off you know damn well if they cast a black dude it wouldnt be for his skill
    i also know full well that theyre not going to be refusing a talented white/asian/whatever actor simply because theres a black guy in the room and that theyll pick someone of roughly equal skill to what the most talented person applying has based on expected pay from the actors or something
kosmo kramer would make the perfect spike
  seconded hollywood is far more considered with forcing diversity than actually hiring competent actors that can portray roles faithfully across adaptations physically and theatrically
  far more concerned
    literally nothing wrong with this stop projecting
  
everyone fucking shut the fuck up   showrunners include mission impossible ghost protocol cowriters andre nemec and josh appelbaum along with venom and jumanji welcome to the jungle cowriters jeff pinkner and scott rosenberg the first episode is written by christopher yost thor the dark world and ragnarok original anime director shinichiro watanabe is on board as a consultant    netflix will try to make it as close to the anime as possible they learned from the mistake that was death note      nonnetflix adaptation
  go away thomas
rumors are that joel kinnaman will play the role of spike with mahershala ali as jet
  unironically would not mind joel but it should be keanu
  youre legitimately retarded ed is actually the only character in the main cast that the creators didnt give a race to spike is israeli/chinese fate is from singapore and its a major part of her story jet is black/italian  the show notes are detailed as fuck and even inform which parts of the solar system the characters were in and why they were there spike could only be in the syndicate because he was half chinese
  spike is israeli/chinese  fan theories arent facts spikes nationality/race was never ever even brought to attention in the story fuckwad i spit on you
  why does this sounds more like black lagoon
  official scripts databooks and character write ups by the staff are fan theories  nice try faggot
    they can would and have
  you can shove your imaginary papers up your ass you never read them theories  facts    now get out
  dont you mean streaming turd
  i see what you did there  but seriously  if they ditch the whole  everybody has a spaceship side of things  im out
  literally nowhere do they say specify spikes ethnicity
  disgusting
  and you gonna like it
  jewfro  jew name  jewish voice actor  its a goddamn mystery is what it is
  literally nowhere do they specify spikes ethnicity  and therefore hes white and must be played by a white actor
  if you live somwhere free of jews  like latin america you just think hes white with some pillow hairstyle  not jew
  i threw up in my mouth a little
  like latin america    or you know space
  ah  yes  i forgot about the moon nazis  so space should also be 100 jew free
  ah  yes  i forgot about the moon nazis  so space should also be 100 jew free    oh my god you just gave me the nicest thought  most of humanity will leave for space in the future because earth would be a shithole by then  jews stay in their desert shithole because muh promised land and muh zion  no jews in space  i came
  if its accurate and at least passably looks like him its fine judaism is a religion so even a black person can be a jew i fail to see how this is relevant to the point
outlaw star when
  hopefully never whoever thought that hollywood adaptations of anime was a good idea shouldve been lobotomized
  i was talking about that tinfoil hat conspiracy that operation highjump was a coverup to wipe up the last remnants of nazi subs and artic base that got bitchslaped by nazi ufos  but due to lack of human resources they got to a truce  so nazis went to the moon and mars while getting their shit together and trading tech     i wont deny this sounds good too also applies to muslims  remember they have to go see that stupid rock on mecca at least once
  if you really are a stickler for that argument then you should agree that netflix shouldnt push an agenda with casting or any idea of race behind it     if you dont then youre a hypocrite and you just proved your own argument because youll hint your underlying intention
  michael bay should do 08th ms team or something desu
  as long as he get the same photograpy director as dark of the moon  because thats the first trnasformers that you actually know what is happening during the battles without having to put 500 attention on the screen
i honestly cant think of anyone id actually want as spike and im worried its going to be a popular actor from some other netflix/hbo show whos in no way suited to it just to try and draw people in       dane ein  nah corgis are trendy if it were 5 years ago hed probably be a shiba though
      its obviously going to be faye that they black      nearly 11      netflix will try to make it as close to the source material as possible  yeah thats what they said about witcher they lied       fuck off to /pol/
i really wish cowboy bebop never aired on adult swim i seriously sincerely wish cowboy bebop was like nadesico and never aired on american tv then i wouldnt have to hear about it all the time i would have to see an army of spike spiegals every corner at every con even star trek cons i wouldnt have to see it plastered on everything as the greastest anime ever the pinnacle of the medium every time i type in the term anime in a search bar    its worse then dragon ball z atleast people dont make airs about themselves and show how otakulike they are because they watched dbz atleast dbz fan dont pretend pretentious sophistication in their most beloved show and atleast dragon ball z fans have watched a few shows that didnt air on adult swim from 2001 to 2004 and then their ilk dont flood youtube mal and tell me how amazing space fonz and the funky bounty bunch is for the hundredth billionth time ill take the spazziest narutoboy anyday over the katana weilding fedora tipping ootahkuu cb fanboy   now this shows coming around and im gonna have to hear about it again gonna hear more about it and see people talking about it again cant go on fucking /a/ for then next three years i guess
  he doesnt know about jews in space
  atleast dbz fan dont pretend pretentious sophistication in their most beloved show  theres that irish autist on youtube who gets thrown about a lot whos done like 3 videos at this point doing just that shit      the truth is out there
who the fuck keeps paying for liveaction anime adaptions
  michael bay needs to do md geist
  enough people watched death note for it to be getting a sequel so theres definitely a market even if people are just watching it to be able to participate in online discussion    among properties it already owns netflix is developing a sequel to 2017s horrorthriller death note which chief content officer sarandos has called a sizable success with greg russo writing the script
  is the original anime version of death note on netflix i can only assume that normies watched the liveaction adaption because the real thing isnt available on their platform of preference
  it was when i last had netflix about 2 years ago not sure if it still is
    try this on for size instead    we cast keanu in the cowboy bebop live action as vicious
  cumberbatch would make a great bright noa
  well  after jhon wick 2  just shave the man and give him a katana  deal
  living in the post edge of tomorrow timeline i cant ever be sure of the next time the west might actually exceed expectations and do a reasonably good job of adapting a japanese property into live action     granted that was for a light novel rather than anime but i feel the point stands
  i was thinking this as the best choice though id feel hes too expensive to hire for then again they had will smith in an netflix series
  cowboy bebop is an offbrand lupin 3rd with pretty much 1on1 interchangable characters    the show thrived on selfcontained oneshots of which the movie is one    the fsck they wanna do with it    butchering incoming
  you mean the actor must be bame to apply for the role
  you mean the top hitman of the asian underground criminal organization is a jew in the land of white piggu go home country    the fuck are you talking about
id be okay with black jet considering his voice actor is black
  too bad michael clarke duncan is dead
  those writers names    i dunno anon sounds more like cowboy heebop to me
heres the perfect cast niggers dont you me  spike  ryan gosling  jet  dwayne the rock johnson  faye  pom klementieff  ed  insert childactress here  vicious  keanu reeves couldnt have picked a better one myself    though netflix dont have the dough for hiring them with their trashy budget
keanu or fuck off
  jet  dwayne the rock johnson  no the rock will always be a lame comedy actor hes an awful idea for jet
  he has got a german surname
  the capeshit credentials dont inspire any confidence    watanabe being a consultant doesnt mean jackshit too consultants are always ignored and are just used to lure in more fans
first they ruined all of my favorite comics with bad movies and series  move to /m/ stuff since it was comfy scifi  now they are coming for that    i just give up
  obviously
    what is the future what is weird space genre mixing
  soiboi peepoop
  in the land of white piggu go home country
  swap the rock out for dave bautista as jet and itd be fucking perfect
  this but unironically
  oh okay guess dbz needs about 12156 more articles videos esseys and critical analysis on it to add to it wait that drunk mic did a cowboy bebop video as well does that cancel it out does the fact one lunkhead made three sperg video on dbz wipe away the two decades of autismo jizz on the internet talking endlessly on existential woowoo     dont even hate coolboy beepboop think its pretty good but its the poster boy for overrated and its pack of malboros and scotch on the rocks is the only good thing its got furthermore i think its one of the reasons why anime is in the shitty spot it is right now
  yeah but most people here tend to assume or like to meme that everyone with an eastern european surname is like 80 likely to be an ashkenazi jew or have family from that particular eastern european demographic    plus or minus 20 rounded accordingly to how much you want to meme about da joos because lets face it what it really boils down to is just using someone with a name ending in some krautlike mess of begelsteinbergeiseldorfklinger as an opportunity to shitpost about da joos
  i wouldnt mind it at all
dont go full retard with the diversity casting the bebop crew is already pretty culturally diverse as it is  dont try to make cosplay outfits keep them down to earth to fit the tone  get keanu involved somehow since the dudes been trying for over a decade to get a bebop movie made  get kanno and the seatbelts back  follow these simple guidelines and you might have something fans wont immediately hate
  the fact one lunkhead made three sperg video on dbz  3 videos that have had hundreds of thousands of views tens of thousands of likes and a fuck load of people sharing and patting themselves on the back for agreeing with it
  netflix
bebop is literal trash so who cares
  at least its not an amazon original
   like the very same video he did with hundreds of thousands of views 20 thousand likes and a fuck load of people sharing and patting themselves on the back on coolboy boogiewoogy and how smart they are liking it     or wisecracks philosophy video of cb  or souls philosophy video of cb  or criswell philosophy video of cb  or digibros philosophy video of cb  or glass reflections philosophy video of cb  or chris stuckmanns philosophy video of cb   or anime philosophers philosophy video of cb
  the oversaturation of overanalysis has become cringe at this point
  look up surname spiegal out of curiosity  allegedly originated from frankfurts judengasse  i give up reality writes its own jokes
  ike the very same video he did with hundreds of thousands of views 20 thousand likes and a fuck load of people sharing and patting themselves on the back on coolboy boogiewoogy and how smart they are liking it  im not denying cowboy bebop gets the same treatment you dingus im saying literally any anime that aired on cn back in the early2000s gets it because overanalysis of surface level shit to get smart boy stickers is the standard currency of the ironic weeb
  heres the difference though     typical dbz video is dudes punch people super hard thats awesome i wonder if vegeta could have beaten piccolo in the cell arc    typical cb video this show is badass but its not just superficial cool stuff cause i like it and im a smart guy so let me analyze the same three episides that talk about standard existential philosophy from a high school course that every single person has brought up time and time again     the difference is that dbz fanboys tend to accept they like a goofy fun comic book show cb fanboys not so much they tend to think their pulp fiction in space is equivalent to of mice and men in sophistication     again i like the show but the fans are a paradox concerning how up their own asses they are
  i like cowboy bebop but thats okay because im cool  but everybody else who likes it is a dweeb  but im still cool though
  manfaye  i didnt saw this for fourteen years and i was perfectly fine with that
  theres a difference in liking something for what it is and being pretentious about something you love while projecting things that dont fit into it cause you want to wear the big boy pants
  thats a very old cast bebops crew are young adults
  cowboy bebop  live action  netflix  any expectation of it to be decent  i have bad news senpai
everything depends on who they cast as faye    if they cast someone ugly the series will be shit
  uuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhh  im sorry but like how the fuck is 3d gonna compete with faye
  shes gonna be a half caste semi tomboy mutt
  its going to be that one weird looking girl with an afro from riverdale and altered carbon
  faye will definitely have an afro
  shell be black
  the first episode is written by christopher yost thor the dark world and ragnarok  is this meant to be a good thing  they learned from the mistake that was death note  also lol
  please let keanu reeves be the one casted as spike
fucking why  fuck these people
  keep seething whitid
  ed better fucking be a cute brown loli
  funny how saying be anime accurate in a different phrase will trigger your autism    its okay little frog poster spike is canon white
  they were wiped out by the gay niggas from outer space
waito piggus need to keep their hands off of anime
  netflix will try to make it as close to the anime as possible    baaahhahahahhahahha
  keanu or bust man never aged a day since bill and ted so saying hes too old to be spike is a nonissue
  maybe try filtering threads and just not going into discussions about it in the first place
  i can do that with like all of the internet i dont have to listen to how a show airing 20 years ago egging off lupin the 3rd and sam peckinpah movies and considered mostly just okay by the rest of the world but when burgers got their hands on it after all their parents and classmates told them anime is pokemon it was    the quintessential anime considered the best of the medium and the pinnacle of anime much like the godfather is considered the pinnacle of modern filmmaking    some dumb fuck    edit dont you fucking dare tell me no one thinks that about cb cause
  and being pretentious about something you love while projecting things that dont fit  and its special when it happens to bebop instead of literally any other cn anime because
  if 4chan has something magical is that you never know whos reading remember backin teh day when robbin williams turned out to be an anon and posted on /b/  someone here has to know someone on netflix and somehow there has to be a way to get whoever is responsible of this project to get them word of keanu spiegel  this has to happen  social engineering do your magic
    based and redpilled but unironically
  what pretenses no one says dbz is deep adult or philosophically rewarding they tell you its fun and actioned packed yuyu hakusho is action packed with fun characters and cool growth everything bitches about gundam wing nowadays and no one outside of here thinks ggundam is worth 2 shits the show from that block and time that you could analyze rurouni kenshin never does no one even mentions that one anymore its not true every cn show gets a hand up its ass else wed be hearing about how kierkengaard influenced ronin warriors    cowboy bebop is the exception to the rule other then its too cool for school pack of malboros and scotch on the rocks aesthetics being an obviously adult show at a time fans desperately wanted to prove it wasnt just for kids and some small meanderings about existential ennui whats so bloody great about cowboy bebop that i have to hear about it incessently for twenty goddamn years
  americans being obnoxious is not a new development
  pretty much    
  this isnt wrong though twilight of the dark master is pure kino
  really great music for one
  i can do that with like all of the internet    yeah its called turning off the computer
  this also its gorgeous to look at and most of the cast exudes personality from the moment they show up    im not saying that its the most perfect show ever but its not that hard to see why its so popular after 20 years
    she will be as black as the night   she will be as flat as a runway   she will have no curves     but shell be the least of the changes well get someone with zero charisma to play spike probably some strange flavor of tranny to play ed ein will be written out because dogs are hard to work with hell they might just get rid of jet while theyre at it or hell be all cgi
  eh they had real cats play salem in that edgy sabrina show and cats are generally disagreeable bastards
  that anon was probably just looking for an excuse to shitpost about americans  you know how euros are
  im fairly sure that is an american talking about how ggundam and yuyu hakusho aired on cartoon network is a pretty local thing
old thread     how to get into kr and where to start      list of subbed series      direct download links       kamen rider monster compilation      zio episode 14 preview      kamen rider crossz vcinema trailer       rider zio and build heisei generations forever  
  its a nihonneon scrambles to be op thread
bring back 3 legend riders for heisei generations 1  bring back 4 legend riders for heisei generations 2  bring back the imagin and owner for heisei generations 3  why are we experiencing such a downgrade is it because of the budget theyre spending for actors in the show
  we were on page 10
  i gave you 4 hours
do you like gold suits
  tsukasa is coming back for the movie so says the leaks
where does heisei phase 2 end and heisei phase 3 start
  thats still only 1 legend rider and its not even that special since hes going to be featured in zio for quite a few episodes
  april 2019
  yeah  
  bring back  dont want to return    there is always a choice
nadeshiko is cute cute
sht
why is decade so fucking based
looking good guyz
  thats a really nice jougasaki sisters shirt
name one thing geiz did right
  8 to go
  hes pretty good at getting his as beat
  can i get more examples of this based man for research of course
  job to decade
  being gay
  cute feet
  literally just looks like the lead of some edgy metal band not really complaining just saying
  befriended the taka watchroid offscreen that was introduced with no origin as to what its purpose was
always a shame
  i wonder if thats ever be explained
  odin survive vs evol when
  is that ora
  funny i was looking for this specific image ages ago to go down some guys throat on the fact that ghost was 53 episodes and still rushed
  yes
  thats why its so perfect how else would you make a monster version of ghost
  whats it say      how old is she again 14
  shes 19
whats the best ooo combo theme
  basically generally lamenting about lacking time to make certain props or do certain scenes theres a bunch of little excerpts of that specific magazine including a comment on the fact necrom was going to use a fist weapon as an upgrade instead of the gangan catcher but they didnt have the time to make a prop
  time judged all nearly all of the combo themes are great though so its hard to measure them against each other
  necrom was going to use a fist weapon as an upgrade instead of the gangan catcher    so they thought about that but not give a bike to him especially when the other two have bikes
  well the press conference hasnt happened yet so theres still hope it will be bizarre though if they really barely bother getting past actors for that movie they could even have just recorded green screen scenes/voice overs alongside their zio tv appearances
  bikes are expensive dude
  thats even more timeconsuming and expensive especially given how comparatively heavily modded the iguana gostriker and machine hoodie were they really burnt out on dosh for vehicles between drive and ghost to the point we got a whopping three bikes over the next three years and theyve all been relatively light mods
  rather they just give him captain ghost as a form of transport the only thing necrom has is the nimbus cloud in sanzo form
  its hard to match the schedules thats why the actor cameos in zio are so weird they need to compromise heavily in order to work with the actors schedules why do you think dan of all characters was brought back for the another ooo arc why do you think they did fourze and faiz simultaneously
well clear decade with no continues
  but decade has cheat codes
  kamenride black  attackride kingstone flash  bullshits away mutekis muteki
  thats reminds me what happen to taigas actor he vanished from twitter and his agendy erased him from their list
geiz will obtain diends ride watch in the final 2018episode by stealing it from kaito who will have a small cameo role    all zio legend actors will appear in heisei generations in a transform scene and as voice actors decade will appear in flesh    kamen rider plan for after 20th birthday has begun development prime idea is expanding the concept of rider to worldwide in the new era
  that doesnt sound good i wonder if he quit
  decade will appear in flesh  oh good i thought he would astral project to the studio
  agency
  they found out he was doing jav while filming hgf and it was gay jav
  the nipples arent the same
  its not the same nipple   seriously if that real source of the jav
    that would suck taiga was based as fuck
  taiga was based as fuck
  ignoring the other dopes his contract just expired last month    people are wigging about as why on the japside as well but ukyo was never a very communicative person on the topic so dont expect any news from him
  given that weve had absolutely no leaks concerning a diendbased form its probably a weapononly item
  taiga did nothing wrong
decade armor materializes dusting off its hands  zio runs over to kick it  decade armor nonchalantly dodges
  is his agency one of the shittier ones to work for poor guy always looked tired
  i was worried because he deleted his twitter but maybe it was because he dont want to make any explanation
  did his twitter handle have his agency name in it
  no only his name and he can just erase the information about his agency in the description
  which one is emu they arr rook the same
  far left
  emus optimism and will of live gone
always wanted to make this though someone probably already made one
  pretty much i praised ghosts head writer when he was announced cause he wrote some of my favorite jdramas but he could not handle a 50 show i am very sadden to hear about the cancelled ideas ghost had because the head writer could not submit the scripts in time
seeing decade use hibikis finisher makes me happy i hope he uses more of other riders finishers ryuki would be nice actually if anything id like to see more alt form finishers since there are relatively fewer chances to see those
  i am very sadden to hear about the cancelled ideas ghost had because the head writer could not submit the scripts in time  what other ideas was ghost going to have
    fuck it didnt record the whole sequence thats what i get for not checking it after i made it
  woah is that zeron on the far left
  with sentai dying power rangers will die with it so hasbro will need a replacement for power rangers kamen rider may be exactly that       i just hope sougo goes up to it and does decades thing when he uses the final formrides
  this is going to hurt a lot
huh i never noticed it before but it looks like the prop rider cards are made out of paper rather than plastic like the csm ones probably makes them easier to replace theres probably a whole bunch of paper rider cards somewhere in case theyre needed    this explains why masahiro was so impressed by the quality of the csm kamenride decade card in that one video
  i mean they have to be paper or something cheap he was literally throwing them onto the ground when hed transform
  hasbro has about 12 years before they have to make their own original show or beg ishinomori pro to adapt kamen rider only for it them to get rejected or something
  why would you wish that evil on us
preorder for neo decadriver 2nd batch starts today  
  well for first the ghost film was set to be the actual finale with the last ten or so as an epilogue but because fukuda took too long to actually submit his plans on how to end the show the film was filmed before he submitted his plans you can definitely tell demia was supposed to end before the film but hasegawa and mouri had to stall because fukuda couldnt get anything done in time    the other idea is pretty obvious the specter film was meant for tv so yes dalton was planned to be the final boss and not adel    fukuda talked about it more in the ghost novel
  its only been a fucking day are you telling me the first batch is all completely reserved already    how many units were made for the first batch
  there had to have been a good amount since i didnt reserve mine till like half a day after it was put up on the site
come to think of it has ghost ever met decade like even just fighting together in a suitonly crossover role
can someone explain to me the drive and lawsuit and actor availability thing
  what lawsuit
  the closet was chou super hero taisen even then it wasnt even the real versions of them
  so i guess takeru wouldnt react much to decade working with the bad guys even after getting his memories back
  i mean in every single crossover including him hes either teamed up with the bad guys or forcing you to go along with whatever his plans are so it wouldnt be a stretch that he rubs a lot of riders the wrong way
if the ghost ride watch that geiz has is stolen from future oma zio does that mean that sougo will still get a ridewatch from takeru separately  will we get a fight with 5 ghosts at once
  so i guess were getting another drive at some point would be weird if he was the only phase 2 rider to not have a monster but i cant really imagine another drive not just looking like red chase
  kek
  unnphf cant see shit in this costume
  haruto didnt seem to mind rider 1 seemed cool with it too though to be fair i suppose hongo actually likes that kind of thing
the phase 2 riders made an early cameo at the preceding riders summer movie and/or last episodes  drive is the only phase 2 mc to not get an early cameo
  he has to because its a stable loop  takeru and some secondary from drive gives sougo the ridewatches  geiz steals it from oma zio  geiz goes back to the past  takeru and some secondary from drive gives sougo the ridewatches
  too busy shooting minorities
  does that mean that sougo will still get a ridewatch from takeru separately  according to this screenshot yes    will we get a fight with 5 ghosts at once  probably not since the synopsis for episode 14 says that decade destroys geizs ghost ridewatch
  probably not since the synopsis for episode 14 says that decade destroys geizs ghost ridewatch
  probably not since the synopsis for episode 14 says that decade destroys geizs ghost ridewatch  aw that kinda sucks   i was hoping for that level of stupid mayhem when i saw decade as ghost teaming up with another ghost fighting them
  i swear to god hes doing this shit deliberately whats his goal apparently hes just gonna give the decade ridewatch to sougo too
  i was just pretending guys
  decade can you please stop doing this how many times is it now 3 4  5 actually you should get ready for the upcoming future
  dont give me that smug look  you always pull this shit  i swear to god   why the fuck cant i quit you
  decade was oma zios right hand man all along and was sent to fuck up geiz and make sure sougo becomes oma zio in the future
decade is the real oma zio so he can be the destroyer of worlds and time
  but there are screenshots of him beating up zio decade armor he cant possibly be the one to give him the ridewatch
  why cant he no one said he cant beat someone up after giving them a powerup
  gives sougo his power up just to kick his ass to show no matter how strong sougo is decade will always win the end
  looking at the synopsis it said that he gives his ridewatch to geiz who will probably give it to sougo
  kamen rides into hyper muteki and combos it with illusion and clockup
  destroys the ghost ridewatch  geiz is frustrated by this  well dont look so down here ill give you this to make up for it  geiz just gives him an are you fucking serious look  decade just casually walks away
be honest /m/  would you 
this girl is ugly
  spoiler that shit man
  el goblina
futo tantei vol5 special pack comes with dx fang joker ride watch and futo tantei ganbarising card
    gets his ass kicked by decade in episode 13  will get his ass kicked by decade in episode 13  gets the ghost ridewatch destroyed by decade  gets the decade ridewatch by decade as a pity present    being geiz is suffering
  try to used the decade ridewatch  cant use it because hes not waga maou
will the op change next week to reflect decades presence or at the very least will they shoop his driver purple
  how i fucking wish the manga was being translated wtf is gemncorp doing currently btw
  remember that he got his ass kicked by decade twice in a single episode
  thinking tsukuyomi is ugly
place your bets on tsukasa being an agent of oma zio thats there as a training exercise for sougo  i guess breaking geizs spirit is a bonus
  i doubt it decade would never be subservient to someone else
  hell do anything if its fun
    decade is the real oma zio  decade was oma zios right hand man  its just two decades fucking around with everyone
  its two decades who dont know the other person is decade
    20 year anniversary  2 decades running around
  zio is actually decade season 2
    
sougo is a time displaced decade with his memories rewritten
  shirakura joked about how the series was initially going to be called twocade
  oh blessed art thy holy neonness for thou art merciful
if decade really does have a nonsuit role in forever then we can probably assume that hell have stopped pretending to be a villain by episode 15
  that fucking kuuga  god i fucking hate the time mazines why couldnt they choose normal bikes to transport that way they could do bike scenes without breaking the modified bike law
  zio is a prequel to decade and decade is just future amnesiac decade
      dont get me wrong id date her but shes still ugly
grease  tajador combo  build hazard  w fangjoker  why does it feel like bandais picking random ass riders and forms to make dx watches out of
  i like them when theyre actually gold and not piss yellow
  you mean looking like heart lets be real if we get another drive hes going to look like heart but have a car theme instead of a heart theme big old tire shoulders with the sash on his chest being the drive 2014 location instead of the weird horns hed have a spoiler that was stupid large and hell on the suit actors neck as well as the weird another rider eyes
  if hasbro has it instead of saban we might get decent rider toys in the west as well as a decent show if they get the writers from transformers prime or beast wars on it you could see some seriously welldone adaptation of course they could get the 2015 rid writers and make it an absolute mess so its really a coin toss
  one of those is from the previous show and the others are fairly popular upgrade forms its not that surprising is it
  god people really fucking love decade do we know when the ratings for this and the following episodes will be posted
  kang please stop
    what makes you people think hasbro wouldnt just stop adapting anything
  hasbro is just going to invest in a new movie series instead then they wont need to worry about toei supplying them footage
  would taiga be able to fight every other rider to the point where he was the last rider
im so glad seething geiz is now a /krg/ thing im so glad i persisted in the beginning
  nah  he couldnt even beat the other riders in his own show
what the fuck is going on with schwartz in the 5
  true but what if he could actually use chronos
if tsukuyomi is the ugliest heisei girl who is the prettiest
  he old
  ruka
  then muteki would still fuck his shit up
  decade girl
does anyone have a good pic of zio second im mostly looking for one with a good shot of the arms and legs
  something about him being a zealous stage actor also a few jokes about his catchphrase of which i didnt realize was a catchphrase until then
so /m/ what would be the best and worst rider worlds to live in for worst id say  faiz  deathtrap world orphenochs break down and die humans with orphenoch dna break down and die normal humans get killed by orphenochs all the time  ryuki  every reflective surface around you could be your death at any moment being chosen by kanzaki means you either die fighting other riders or get eaten if you refuse  kuuga  the person sitting next to you on the train could be a gurongi about to massacre you and everyone else on it  gaim  planetary devastation either you get killed by the invess or eat a fruit and become one yourself or get a driver and either lose your humanity or get mindbroken     best worlds to be in  ooo  the greeed dont really kill anyone spawning a yummy doesnt lead to your death overall very safe  exaid  you can be revived even if you get killed by the villains stakes are as low as they can get  blade  the undead arent really out to kill people theyre out to win the battle fight so its mostly undead vs undead or undead vs riders youre mostly safe unless youre handpicked to be a rider yourself
  agito be bad too you could be shoved into a tree or something
  best  fourze  all the zodiart shenanigans are only in one high school and even if you go there you get to be gentaros friend    worst  build  youre just minding your own business in your broken war torn country when evolt just fuckin sucks you into a black hole
  best  hibiki  worst  gaim
  you can be revived even if you get killed by the villains  if youre not someone plot important it takes years for that to happen in which time your entire life has been completely derailed your friends/family could be dead in ways that they wont get magicscienced back to life your significant other if you have one probably moved on your job gone student instead well thats all fucked up too because youre not enrolled anymore and all your classmates have graduated already so socially youre starting from scratch your house probably gone too and if you were renting/living alone all your shits probably gone as well unless you have friends or family that stepped in to save it    in summary yeah youre not dead but your lifes ruined its kind of like waking up years later from a coma except your bodys not fucked up
  the undead arent really out to kill people     thats because they eat them they show that all the time in that show    the real worst world to live in is agito since on top of the lords stuffing unlucky people in tree trunks theres a 1 in 12 chance you and a half billion people all over the world will die in a freak event
  you can be revived even if you get killed by the villains  yeah but you lose your humanity and turned into a walking disease that doesnt sound good at all
  kamen rider sure is antitranshumanist     bugsters are immortal   almost 100 immune to disease    literally better than being human
what would you do if the series after zio is an absolute 10/10 and beloved by everyone    but magenta comes back to sub it
      the only real answer to this question is hibiki    all the riders are nice and friendly   you get some cool powers with no harmful side effects  all the monsters live the mountains   you get a free upgrade in the summer
what was hibikis upgrade
  kurenai the form he got by training in the summer
  ooo  remember when the dinosaur yummy killed the entire people on a department store
  sweet innocent gamel has the highest kill count of all the greeed too he straight up turning people into piles of medal in his final scene
  i like how nonsenical lords method of killing is one that i remember is when a lord dragged someone to the top of a multistorey building drop them make the victim phase through the building floor then stopped the phasing in the middle stoey because why the fuck not
  isnt that just a cheap redeco
  nice feet
  blade  youre mostly safe  unless human undead is the winner again or another miracle happens again mankind is fucking doomed the moment the fights broke out
  is that her jav
is there such a thing as bench undead
    shut up lukeraymen
we need an american adaption of kamen rider drive
  aid  you can be revived even if you get killed by the villains stakes are as low as they can get    why didnt you just skip this one since you obviously didnt watch the show
  have there been any good foreign adaptations lately off the top of my head the only thing i can think of is battle angel
  the gits movie
  speed racer
  dragonball evolution
whats up with kuugas crusher mouth in the ride watch art why is it clear in the center was his mouth always supposed to look like that
      so thats a big fat no then
  the power rangers movie
  death note
  oldboy stormpiercer
  edge of tomorrow
  does giving someone a powerup then beating them up really sounds outofcharacter for tsukasa to you
  i thought power rangers was an okay cw tv pilot until they turned into power rangers
  the power rangers movie is surprisingly good too bad it flopped
  imo it wouldve been better if they did them as a whole new team/villain instead of making them new versions of the mmpr team  rita    so many folks were peeved because notmuh ______
      the krispy kreme product placement in the movie worked i never wanted a donut so bad until after i saw that movie
  
  just looked him and     does he legitimately have autism
  wizard made me want try plain sugar but i could never find a place that sold them i found some at the gas station near my university and theyve probably become my favorite flavor of donut
  alain made me want to try takoyaki and holy shit why is it so good
  probably because you are a jobber
  how is kabuto not the worst world worm are light speed mimics that perfectly copy anyone they want anyone you know could be a worm at any time they always kill the original as well and if the original gets away they just hunt them down most of them dont even seem to have a goal they just want to be dicks
did get the old decadriver voice over to do the later forms
  apparently fucking up skyrider under a different name the new skyrider batch was a collab between them and some unknowns all it was was a kitsub scrub but very poorly edit and encoded its fucking laughable
  yup
  its pancake batter made from potatoes stuffed with octopus its my drug whenever im feeling suicidal too
pick your fighter
  why does faiz look like another faiz
  that kiva is probably what another kiva is going to look like
  blades face is not piss stained  one job  i really like that fourzes rocket though
  agito looks like he has wizard helmets for kneecaps
all the final forms
trying to learn new skills and to eventually travel the world has become my reason for living ive went from being a neet who only knows how to masturbate and cry himself to sleep to someone who has learned the basics of 44 different skills and has mastered roughly 6 of them and has actual selfconfidence among other things     tldr kuuga cured my depression
  thats cool dude
  nice
  youll fail go back to where you started from and then give in to despair and become a phantom
    fuck knows im actually slightly worried because she lives in spain now and apparently hes heading to spain for a holiday next year
only a couple of days until we hear all the sounds from the decade ridewatch and the heisaber    wednesday/thursday can not come fast enough
    jesus christ what did i just read
    thats all he ever posts i only found him because he was shitting up toku actors instagrams
  thats fucking disturbing this is why i refuse to acknowledge people ive met at cons who are into toku cause there seems to be more chrischans than passably normal people into all of this
  its a childrens show its a childrens show from a different country of course its going to be mostly autists that like it and if it isnt autists then we get the mentally ill crowd too
  i got the big bundle on the way very happy to pretend i care about the ridewatches
think therell be a 3rd release for the neo decadriver i got mine in the first round but im surprised it sold out within a single day
  deno devito  kek
  im not seeing a problem here
avoid build    it is the worst kamen rider show bar none its just a complete package shitposters will say it isnt but i have been watching kamen rider for over many years now and i can assure you it is    build does everything all other rider series did but does it even worse for example early heisei rider series had amazing designs and a more mature feel but most of them lacked in writing pacing and fights    neoheisei series have gottan a lot better in those areas for the most part you still had cool shows like ghost  shows like gaim and exaid have pointless talking going nowhere lacks monsters of the week with soso fights but they forgot what made early heisei likeable in the process which was the cool designs for the most part    build takes these things and merges the worst together so you have a main rider with an bleh suit a horrific story that has random progression and pacing each episode forgetting onto the one prior constant babble that leads nowherre like no other series ever did boring fights some of them span an entire episode not even kidding you even have a tournament arc in the middle with 3 backtoback fights that spans a total of three episodes of pure fighting that somehow sucks ass it even has references to showa series in some of the story bits for furthers insults    build is just too fucking awful thankfully other rider series will never be this bad
  maybe hasbro can handle making their own series and have plex making sentailike suits
  based and redbuild
  there is nothing unusual about it being sold out almost immediately it has a very limited stock for first edition release and this has happened to the other premium belt drivers and premium action figures always
  crt is trying to kill himself
  i like builds suit its sort of a back to basics style design after years of experimentation especially after exaid who looks nothing like what youd normally consider a kamen rider
  thats dumb theyre dumb
  premium
  its literally a recolored dx decadriver with added sounds
i dunno why you guys are surprised this even happened when people were saying it was gonna happen with the decadriver even before zio aired
  hello welcome to pbandai newfriend enjoy your stay
  yes and they still want to slap that p word to the toyline and sell them at the highest price markup so there you have it enjoy your jewbandai newfriend
  koyomehhhh megumi or yui  easy
  blade  undead dont kill people  the centipede undead straight up slaughters a bus full of school children
  and yet youre still posting here
  goth girl
        there are people who dont think that miitan is best and prettiest girl
  miitan is the 4th for me
  now you know why kouta wanted to conquer that ass
  lewds where
  are most worms even sapient i was always under the impression that most of them were acting under animallike instinct and only a few had fullon human level intellect
this jobber is the hero we are stuck with for rider series 2068  nobody can say geiz is the real protagonist now
  hey they cant all be banjou
  implying zio wont end with the future being changed so that geiz is never born
would you prefer a rider who gets all the gritty backstory fully out of the way presented at the beginning or just gets that stored for later character development to justify his lack thereof in the beginning  referring mostly to geiz because whatever his rebellion backstory from the future was like i dont think itll ever justify his current character
  i mean sougo doesnt have much to him either in the way of history im fine with backstory being gradually told throughout the story but it does need to be mostly filled in at least by the halfway point when it comes to shit like this imo
  see thats a big thing kabuto never really confirmed the higher ranked worm seem to have intelligence beyond instinct some of the lower tier worm seem to as well and do things you wouldnt expect them to do when they mimic people some of them have goals and break away from the person theyre mimicking worm are really fascinating and need more lore
  best  fourzes antics are confined to one high school very few zodiarts kill anyone and gentaros a cool guy    wizard has phantoms who usually wont do anything to you if youre not a gate and even if you are a gate you can survive the experience of getting tormented and get the ability to use magic    drive only has exactly 108 roidmudes and theyre mostly confined to one city    worst  gaim has at least three different groups trying to kill everyone on the planet with a high chance of succeeding cracks could open anywhere at any time its very hard to resist the temptation to eat one of the fruits if you dont have a driver to protect you    builds villain wants to suck your planet into a black hole builds hero wants to crash it into another planet
  ghosts biggest threat is that takeru cant eat dinner
  ghost has fifteen invincible outofcontrol golems that eventually plan to rip everyones souls out of their bodies and only lose because they make the mistake of forming their own grateful knockoff this is the third worldending threat after the previous villains plan to turn everyone into a clone of him and the movie villains plan to crash a giant meteor into the planet and kill everyone i should actually have put it on my worst list
  what even was the ganmas big masterplan supposed to be before adel went fuck you dad and tried to make the worlds biggest selfcest orgy
  her voice is really cute and distinctive though she should do voice acting
  drive only has exactly 108 roidmudes and theyre mostly confined to one city  they were world wide after the first global freeze a large portion of the roidmudes were summoned back to japan  if not for protodrive going around and beating them up the entire world would have been victim to mass slow down and constant murders
  you know you should actually watch all of the shows before making a post like this
  drive only has exactly 108 roidmudes and theyre mostly confined to one city  literally terminators level of threat
17043508  cool shows like ghost  gaim and exaid have pointless talking going nowhere lacks monsters of the week with soso fights  woah youre a fucking retard and im not even going to read the rest of your tripe i cant wait for it to be the hot new copypasta
  that guy is an autist but build was pretty trash
  english motherfucker
  yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
  shes not the ugliest heisei girl  also medics actress is in a completely different league to the rest of them in my opinion
  that kiva
i havent really watched kamen rider but can anyone tell me if its okay to start with drive
zio decade armors gonna job to decade  has an upgrade ever jobbed so quickly after its debut before
  yeah drive is a pretty good starting place
  sure thats fine if you like it try w and fourze which are by a lot of the same production staff
  yes then try wizard and ghost afterward
  rabbitrabbit
  that was kinda despicable
rouze cards  rider cards  advent cards
  fuck off daffy its duck season
  wonder if theyll ever do barcode scanner cards again
  its gonna be interesting seeing how decade deals with the decade armors different forms the only time hes dealt with a super form was dogabaki and he lost that fight pretty badly id have a hard time believing decade could beat grateful or mbxx with just base forms only upgraded form hes ever used was axel though he does have a wing form card
    necrom in the specter movie
  this one literally jobbed in the same episode it got upgraded
  kuugas upgrade literally jobbed in the same episode
  dragon form looks shittier than i remember
  the nonrising kuuga forms were pretty shit except for titan and mighty
  redditspacing
      is it really jobbing if theres a reason why to it lost
  alright alright just take your you already damn
  rebirth is a jobber  uh nuh its not its built for supporting not for solo combat  necrom is a jobber  uh nuh its not he got a real body now so he isnt to be blamed   jobber is a jobber nonetheless
  the entire plot of ghost is edith trying to find a way to circumvent the ganmeizers so that he can get access to the great eye and fix the flaws in the capsule system thatre causing people to spontaneously disintegrate takerus wish was supposed to accomplish this somehow before he botched it by wishing kanon back instead maybe something in the ghost driver would have activated if hed wished for himself but they never explicitly state that
  what the fuck is rebirth    necrom  that doesnt count all third riders are jobbers besides todoroki and chaser
  stop forcing this fucking meme
  its an sic thing i think
  well he didnt even know there are capsules in the first place anyway
  rebirth   you mean birthday form right   i havent watched ooo since it aired but birthday form didnt job at all it was only used in one episode too i think
  so why is alain treated as the almighty jobber but not kuroto the rider who somehow wasted 99 lives and was losing even before that with the only saving grace was his zombie ability
  i think itll be more a close match rather than outright jobbing
  because many of kurotos deaths werent losses at all they just started spamming his death to go ahead with the countdown attacks that just push the others outright kill him but when theyre attacking he did just as well as the others aside from muteki
  many of kurotos deaths werent losses at all  so bacially it doesnt count   theyre attacking he did just as well as the others   yeah just like necrom grease and all the other jobber riders
  the autists protect us good honest people from the mentally ill social justice pedophiles that dominate anything that isnt safeguarded by nonfunctioning autists  and many things that are
  ratings shot up 18 compared to the previous episode
  build arc has the highest rating  yabei
  1st episode has the highest rating  oh no who could have guessed
  neoheisei series   you
  same energy
    youre talking bullshit go get some sleep
  if hasbro takes kamen rider we will have figures like the rkf series even cheaper if the toys sells well habro will take the franchise and maybe we can have a decent adaptation but it will hut to have a belt with some bad dub english sounds
  at least 70 of kurotos death is him just bragging overworking himself to death or part of an experiment to create gamedeus cure    it hardly counts
  you have to remember that prerevival kuroto intentionally let himself received lethal damage so that he can create level x    you also need to remember the numerous time that alain try to do a supposedly suicide attack that never appeared
    which one of you is the another rider
  objectively gatakiriba   its so strong it goes meta and kills the budget
decade gives sougo his upgrade just to beat him up in that form to show no matter how strong sougo is decade will always win in the end
  even uhr and woz look like better girls than tsukiyomi  
hey wait a second    tsukasa no
  overworking himself to death so many times in such a short period  so i guess he used to have some degree of common sense once upon a time
  formride decade armor
  they are all equally amazing but gotta keep it real is the most equally amazing of them all
  formride decade arms  formride decade damashii  formride decade gamer  formride cameracard
  i personally find gotta keep it real to be the least memorable i can remember the complete melodies to every other ooo song except that one i only consistently remember the chorus
  nadeshiko or hina you cant dispute this
  ooo  isnt ooo only second to gaim build doesnt count for death counts
just watched the amazons movie it was great overall by why the fuck is one of the amazonz an ewok    id also had like if jin had saw both nanahas and chihiros spirit before dying
  build doesnt count  why evolt was blackholing people left and right in the final episodes and thats without counting the war and the pandora tower rising
so guys what do i need to watch if i want to understand jinga
so now that decade can transform into phase 2 riders lets analyze the implications of this  w can transform into w without needing two people can use fangjoker much more easily for the same reason  ooo can probably use combos without penalties  wizard can probably use wizards power with impunity as hes not reliant on mana  gaim can theoretically use any lockseeds power including those that werent usually in gaims possession as long as gaims used a particular form before decade should be able to use it too not that theyd take advantage of this   drive doesnt need beltsan nearby to transform  ghost can eat dinner  exaid doesnt need parad to access mutekis power assuming theres a neo complete form as well also probably wont go berserk if he uses dragoknight hunter  build doesnt have to destroy any worlds
  gatakiridecade  create a kabuto army
kamen rider g armor
  squirrel amazons  cute
  theres actually a pretty good chance toei just gave that suit to that guy
  its like they forgot chihiro existed
  when she literally tells haruka to eat her
  so did he eat all of her or just like part of her its not necessary to eat all of her right
  use gatakiriba  illusion  invisible  clock up  final attack ride
  well since parts of her are still left i imagine he only ate part of her neck to kill her as quickly as possible god mizuki was fucking hot in this movie too
  probably not even common amazons cant eat a whole person at once and save some of the meat inside the refrigerator
  jin mentions that those kids are like his son thats all we got about chihiro in the entire movie
    couldnt he have just eaten an arm or something
  she was going to die anyway
      implying jin cares
how are there even any amazons left
  anon she was dying might as well put her down as quick as haruka can
  tachibana made more to replace cows as livestock    what i dont understand is if the amazon cells are so versatile could he recreate them in a not humanoid form i dont think that most people would be fine eating meat from beings that look exactly like human beings
      edge of tomorrow was the only good one also ringu
  he cares enough to save him from having the most miserable existence possible
  kamen rider shitposter and another shitposter
  he did
  pls respond
  edge of tomorrow too bad they didnt go the original route would have liked the coffee scene even if the two of them didnt fight
so what is this ginganen thing i mean at first glance it seems to be a channel dedicated to stalking masahiro but it also seems to heavily advertise fang of god but the last half dozen videos have been pretty much primarily about decade so its not technically connected to fang of gods production is it just a channel that exists to stalk masahiro
  didnt they look human because their original marker was jin
  its a fang of god/garo channel they just hosted twitter qnas and decade reappearing in jiou just happened to be the hot thing at the moment
they bring back ankh in heisei generations forever just to kill him off again
  is that allowed isnt that almost like advertising for an unrelated production
downloaded gorgom subs for the amazons movie deleting it straight away because the subs are all wrong and inaccurate like not even debatable inaccurate just outright wrong and worse than tvnihon much much worse    who the fuck worked on this sub
  really give some examples they must be horrendously bad if someone who needs subs can realize how bad they are im curious but not curious enough to download the thing myself
  its more of a fanclub thing than an official one and its not like its all about decade most of the questions are like between decade and jinga who can kill more people etc
  didnt decade inadvertently kill at least 63 billion people
  haruka near the beginning says  i want to be able to be part of a family too  its translated as i miss the old days    i think the part that made me just delete it was when a guy introduces himself and    pardon me / sorry about that translated to yes you are    im the manager mido is translated to are you running away
  that not even a guess sub anymore in order for that to happen youd need to have absolutely zero understanding of the japanese language im talking less than the average /a/fags i watched subbed anime and thus i am now an expert on nihongo kawaii desu chan     are you sure this gorgom isnt a meme sub group
  either they are or theyre pulling shit out their ass
  you missed the line about why they are serving them as food while the amazons are still children  there was a line saying when the amazons will change when they are no longer pure people are pay big bucks to eat children
  i only watched 11 minutes in grammatical errors and completely erroneous translations all over the place and thats only 11 minutes in
decade travels the nine worlds in his series  its possible the events of each one takes place during the year of the original broadcast  decade travels between the worlds out of order during his journey  does this make decade a time traveler
  trusting gorgom
  were all time travellers anon
  awn za lode
  now over quaaaaaaaartzer
  mirai
  ywn go over quartzer
wake up burning  wheres the subs
  good id rather journey through the decade
  id rather ride through the next decade alive
  no need to think so hard about this he outright went from kuugas world to agitos world where g3x was already developed because no4 has been missing for two years
  not the best person to answer your question but i deduce that since they got an actor established as one of the faces of a franchise from the same genre theyd expect people not into garo to watch jinga out of curiosity because theyre fans of decade and thus make the spinoff about him friendly for newcomers
decade can use neo decadriver to transform into postw riders  neoheisei is now official
      go to the fuckin garo/jinga thread
  nah its 二期平成
anyone know where i can get my hands on the super hero wars ost the original one i think it might have the slower version of decades theme we hear in later super hero wars movies the one that plays when they use the goseiger cards but its not in the ost mega or the pastebin
  never mind its listed as fourze super hero taisen instead of just super hero taisen thats fuckin dumb since fourze was in like 2 or 3 super hero wars movies wasnt he
  bare minimum  yamitera gold storm  movie fang of god movie then jinga ideally you get through the kougaverse first series til sokouku no maryu movie first since its where the lore and world of garo is mostly established
    also if youre interested in which track it is its listed as super battle the decade bit kicks in at the last third and is a great rendition of decades theme
  arent these pretty good for rider these days
  given the blurays and dvds also fly off the store shelves yes
is type formula faster than clock up clock up seems to be limited on sudden bursts only and kabuto still need the kabuto extender to chase off a worm
   can eat dinner  the opposite is also true  amazon omega can skip dinner    he can use maximum mighty x to reprogram genes  complete form can summon genius without giving a fuck if sento is feeling hatred or not  iirc ghost can use some stupidly overpowered gravity magnets if he uses grateful then he can overwhelm the opponent with spirits while its pinned down by magnets  thats as far as my knowledge goes
hell no dude i see you on this fucking corner every fucking day you think im gonna give fucking you think im gonna give you some fucking riderwatches fuck you you fucking dumpster baby alright fuck you
  seething
theres a dx fangjoker ride watch  you have to get the w manga to get it    fuck
so what happens when we get to agito
  we dont
id rather jumping hard until i climax
godai now works with the police and gives them kuugas data to build g3  ichijou got locked up by the police for special treatment  sachis corpse is also taken by the police for experiments head is still missing godai is going to find that out very soon  the holy fountain is drying up fast    wild ride incoming
  if the another riders continue im pretty sure theyll be based on upgraded forms rather than base since zio now has access to them
  he only appears with his actor on screen in sht his actor voices him in shtz but his appearance there was kind of wasted he appears out of nowhere right before the final battle alongside the other space heroes and decade and then briefly teams up with the new inazuman then he also goes to the final battle itself but there he just gets beaten up over and over again    in all other movies hes a suitonly rider with a replacement va although he does get a couple of scenes in krt in spite of that
  theyre aus they all took place in the present not at the time of the original serie if you look at stuff like the dates in ryukis newspapers
  yes but only because of the onigashima movie and its shenanigans
love how over time subs rider last
  i mean look at their name
gdi crapcom pls bring back dire miralis
  oops wrong thread
why the fk does over time take so much fking long to sub zio they fking sub fking sentai first like what the fking hell
  im pretty sure ignis is suffering from the same thing he did with ghost where he is being held at gunpoint to sub a series he hates
  this killed me anon
  i wouldnt say no to this pretty feminine face the guy who fucks his boipussy must be the happiest man alive
  guess ot wont sub rider next year then
whats the deal with schwartz in 125 he acts like a retard is that a reference or something
    
previous thread     links for beginners  ddl        list of subbed series        super hero time osts       super sentai monster designs  gorenger  zyuohger      monster and robot sentai design art books      do not make new generals when it immediately reaches bump limit wait till it gets to page 6 to make a new general mod rules
lvp cant end soon enough
saw this over on 420/wooo/ in a discussion of the horrors of japanese pizza
  its almost like the writings deliberately antagonising the pats didnt help the ratings
the cops really dont need any powerups since the arsenal they have now is good enough for killing
  wow we actually filled a thread huh
so i havent catched up this year but lupat seems to be doing pretty bad   what happened how did they waste all those concepts and designs
  same writer as zyuohger who just sits on her hands
  and utsunomiya as producer who just allows it
  hyping up the two teams gimmick while making the toyline favor one team too much
he just lives outside the studio
  even zyuohger had the shit with bunglay and the world when he was evil for like two episodes lupat has none of that
  lupat is enjoyable unlike zyuoh that had a gokai crossover to make up for the lackluster season
  he looks hobotastic
  its gonna be sad when sentai gets canceled and we wont be able to see him anymore
  lvp is very boring
  thats every sentai after toqger except lvp
   implying he wont try to get into the space squad movies
  
  for all the problems kyuranger had it certainly wasnt boring
spada and touma better have a cooking battle in the crossover movie
how likely patranger keeping siren striker later on
why do they think dinosaur motif will sell good the only dinosaur sentai which was a big hit on sales is kyoryuger and i dont think its simply just because of the dinosaur theme
if sentai skips a year can we have a reboot of supaidaman fill in the timeslot
  just play the ps4 version
  its still popular in china
  honestly this looks like the final 5person lineup
  thats too good for this sinful earth
  i think this is more an utsunomiya problem than a komura problem because this happens in basically all of his shows
    huh no zyuranger132 billion yens was a huge hit similar to kyoryuger there is a reason 6th rangers and animal mecha immediately became staples of super sentai abaranger hit similar numbers too 13 billion yens    dinosaur is the one theme that has never failed them even before ninninger kakuranger had fairly low numbers too so ninja were never reliable in spite of being a recurring theme
  lvp is probably the show where he went hardest with it though    usually in his series theres a midseason villain to keep some kind of event happening midway through the series even if that villain is killed off before the final arc and often is unrelated to the main plot  see akumaro in shinkenger basco in gokaiger or bunglay in zyuohger lupin vs pat somehow didnt even have that the mid season villains this time got killed off right after their debut
  fuck i almost forgot lymon even existed
  me too
  i suspect zamigo was going to fill that role more but something has happened behind the scenes his appearances in the show before now were so bizarrely scarce that i suspect something mustve been up
  ah fuck these have been posted already havent they worth doing it again i suppose
pats power up soon
  who is that guy am i missing something
    the original pat 2 who got injured before the series started
  patren 2 crane arm siren patkaiser and satoru appearing is likely episode episode 43 cause hes the titular man who came back
   2 firing lupin xs cannons    gay
  when noel was a child he met lupin and was saved by him  they lived together and he was taught how to modify the collection  but dogranio appeared stole the collection and killed lupin  noel was told by lupin that bringing the collection together could grant any wish so he began to fight  presumably revealed in episode 44
  pretty weak modus operandi imo
  they probably should not have waited this damn long
make a boring uneven show with multiple rewriters and uncertain direction  make shitty toys that wont pass as cool even for an infant  why are we losing money guys quick roll out dinosaurs  john toei
  its almost like the writings deliberately antagonising the pats didnt help the ratings  thanks for proving my point once again patfag
i was expecting samurai to be next since shinkenger would be 10 years old dinosaurs are a sure hit but after the recent slide will that really fix things in the long run they need to restructure the shows
  allow me to be devils advocate then what have the lupins done wrong in your eyes since you seem to only heap onto the pats
  abaranger is pretty unpopular though
  and often is unrelated to the main plot  basco in gokaiger    technically you can say that basco was more related to the main plot than the zangyack basco main objective was getting the grand powers to the get the greatest treasure in the universe that the gokaigers was seeking also     while basco had the occasional help by the zangyack through damaras they was oblivious throughout the series as to what the gokaigers was after
  allow me to be devils advocate then what have the lupins done wrong in your eyes since you seem to only heap onto the pats  well first this isnt you playing devils advocate this is you forcing me to play devils afvocate i mean yes theyre thieves and outlaws but thats how theyre designed and they play the part while still being able to be portrayed as heroes given that their only victims are the monsters of the season thats the point its really hard to say the lupins have done wrong when the reality is their the only ones playing their parts the police arent real police they dont do any real police work or approach fighting monsters as police would theyre just the generic sentai team of the season   thats the contention that i have people in these threads point at lupins kairi and noel for the problems holding back the season ie the weak story telling and slowed pace when really all that is more the polices fault considering the vast majority of filler episodes are the police centered ones
  wow its almost like the writing is shitty and never gave the police decent material patrangers at this point remind me of yuuseless from decade except that guy somehow has some point near the end
  thats not a him thing though thats a sentai thing they almost always introduce a mid series villain to spice things up
  this whole show felt like nge where gendo just want to reunite with his stupid wife the question remains if the collections only grant one wish or more
  because kyoryuger has been the season with the best selling toyline since gokaiger and every other season after hasnt been able to reach its heights more like selling less and less every year with minor bumps up dinosaurs just seem to make bank so having the next season themed around dragons which could technically be seen as dinosaurs is a pretty sound move
  youve kinda described the problem the narratives stacked the deck so hard in the lupins favor that all conflict is basically pointless noel basically cemented this
  the midseason villain in sentai traditionally replaces a defeated early general or even takes over as the main villain though in his series these midseason villains are basically sidestories that then get shoved aside for the final arc after buying enough time since any payoff for the core premise/conflict is kept for the final arc
  the midseason villain in sentai traditionally replaces a defeated early general or even takes over as the main villain though  not really   mega change mask five car shinken goon all have mid series villains that dont replace someone or take over as main villain
  in cases like changeman and maskman the new general just stays there alongside the existing ones up to the ending though so its still different from what we get in utsunomiyas series     hiramechimedes from goonger is very similar to the utsunomiya style though but it takes place earlier than usual and the main villain eventually does end up killed off and replaced just much later into the show  with several one off replacements in two episode arcs before the actual final villain appear for the first time    and shinkenger is an utsunomiya series in the first place
  the only sentai with one writer is kyoryuger i really dont think anyone wants another show like that
  unpopular where it sold well and had great tv ratings
  wheres its 10ya then
  ranrus actress is retired and presumably didnt want to come back thats why she wasnt in kyoryu vs gobus
  in cases like changeman and maskman the new general just stays there alongside the existing ones up to the ending though  yeah they dont replace them
  the same place as boukengers if they cant get all of the cast together they cant make a 10ya the hurricanger dekaranger and goonger casts are friends in real life magigreen doesnt get along with the rest of his cast so they couldnt do magi boukenblack had a terrible experience with fans so he wouldnt come back if asked shinkenger may not get one because shinkenred didnt enjoy his time on the show since were getting dinosaurs again i have to wonder whats going to happen with the kyoryuger cast they came back earlier this year but pink retired a few months ago
  wow its almost like the writing is shitty and never gave the police decent material   i dont totally disagree but like i said for most anons their response has been to put the blame entirely on the lupinrangers for the bad things happening instead of the patrangers which is fucking stupid why blame the one team actually doing what they promised      youve kinda described the problem the narratives stacked the deck so hard in the lupins favor that all conflict is basically pointless noel basically cemented this  again i wont pretend this season is perfect but its just not as bad as most people make it out to be anon was better off asking me what i actually liked from the cops because believe it or not there are some things ive liked from them hell even if it cemented the lupins getting the toys the splash episode was great for both reds and keichero in particular
  most of the gokai cameo rangers were retired and i thought one or two of the goons were as well if theyre close with the casts still/get paid enough/care about the sentai brand some people can be convinced to come back
ive only watched a handful of lvp episodes and didnt see anything that was particularly shitty at least nothing out of the ordinary what happens in the show thats pissing people off
  toei clearly does
  and thats why this series is being driven into the ground
came up with a sentai vs sentai premise and somehow made it bland as fuck  have to reuse a theme 6 years after the last show that used it ended  some random intern reveals it to the entire internet    oh no no no no no
kyuranger space  lupinranger air  patranger land  ryuusouger water  what will be next in line
  poverty line
  tsukasa dropkicking gouche  sweet
  knees arent red  patkaiser   woah
  what happens in the show thats pissing people off    nothing
  holy shit its been a while since ive seen patkaiser
  is satoru going to become patren 0
  its a show about nothing
    but what kind of nothing i remember being bored by ninninger because nothing was happening
  kinda like zyuohger the main villains dont really do much just sit in their spaceship casino or in lupats case their mansion dining room and just talk about about things before letting another motw do its thing its just very very slow but this is also coming from a person that really liked zyuohger and is pretty much enjoying lupat though i really wanna see those ryusouger toy catalog leaks already
  i think what made people really upset is because its a lot of wasted potential  it had some good ideas but the show doesnt do much with it  its not a terrible show i find it a good show but the problem is that they dont do much with it  i really wish the villians were more present in show    same here
  the villains barely do anything the vs aspect of the show feels superflous considering the writing and toys more or less favor the lupinrangers and a whole lot of wasted potential in general
    you mean lupinkaiser patren
  vs aspect of the show feels superflous considering the writing and toys more or less favor the lupinrangers  show shouldve been called kaitou sentai lupinranger feat keisatsu sentai patranger
  more like yawn sentai boringranger ft who sentai siderangers
  nono lupinkaiser has red shins
i was so happy to see jingi get another role in toku after kikaider reboot bombed but in the end he ended up playing a nothing character
  see was this so hard toei
  magiranger makes me really nostalgic
well they werent wrong
    they look like chinese toku mechas
  becasue they are        nice try
  kek
      thats a shame cause they look fucking cool
if sentai is dead then whats going to happen to ryusouger
  swan song    lets hope its good
  its going to be retooled at the first sign of not making any improvements to the income and those retools will kill it even faster
ive been saying for years super sentai needs a nap did wonders for kamen rider
  nothing it will air as normal unless the toys are garbage again even ninninger didnt get hit with the retool hammer like lupat did so unless ryusou doesnt improve at all over its predecessor it should be fine
  lupat  retooled    what
  based on toy catalogs its pretty clear that they intended to give more toys to the pats that and the huge absence of zamigo from most of the show scream retool to me
  lupins started getting every cool new toy while pats got to sit in the corner for being unpopular
  it was like that from the beginning
  even the ones with the pats logo on them
  the lupins arent allowed to fail or even struggle the pats arent allowed to advance in ability or narrative importance and the ganglar have no plan or even sense of fucking presence
what would you want to see from ryusouger not just for it to be good but more nitty gritty colors gender ratio style of robot op singeretc
    i still hope sentai can get one jam project opening
  a new nob opening would be goat
  my bad meant lupinkaiser patren  silver shin mode
  sentai will probably get a song done by one of the ims cg vas since columbia is involved in both psychic lover did a song for cinderella girls
  another male yellow just to mess with the kyoryu retard
  that and male yellows are the best
    i think the real thing that hurts no completely kills lupat is that its a series that shouldnt be humping the status quo zyuohger was typical sentai so it wasnt a big deal but lupat its tried to bill itself as a year long vs series while asking the audience to pick a side in theory it should be making us want to cheer for two kickass teams as to make it all the more glorious when they finally put aside their differences and kick the final bosses ass     but instead the show promotes the lupins above everything else they will steal every treasure without fail the pats cannot open the safe nor do they claim the collection pieces for themselves likewise the pats cannot advance in their investigations into the lupins until the very end if they ever do find out so theyre stuck sitting around with their thumb up their asses which kills the tension in another way there is no danger for the lupins whatsoever
  as much i am team lupin i really really hope patranger keeps siren striker and possibly getting a few more new toys
  wat
  i feel the same way ive been wanting a series that had a year long confrontation between two sentai for years now and fucking utsunomiya thought it was a good idea to have things play out like he usually does even from the start you had people show more interest in the lupins because their base story felt more thought out though that ended up being a flop too
  worst part is that noels shtick as an undercover agent could have been a really nice way to delve deeper into the conflict and show how the cops are trying to learn more about the thieves and the whole collection situation but nope he just fucking knew who they were from the beginning and if anything was just a mole for them while he tells the cops to basically eat shit
  garo style armors
  you think they would have done something right now with the fact lupin x looks and fights like a pat with pat x looks and fights like a lupin
  its not even a vs series at this point  the teams have basically been allies for a while now
  or do something with kairi it was like they were going to develop him into an antihero red in contrast to kenichiro and his brother maybe even have him put umika and touma in harms way to snag a treasure something thats been building up all series would be cool right    wrong here he is looking after a puppy i get the feeling they decided to drop this plotline to try and make him more popular
  gekiranger was the only true vs series
    noel should have been the guy trying to get the teams to work together hence how his costume and fighting style in each form reflects the opposite team putting him in more opposition to the butler but again this show has nothing
is sentai dead i heard the knight themed sentai was either fake or killed off
    the short answer we dont know    the long answer weve had a guy come in here twice now with as of the time unreleased press images state that ryuusouger is not the western fantasy themed series its kanji would imply but a dinosaur and battleship themed affair acting as sentais saving throw before a hiatus akin to what happened to kamen rider and ultraman
  an evil hottie a ryusouger to be evil for an entire arc 12 eps at least a main villain who isnt in a damn rubber suit also on the villain side id like to have different generals with different motifs
  children love dinosaurs
  god i hope sentai gets canceled so we can get metal heroes back
  sentai dying wouldnt revive metal heroes
  toeis got a third henshin hero project theyre working on so metal heroes might stay dead
when do cat scans usually come out this week or next
so sirenstriker and its bundled super form was supposed to be for keiichiro right
  yeah
pick your sentai mecha upgrade
  noel should have been the guy trying to get the teams to work together  he is it was keichero that had to be too bullheaded to hear him out
  im up for anything new and interesting
  people need to stop believing rumors that anons just fart out in these threads wait for the cold hard evidence of toy catalog scans
oh noi dont want to believe it but its real ruseogier is dinosaurs
  didnt chaiyo get in trouble for this
  i shouldnt like golds design but i do
  its yellow you fucking racist
      ok but why they put ultraman in there
    see other thread       
  chinese dont give a fuck
  transforming dinosaur robots my biggest weakness
  ranru retired and the curry guy died a few years back
  noel was told by lupin that bringing the collection together could grant any wish    then why lupindogranio not use the wish when their get all collection 
  maybe even have him put umika and touma in harms way to snag a treasure something thats been building up all series would be cool right  are you a moron we already had an episode where kairi took a gamble and injured himself over shooting toumas body after a ganglar took it hes not going to throw the other two under the bus like that
  the fans do actually probably costed them ultra distribution in china
  because he either did already and we dont know about it or the wish stuff was a lie lupin made up to make noel feel better
  no keiichiro in santaclaus suit  whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
any news on the next series
  dogranio couldnt do it as scissor and blade were missing as well was splash and the lupin magnum was hidden away
  i dont think vs changer and vehicle part of collection since it look differen than collection that gangler use and look like its was made later
  hes already wearing red and white
  they were said to be modified for human use which is why they look different
  no concrete news like toy catalog scans but a leak has been posted about ryusouger having dragons/dinosaurs that turn into battleships and that the team is 3 guys/2 girls take what you see with a huge pinch of salt when it comes to leaks
  he corrected it and its 4 guys 1 girl
  had really strong memorable main characters torin nossan candelira  had really memorable sidecharacters tessai dr ulshade dasharezone bone villain whose powers dont affect girls or shyboys  the villains again manage to be more endearing than the protagonists  i mean i wouldnt mind another kyoryuger the only icky thing about it was red being the lead which is not a problem exclusive to kyoryuger
  dino battleships
  it look like its was made to fight gangler
watching carranger it is way more obvious when a female suit actor is playing a male character than the other way around
  its said in show they were modified for human use how they look is irrelevant
  it would be cool if they brought it back in the form of a team show in the vein of the rescue trilogy shows
  who in particular
can someone post the image for powerups that shows what lupins have and what pats have
and a pic of super pat 1
  source on this
  any of them as obvious as say peebo from bioman
  shirakura said so on twitter
  perhaps the third project is metal heroes rright
  didnt he just say he wanted to do one
  he said he wanted to do one but itll probably only happen if sentai dies
you know i would really enjoy a technological sentai or atleast a vehicle one where none of the vehicles are outlandish in a nonsense sort of way lupin ranger was alright but the arsenal is too chibi/squished besides goodstriker   i d like to see something like lupin kaisers formation but with small cars and a semi trailer for the body and feet x emperor is what killed lupin mecha for me what a shit design    sentai jumped off the deep end mech design wise after go onger which is sad to say because i love go onger but everything was simplified and rediculous shinkenger doubled up on clusterfuck and ugly gosei was just odd hybrid things gokai was anniversary and the one i was most okay with gobus was good but the triple change ruined it and gobuster oh is a mess kyoryuger was crazy simplified but neat designs nin nin was just dogshit besides star boy kyu was interesting at first but went nowhere and the second mech was ugly and it continued from there base lupin was fine same with auxiliary but that dumb fucking frenchman train changer thing is garbage
  i miss shit like the boukenger vehicles and galaxy mega
  i dont think pats originally going to have more toys just because they got extra suit patren ugou from the beginning the point is who sold better thats why vs changer got separated release for lupin red or patren 1 and then lupin get more focus because they sold better     a show about thief vs police is obviously always trying to show the thieves are heroes too and the police must accept it lupin the 3rd persona 5 etc
  like galaxy mega is literally just one mothership that turns into a mech it looks cool super galaxy mega is actually a really good looking upgrade and its just nice and simple you just cant have that in todays toku toy atmosphere
  pats  showa  lupin  heisei  lupin vs patren is the showa vs heisei of super sentai
  dumb fucking frenchman train changer thing is garbage    honestly i think x emperor slash is the best looking mecha in the show too bad about gunner and nearly everything else
  x emperor big dick is better
  thought we didnt have sales on separate teams
  im sorry anon my attraction to faceplates is too strong
  many fans believe the xemperor toy went though some last min retooling to add in the vsx combo to help toy sales this would explain why xs toys got push back from june to july    the xemperor shown here looks a lot better then what we got with the real toy itself there is also no signs or hints of vsx
  theres virtually no chance that x emperor wasnt supposed to combine with good striker in some way that would be basically unheard of lupats toyline is extremely lazy about its combinations or lack thereof but i refuse to believe its that lazy
  there are random grunts with tits in every series that isnt that noticeable looking at the zokuranger was shocking monster portrayed as masculine but even ignoring the hips the body language is all wrong i am seeing lots of monsters with body language that makes them come off as too dainty
  funny that that is the lowest rated episode in sentai history since it is actually one of the most recognizable carranger episodes these days
the pink racer fat jokes make slightly more sense now below the waist shes got some thighs
  just need to be able to open those safe
she fills out pretty well by the standards of tall japanese women tall japanese women always look ridiculously lanky
  i like yellow and pink racer because they have average bodies fits well with the story too
is he pato 0 
  nah its probably satoru
  nah its jim
  i hope so
  or any at all
  how besides the good cools feet how is it worse than toqoh or zyuoh king
  pato n
  not lazy designwise although good cools only alright in that regard lazy in that good cool is the only combination beyond basic armswapping that lupat has all of the other vehicles are completely interchangeable victorystriker and sirenstriker arent extra bodies like good striker that can use the other vehicles for teamunique combinations despite their names there isnt some clusterfuck combination theyre building to or even just a combination using all of one teams vehicles good cool is the only combination that even adjusts the legs in any way everything else is just arms and head hell the lupin magnum is supposed to turn into a giant gun but it doesnt even have a peg on it so you can pretend to have your lupin kaiser wield it    if id been designing the lupat toyline siren would be a gigantic tank the size of goodie but with a thicker more heavyset design that would combine with crane and splash forming the arms and biker facing down to form the center of the chest victory would be a giant jumbo jet that would combine with magic and scissors forming the arms with an adaptor part for scissors that would detach the shield to turn into victorys chestplate and replace it with a closed hand so it could wield blade and cyclone docking into the left leg so it could use the helicopter blades for rider kicks itd have some massive wings bigger than goodies thatd be pointed upward in a vshape in robot mode before this youd have a lot of episodes where the lupins stole some vehicles from the pats during a fight or the pats confiscated vehicles from the lupins and getting the extra strikers would be when both teams finally settled on having all three of their own type if you wanted to go the extra mile have the three strikers then have a combination where sirens legs wrap around goodies to bulk them up and the rest of it turns into a giant shoulder cannon while victory turns into the head arms and wingpack
  but it doesnt even have a peg on it so you can pretend to have your lupin kaiser wield it    have you seen the size of the magnum toy
    these having no response speaks volumes about the show
  have you seen the size of shinkengers silly dragon whipsword thing that still has a peg on it so shinkenoh can pretend to use it even though it looks absurd although on super minipla samuraihaoh it actually kind of works the magnum doesnt even make that token effort to have interaction even though lupinkaiser has actually used it in giant gun form in the show
    i dont keep it saved because it hurts to look at
      and heres as close as youll ever get to seeing super patren 1
  whats he wearing in that
  its more like siren lupin xs wearing 1s dismembered limbs
  relevant twitter account    
what made this mecha so great
  reminds me of the kakuranger ed with the dorodoro that has absolutely massive knockers
you boys getting ready to see the same old merry christmas prop this year
  compared to its predecessors its much less blocky and more willing to use rounded shapes or multiple angles this is most prominent in how the arched top parts and inwardangled sides of the shoulder pads compared to the flattopped shoulders and vertical sides of all of its predecessors give it a more organic and muscular silhouette the increase in detail is most prominent in the legs and feet the colors used are darker and less pastel than many of the earlier robots with live robo being its closest predecessor in this regard the wide horns give its head a very distinctive profile that you could never confuse with any other robots this also shrinks the size of its face relative to the head on most previous sentai robots the face takes up most of the heads frontal view while ones from daizyujin onward instead make the face a smaller percentage to make it look like the head is wearing a helmet this makes the head look smaller on the body because you judge the size of the head by the size of the facial features which in turn makes the body look bigger and stronger
  should have a dino pulling the titanus chariot
  is that really the toy or did someone make that
  its from bandai candys official blog
  what  said on the blog they showed how you could kitbash the siren lupin x toy thats coming out now with the previous patren 1 toy the same way they showed how you could give the splash hydrant gun with the great big patranger shield on it to the pats instead of giving it to the lupins like youre supposed to
    at least someone running that blog has the balls to stand up for the pats
  stand up for  nigga its a tv show theyll be ok
   tfw no mook gf
  hes talking about that leaker who visited a few threads ago
  yeah its been a dream of his to create a tokusatsu series that sticks its the only thing he hasnt really done you can bet if sentai goes even for just one year hell produce the show
  each of siren and victory being able to form robots and allowing the lupins and pats to finally have a mech fight  or fight alongside each other    in fact we havent even had lupin magnum fight patokaiser
  hes lupin black
  hes patren 2ger
    fuck gekiranger did do this whole gimmick better without even being billed as a vs series huh
    well then they couldnt have goodie go lol dont think so if the patrangers were ever in a spot to kill a gangler early or to beat the lupins robot
  based brutally honest poster
  exactly    like even forget the vs stuff having only two full robots and a boy is absurdly bad use of your toyline nearly every sentai for the past decade has managed to pack four full robots into the toyline gobusters has three kyoryuger has five and toqger ninninger zyuohger and kyuranger all have four with 24 extra parts lupat blows nearly all of its toyline on accessory parts that you cant use to make full robots at the absolute minimum sticking two arms on the magnum and using good cool kaiser you still have six useless vehicles left
    god the narrative just gets more toothless the more you think about it
hey /m/ where can i download zyuohger ots links all go to dead magnets and id much rather have a batch download than stream any help the pastebin doesnt have it either
      ot never bothered popping theirs back up after nyaa died but ozc is just ot subs on blurays so dont worry about what subs youll be getting
    oh thank you man i know its not a favorite on this board but it was just pressing all the right buttons for me
  a lot of people here like zyuohger i certainly do at least
  plus these vehicles just are not cool   previous vehicle seasons have the vehicles be cool tactical tools here theyre just things that drive and things that fly and a lot of them dont even transform     kyoryugers arms being dinosaurs biting on were striking and they did had weapons that looked like they are supposed to unlike bike and crane here
  most of the vehicles are fine biker being a yoyo is a neat weapon we dont see often crane and drill are a fine pair that suit the bulkiness of the pats splash being a remold is unfortunate but it would be fine if it gave siren patkaiser symmetry scissors and blade are a greatlooking pair and magics the best of the bunch cyclones the only one thats a total dud designwise victory and siren are duds mostly because they should have been so much more than they are
  crossover with shinkenbrown when
  well the pats are gonna steal siren striker at least
  zyuohgers still one of my most favorite recent seasons i really liked it
  nah noel is going to let them borrow it for that episode only then take it back
  scissors and blade is amazing only wished it gave kaiser a knight helmet cyclone is fugly splash is better because atleast it gives a new chest magic is magic
  they also stopped giving goodie outfits for combinations i liked his little mister rogers esque outfits i like goodie in general but he needed more development couldve even been a bangai hero later on like zuban he didnt even have an evil twin like bad striker or anything so many ideas and designs thrown out for some laziness and cg that blew the budget
  pr never released a shinkenbrown fig  yeesh
  did samurai actually do a shinkenbrown joke it wouldnt really work
  was shinkenbrown was the fisherman that helped blue catch the swordfish mech   then they kinda did
    they kind of did it with bulk and spike
    link  please
  well i guess if you have characters that are the butt of these kinds of jokes anyway in every series
  
  zyuohger is really nice great cast with good chemistry it was pretty comfy
so apparently there are rumors that ryuusouger will have the same colors as kyoryuger will have dinosaur mecha and a ranger key like collectible device
  will have dinosaur mecha    i really dont want dinosaurs for the fourth time
  sasuga dukemon
  you people are all under the impression i make super sentai for you youre all wrong i make super sentai for noone at all apparently  john toei
  i heard they are going to have a white ranger instead of a pink one
  rumors
  i think shurikenjin is pretty cool its probably the best base mecha combination since g3
    isnt siren striker noels toy anyway he probably just lends it to them
  shurikenjin would be nice without the stupid shurikenhat
will mfc ever wake from their coma been a long time since the last dynaman
  they say they aint dead but if it looks and acts like a dead duck then its a dead duck
  i bet the translators are just doing professional projects and dont have time to sub toku quickly right now like how ots releases have been a bit late recently because heatmetal is busy with said projects as well its truly become just their hobby now instead of a main job which is honestly great for them for getting money for their japanese knowledge
  getting dinosaurs again    
with healthy wings
  dope
  wondering the same thing about guis i need more flashman
  there was a leaker here a while ago saying ryuusouger is gonna be battleship and dinosaur themed
      people have also pointed out how for example abarangers bakuryu were just dinosaurs too in spite of the name literally being explosive dragon    the knight theme probably will be there somewhere but in hindsight dinosaurs actually seem much more likely than a dragononly season
  guis is gone forever you can forget about them
  ridiculously detailed and shiny suits at least for sentai standards  helmets are just metal dinosaur heads with glowing eyes  each suit has the potential to go berserk if used for extended periods of time  could be fun
  whatever happened to those br isos
our guy is about to die having accomplished nothing across the series say something nice about him
    damaras lite has nice shoulders
  his hammer is cool
  we already know he survives into next episode mate
  imagine being this wrong
daily reminder this shit happened although we could have gotten a better video quality    
  
    yikes
christmas episode is a mistake prove me wrong they could have fitted more of the storyline if not for abrupt and sometimes awkwardly made christmas episodes
i mightve forgotten what my trip was    best fight weve seen a while  keiichiro sucking it up and finally decides the thieves are needed  that ending scene    this was the best episode in a long time    also  noel is the gangler spy    how the fuck
        anon
  noel is the gangler spy    this is probably 99 preview bait but god do i wish they had the balls to actually do it
  hes wearing all black does that mean something i wonder
  1 christmas episodes are based and comfypilled  2 you have 47 other for your precious storylines  3 shit some series even fit theirs in and make it kino gobusters  4 put down that book the koran and hear some holiday wishes
  secrets
  dont touch me you filthy halfu
  patren 0
    he probably actually is a gangler going by this episode at least
  if hes a gangler why would he bother wasting his collection wish on reviving arsene lupin
  you can say the same for all the main ganglers
if toei is making another kyoruger because it was a success why not make another toqger since it was a bigger success and the train motif was only used once
  toqger  a bigger success  no it wasnt kyoryu sold 3 mil better
    
will we ever get the honneamise sequel
  its not gundam so no
  its nadia
watching dragon ball since i only saw season 1 as a kid man the mechanical design in this series is on point mecha are everywhere humonoid robots jets planes motorcycles and cars every car has a great design and adds character to their drivers     also noticed that bulmas motorcycles look like the akira bike likely thats where otombo got inspiration     toriyama is a fantastic mechanical designer and its totally sad that he and dragon ball is only known for muscular men yelling in fields and talking about their power levels
    toriyama is a great mecha designer and its a shame like you said what has become i wish he was more wel known for it
    that feel when no bulma pilot manga series
i always did think this thing was hella cool
speaking of childhood i also liked team rockets meow bot 3 that dark blue one they funded with all those part time jobs  flashback ep   almost succeeded
toriyama is super underrated as a mechanical designer his designs are whimsical and unique and people dont give him the respect he deserves for them
ribugigo is based
  yeah id love an adventure series headed by him with no shounen kunfu shit like dbz whimsical colorful and so much more
    he could do that or he could go back to staying at home getting his dick sucked by 15 year olds he bought from yakuzas
anybody have a good picture of lunchs motorized unicycle
    kid goku adventure  goku z     dont even mention gt or super
  the original dragon ball fits the bill to a certain extent
  why are you always trying to push dragonball onto this board this is far from the first time you have tried this fuck off post on /a/
  oh come on hes not pushing dragon ball hes just talking about toriyamas mecha design and mecha design/m/
  does he have any manga in production at the moment i remember he was doing jaco a few years ago but i never looked into it
  sandland is mostly that beelzebub does kid goku stuff but the rest of it is comfy tank battles with two old men in mad max land
  looks like a rick dom mixed into dunbine
  that would be crono trigger
  its episodes were genuinely intense i think it even scared me as a kid reminding me of mechanized versions of the aliens from the alien franchise    a shame all sense of wonder and mechanical monsters vanished with og dragon ball later on they are just so human they might as well be humans in z and meme jobberbots in super
  you need to post the art
ive been re watching db lately such a fun show thank you for starting this thread op
  its funny how gt has a bit of that again the baby arc before the characters return to earth has a bunch of references to american sf movies like terminator 2 the machine mutants or alien baby theres even what appears to be a reference to the black hole if im not mistaken
  if nothing else super had the robot universe featuring pepsiman so theres that atleast
  yes thank you
  arent these in dragon quest
  they were toriyama did quite a few robots for dq but i cant remember if he ever did similar ones to the pirate robot    the closest would be the lesser skeleton knights by skull shape alone but not close enough
  iirc toriyama said in one of his little blurbs in the manga that he really loves models of cars and planes so always liked to draw the characters using various machines wonder what a mecha series would be like by him
tv or movie
i love freyja
my dick in right
freyja is kawaii
  movie is more straightforward but loses some character interaction tough i think it can be watched by itself i recommend watching the series first to see if its your thing anyway
  comic
bboth
did people actually like this shit
  yes stop being a killjoy
the music
i liked the ova but the tv show was dumb  the music was good
  whats the difference between the ova and tv series i thought the tv was just an edit
pros  execution music animation    cons  content plot characters
    pretty much this there were some good battles in the first half but the conceit of the secret of the box and the newtype stuff at the very end were not good i liked most of the characters but the overall plot was forgettable and bananas weird crush on mineva was annoying
  the tv series is a pacing nightmare trying stretch the ovas past their breaking point    micott
  meme posting
it is good for almost exclusively the torrington battle a few other battles like that hero of a jegan vs kshatriya the music and the sfx
  this shit couldve been ibo and still kicked ass solely because of the sawano ost
  i didnt enjoy it so those that did must be stupid
  i mean i loved it for the first 3 episode at least its also sawanos magnum opus before going full music equivalent of samefacing
  im not calling anyone stupid for enjoying it im just wondering how anyone could
  unlike any other uc tv show unicorn is actually incredibly well paced it also has exceptional acoustics and i am not even refering to the music here the soundmixing is incredible has very good weight and overall imaging all while they put a lot of effort and time into reusing as few soundeffects as possible the hangar sequence in e1 is so incredibly well done looks spectacular too remove full frontal from the equation and it probably also has the best character designs in the entire franchise probably tied with origin accusing unicorn of having a bad story or shallow characters is an accusation you only really hear from the worst amuro and char drones unicorn really isnt any worse in that regard than former entries my biggest problem was the overly dramatic acting riddhe in particular fuck this daft cunt
  they did
  im just wondering how anyone didnt
i agree with you very much fellow /m/ poster   i respect your very unique opinion
  yes
soul macross tv  soulless macross movie
based
so much soul in this compared to any fight in the movie
very soulful scene
you can see the soul in each of the individual buildings
anno hiding so much soul into one single frame
its okay to murder a old man with senile dementia for revenge   really how can /m/ honestly think gun x sword is good
  revenge is a hell of a drug
isnt it past your bed time michael
  the claw did nothing wrong
  what was his plan again felt like he forgot and everyone just went along with it because going through with it is better than wasting all that time then not going through with it
  damn right it is
  as accidental as it was he killed someone and his bride on the wedding day thats fucked up
  genocidal murderer      he wants everyone to huff him up
  isnt it supposed to be bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding
  their world is a former prison planet and he wanted to use a modified version of the security failsafe device in space to tang the world with himself as the core and primary personality of the new hivemind to achieve world peace or something
  its okay to murder a old man for revenge  its alright
  kills your wife  kills some other dudes wife  implied he killed all of his researcher buddies in space  wants to activate a hyper advanced weapon he and his buddies discovered in space and hit the entire planet with it
  australia
  but they were already in the church claw just came in fucked shit up because elenas technology proved to be a threat to his agenda
  its been forever since ive seen this show i want to rewatch it again but is there a bd release of it out now
reminder
  yeah but the bd was more or less an upscale    
  michael did nothing wrong
  waste of a loli      at least he didnt die a virgin
  he didnt die at all
    fuck em
  that big ass piece of rubble fell on him and the whore no way he lived through that dudes flatter than a pancake
  that drama cd or something doesnt really matter they served their purpose
  it didnt hit them
  seriously that sucks
  if it makes you feel better im pretty sure he was crippled by it
    that only place that its even implied they didnt get squashed is some off show drama cd shit or whatever you can watch the last episode and just assume they died the shitty anti climactic deaths they earned
  old man wants to inflict senile dementia on literally everyone alive  he deserved far worse
  
  never watched this show before but have seen this reaction image posted many times over the years going off of discussion in this thread so far i wonder how this gun x sword dude will get on with domon in srwt
  really  yes
  hes a pretty chill guy more like wont be assed to do something as long as it has nothing to do with his vengeance other characters rally with him thanks to that attitude
  whether or not they had survived is in question since they are never seen afterward
so md geist running around killing innocent people is okay but getting revenge is bad
carmen 99
  domon being the hot blooded and intense guy that he is will probably get pissed at van for halfassing everything other than fighting which will look a bit hypocritical coming from him unless we really are post plot after all
  its good because revenge served best when delivered right onto someones face without any speech  
  that was the best part of the show as a whole for me after the whole journey no bullshit not giving time for villian to have a speech like most shows no flashy finish moves just a simple shoot to kill
  if dementia precludes the reason to kill a genocidal maniac then hitler should be left alive
  im 16 episodes into the show and i still need to see just how bad claw can get though in all honesty even if hes an old man with dementia him killing vans fiance and rays wife is not good at all
  michael did everything wrong   goes out to save his little sister fails and falls in with cultists  drinks the coolaid starts helping the cultists in their plan to mindrape everyone  tells his sister who was the person he was ostensibly doing this for to fuck off  fights the people that want to stop the crazy mindraping madman  has sex with a whore and picks up god knows how many stds  dies to a fucking rock  at no point does he make a good decision
  at no point does he make a good decision  he dies
  to be fair that was more rockkuns decision
he has good intentions and is overall a nice guy but the way he goes about trying to do it where he fucks up
  is this how you ease people into the cult of the claw was right
  no he was wrong he just had good intentions kinda like master asia in g gundam but they both went about it the wrong way
  because the senile old man was about to upload his conscious across the planet and brainwash everyone you dunce
do the drama cds or whatever indicate what van did post show
best girl didnt win  didnt even get her date by the sea  im still so mad
  he killed the only woman van ever loved have you never been truly in love
  space australia
   best part of the show   not helenaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    taking afterthefact retcons in side material seriously  i bet you think kiki was raped by feddies too huh
  i was just pleasantly surprised and was happy to see van just finish the job without usual anime cliches especially since he didnt brood or ponder on it afterwards either its just so rare in this medium
  good van remained faithful to his waifu
  that episode came out of nowhere what a somber end
  written by the same series writer who also wrote the drama cd detailing how michael and fasalina first met  noncanon    most taniguchi shows have canon drama cds planetes was the same
  to me the ending heavily implies that hes going to hook up with wendy
  people ask him a couple of times what hes going to do after he gets his revenge how hes going to fill the void in his life and you see at the very end the friends he made along the way are that if he didnt have wendy or carmen or the others to help him he could have ended up just like ray instead he comes out of the whole experience a better person even if it was just incidental to the whole revenge thing
joshua got the shit kicked out of him the entire series and watched his brother die  but he got to bang yukiko    man did he earn that also can we talk about how the el dora team saved endless illusion from the notdinosaur empire fifty years ago when the claw man was doing fuck all
  thats fine for background information but this attitude of going back on the ultimate fate of characters after the fact to contradict the conclusion they already had is shitty if he really wanted them to live he should have put it in the show a three second shot of them chilling somewhere would have done it
        here you go van i find your balls
  what was vans problem with josh sure the kid was kinda annoying has a brother whos consumed by a raging vengeanceboner but he didnt need to smack and kick him in episode 17 for no reason
  yeah you phrase it better than i ever could especially nice when he has his little reunion afterwards
  he was a shitty hangeron who wasnt bringing anything to the table
    has the gall to call you stupid when he realizes why youre angry at him    fuck him
  pic related      seriously how can such a nice old guy be such a psycho if it werent for the bullshit he did i wouldve had a hard time to believe it      still kind of a dick move
  claw  nice guy  not drinking your coolaid this time mrclaw man
  im serious he looks like a nice guy just to lure you into a false feeling of safety
    in case you havent really noticed van is kind of an asshole
  he has redeeming qualities and isnt a bad person
  implying you wouldnt stick it in fasalina if given the chance
    not if i knew her history no amount of double bagging is making that hoe safe
  but he didnt need to smack and kick him in episode 17 for no reason  joshua saved the claws life and directly led to the deaths of multiple people as a result he tried to stop his brother from becoming a murderer and as a result rey murdered multiple children
gun x swordsan is a treasure
  the little shit kid fucking had it coming shame about his retarded sister
  they did but it still makes joshua a selfcentered hypocrite who never thought out any of his actions
  it better appear in srwt along with naze nani nadesico
  until the little shit started finding himself wanting revenge and was instrumental in stopping the claw after finally finding his balls and probably /ss/ing yukiko afterwards
  talking this much shit about van za naisu gai    go to bed michael
van got literally everything akito did only worse so im interested in what akitos excuse for turning into an edgelors is
  akito was always a chuuni just a different sort of chuuni
when will he make a comeback
before last exile makes a comeback
  is that range murata artwork
i want a wonder 3 anime
    well it does have his signature
  there is a wonder 3 anime
shes cute
  really though theres no way they didnt design her like that on purpose
  holy fuck she is ugly can americans touch something without ruining it
  go to bed weeby
   hot glue when 
  never enough glue for her too big for anyone
  stop this at once
  do not have those thoughts about mothra  especially do not have those thoughts about mothra in a magical girl outfit  double especially do not have those thoughts about mothra in a skimpy maid outfit  i implore you to not have those thoughts about mothra wearing lingerie fluttering her wings at you and coyly waving her antenna
  she looks a bit like a muto
is he really the most powerful character in uc
  no not even close weak newtype on an op suit sure but any other gundam protag would have outdone him if they were in the unicorn
  dont think unicorn can stop gselfs disintegrator mines
probably kamille or uso  banaghers opponents really dont have much of a resume and he even had trouble with them with a ridiculous mech
        phenex piloted by ritas ghost can move at the speed of light with 0gs and control time itself
  the jesus yamato of uc    is this a trick question op
  this phenex casually outdoes bananagers newtype bullshit and id wager that amuro and usso could take him out through superior skills
  can move at the speed of light with 0gs  rip f91  v2
  pilot of a bs ms
  why doesnt she reset to when she was alive
  amuro  skills  lol
  t ramba ral
  achieved the second highest kill count of any pilot in gundams uc timeline as a teenager at 127 confirmed kills canoncially pushes mobile suits so hard that they break if theyre not up to his high standards and brutally curbstomped char into the ground during their final duel is also consistently one of the best pilots in any srw game he appears in    what the fuck is he if not skilled
  cause i reckon the only reason she can manage to move that mad is cause theres no fleshbag in the cockpit controlling it that wouldnt be able to handle that kind of speeds
  i mean why would she keep being a sack plugged to an ms when she can regain her full body by resetting time
  if you had the choice between being a tiny weak fleshbag or a giant blinged out gundam with god powers which would you choose
  stop posting setsuna
  i mean we dont know if theres a living sack of flesh in there even  if all the implications of true nt is real shes probably a literal ghost in the machine
not really   by uc 7 hes definitely a great pilot maybe not an ace pilot material but skilled nonetheless but the unicorn carried him a lot
  i cant even remember any feats he accomplished that werent due to the unicorn having ridiculous newtype powers  he seemed more like a human sized ignition key than the actual pilot
  phenex piloted by ritas ghost can move at the speed of light with 0gs and control time itself  it cant really control time though
  banagher used to be just the newtype component for the ntd but since ep 5 he becomes a good pilot unironically after a pep talk from bright
  the bit with the worker mech in episode 1 was supposed to imply hes decent at least at mobilty
  a sack  are you one of those retards regurgitating the fake spoilers    shes a fucking true newtype essentially a god why would she want to become a human again
  brutally curbstomped char into the ground during their final duel  their duel is pretty even for 90 of the fight the last like 10 seconds is where almost all of the damage is done after char loses an arm and therefore cant stop amuro in hand to hand
    yeah curbstomping char is an overstatement however amuro curbstomped practically everyone who wasnt char once he had the nu gundam
  killing people is an indicator of skill  if banana had wanted to then he could have killed thousands at the end of unicorn because he simply turned off their suits
  he is a millennial special slowflake pilot  unlike previous pilots who had some skills to begin with
  i cant even remember any feats he accomplished that werent due to the unicorn  tell us what feats that kamille and amuro accomplish without their newtype power and dont you dare say  they are good pilots  now everything they do while they sit in a gundam is enhanced by their newtype powers how is a skillset combination of 3handtohand  2newtype any more skilled than 1handtohand  4newtype you dont seem to get what a skill is kamille and amuro are grunt they are like people whove learned a trade and work as plumbers banana on the other hand hes an intellectual a theoretical physicist if you wish his brain is his biggest weapon do you accuse the physicist of being less skilled than the plumber too
waits for the tobia feats to be uploaded
  it literally waves it hands to shoot out psycho waves that turn back time and turns the neo zeongs arms into unassembled parts
  but the tobias feats will never be animated
  it is when those 127 1/2 were actively trying to kill you and moreso doing it in a unit who had become outdated by about the time he killed the black tri stars
  webm of this
    a paycofield probably can stop photon torpedoes since theyre capable of miracles
  why time travel i dont even mean this in a time travel is bad way i mean this in a you could have easily went with something less complicated couldnt they have just went with psycho waves that telekinetically disassemble the arms
  seems like the most hed do is hand wave them to the side but if theyre flooding the field 
  psycho waves that telekinetically disassemble the arms  they do  that
  yeah with time travel thats my problem with it the time travel part is completely pointless and easily replaceable and only exists to make it more complicated
  kamile  designed zeta gundam was already a champion in robotics games top pilot of aeug with many sorties   amuro  electronics hobbyist who piloted gundam after going though manual in desperation had technical knowhow to sort out things while on white base   banagher  piloting gundam unicorn laced with psychomu    i would accuse the physicist of being less skilled than the plumber if both are conscripted and only plumber has the muscle strength to life a gun
  well they need to establish it in order to open the door that allows them to bring back amuro and char  who were actually sent back in time as a result of axis shock  in order to have feddiess vs true shin neo zeon
    or hand wave them out of existence or hand wave them backwards in time so that theyre just components of whatever kind ifields or whatever or just blink them out of existence shit even if all he did was hand wave them aside then all hed have to do is no longer fly in to them which would would he theyre obviously mines or bombs of some kind if all hes done is stop their movement why would he fly in to them afterwards
    considering they only created the door in the first place instead of leaving it up in the air i very much doubt that
  are conscripted and only plumber has the muscle strength to life a gun  this doesnt even make sense if you dont require muscle to lift the gun but can control it with your mind then why would your physical condition matter thats exactly what we have here banana doesnt need to be a properly trained combattant his strongest weapon is his brain it enables him to use the mobile suit in question if anything his skill far exceeds that of the other two since he can kill thousands without any prior combat or engineering training hes gifted beyond comprehension skill isnt something you need to have worked for you can just be born superior
    i think youre mixing up talent and skill skill is trained talent is innate thats literally the definitions
  no but he might become the most shilled character in uc even more than amuro let that sink in
     his strongest weapon is his brain it enables him to use the mobile suit in question    no what allows him to use the mobile suit in question without training is the psycoframe not his brain it utilizes his brain but without psycommu his brain wouldnt be capable of doing so on its own and would have to go through the same on the spot training amuro and kamille did at the very least there is also nothing to indicate that amuro or kamille wouldnt be capable of just as much or more in the same situation since their brains are capable of interacting with psycoframe too     if anything his skill far exceeds that of the other two since he can kill thousands without any prior combat or engineering training    his skill with piloting had nothing to do with that if anything it was determination to dominate the suit and use it for a specific purpose rather than let it use him for its programmed purpose         the only reason you think that is because usually you need to be trained to be skilled at something    no the reason i think that is because thats the actual literal definition of the word unless words no longer mean anything then those are the words to use in that situation they both describe an ability to do something the only difference is in whether that ability is innate or trained if it doesnt need to be trained then its a talent and not a skill     you cant accumulate the required knowledge through sheer talent    what knowledge the knowledge to decide that i dont like those guys coming and want them to no longer be coming the only knowledge you need for that is contextual not accumulated that aside accumulating knowledge isnt skill either its education or observation skill isnt in accruing knowledge its in using it appropriately
 his innate talent simply helps him improve his ability to use his mental powers    the terms arent interchangable because you cant have innate skill the word makes no sense in that context and only talent would fit there not skill because skill isnt innate     he is training everytime he makes use of his talent    if hes training at something then its no longer a talent and its a skill he can be talented at that skill but you cant be skilled at a talent and when you start doing something regularly and trying to improve it then its no longer simply a talent and its something you are working to improve     he doesnt need to go to school to have people teach him the necessary skills to pilot it    he does however need very specific hardware that is tailored to improving him without the need for outside training addendum amuro didnt have to go to school to improve his piloting skill either     at the end he possesses the ability to kill thousands by just waving his hand if thats not skill i dont know what is    technology
  being a space ghost aint really much
at the end he possesses the ability to kill thousands by just waving his hand if thats not skill i dont know what is  imagine being retarded enough to believe this
  what allows him to use the mobile suit in question without training is the psycoframe not his brain  applies so all mobile suit pilots its a moot point you take away kamilla and amuros suits and what are they children who fight like girls    nothing to indicate that amuro or kamille wouldnt be capable   there is nothing that indicates that they would be able to do the same especially nt makes it clear that piloting one of the models to perfection is something that is special rita and banana are the only ones to have done so what youre stating here is nothing but headcanon its not supported by anything    his skill with piloting had nothing to do with that  more headcanon why wasnt he able to do it from the getgo why wasnt riddhe able to utilize his suit to this extent didnt he find the right button    if it doesnt need to be trained then its a talent and not a skill  see above it clearly was trained throughout the show or otherwise he would have been able to simply wave his hand and end the conflict at the end of episode1 he clearly improved his ability to use his brain literally what the entire show was about    the only knowledge you need for that is contextual not accumulated  oh look more headcanon i wasnt aware that you are banana i have a question for you banana did you really just place you butt inside the unicorn and without further ado immediately knew what to do in any given situation did you really not have to improve and accumulate the necessary experience    accumulating knowledge isnt skill either its education or observation  what exactly is supposed to be the difference between receiving an education observing and accumulating knowledge     skill isnt in accruing knowledge its in using it appropriately  thats why i said required knowledge if all you did was acquire it yet never do anything with it then why exactly would it be required
  imagine being retarded enough to believe this  wave hand  all mobile suits in ranged stop to function  yeah ok he doesnt kill them he has to pull out the beamsaber and still slice the floating chunk of metal in halt to he just practically kills them
  kamille goes ss with anything
  even a spoon
  thats not skill retard
  i wasnt aware that the unicon did all of this on its own who was sitting inside of it again utilizing the suits powers ah right not amuro its not skill because uhm anyone can do this uhm i just dont have any evidence that supports this claim but hey who cares
  it doesnt matter if i dont have evidence your claim is so fucking retarded absolutely no one will take it seriously try saying kira is a skilled pilot because he can lock onto 50 targets and disable them all at once without destroying them you will be fucking laughed at and no one will agree with you because thats not skill thats bullshit
     applies so all mobile suit pilots    not really because not all mobile suits have technology that is meant to allow the unit to be used without any training whatsoever like the pscyoframe and ntd system     especially nt makes it clear that piloting one of the models to perfection is something that is special    banagher didnt pilot it to perfection on his first time out     why wasnt he able to do it from the getgo    control the ntd     see above    why whats above has nothing to do with the point     it clearly was trained throughout the show    and is therefor a skill not a talent     otherwise he would have been able to simply wave his hand and end the conflict at the end of episode1    yea not really because the context necessary for that scene wasnt present in episode 1 ie maridas death his own training in the system to control the ntd and so on     did you really just place you butt inside the unicorn and without further ado immediately knew what to do in any given situation    shouldnt you be asking yourself that since youre the one arguing that its talent and not skill     what exactly is supposed to be the difference between receiving an education observing and accumulating knowledge    nothing theyre literally synonymous as you describe them        funnels using psycoframe are described in chars counterattack as something you just give a target and they work out how to attack it on their own theres nothing indicating banagher had to know anything about the suits beyond their existence to stop them because psycoframe does generally just work out the specifics on its own otherwise amuro had to work out the specifics of how to turn back axis and create a giant green trail of light too
  but nobody with a functional brain cares about what some amuro fanboy considers a skill you have no evidence that proves that banana didnt need substantial amounts of skill to do what he did       this spacing   kill yourself
  but nobody with a functional brain cares about what some amuro fanboy considers a skill  you need to learn selfawareness kiddo this board worships amuro now get the fuck out
  this board is full of retarded children who claim that various uc storylines arent canon because they they said so  dont worry i am fully aware of it
  does it hurt to stand alone
     you have no evidence that proves that banana didnt need substantial amounts of skill to do what he did     and you have none that he needed any particular skill to do it either but the burden of proof is on you since youre the one claiming a positive ie that banagher had to have skill to use it while the other side is claiming a negative and you cant prove a negative since therell never be evidence for a lack of something     caring about spacing something thats been present in english for centuries    i bet you were tempted to talk about reddit too werent you
  dont take this kid seriously hes obviously an underage tard
  not really there are many people on this board who consider gundam to be horrendously bad       but the burden of proof is on you  it was already proven riddhe wasnt able to do the same despite having access to a machine just as powerful so what was it didnt he find the button to active that unicorns supermode seems like theres a difference in ability
  when amuro is faced with a crisis he eats shit and dies like a retard  kamille goes braindead from crashing a plane into someone  judua couldnt even beat haman when kamille could  when banagher is faced with a colony laser he mans up and fuses with the psycoframe and becomes a turn controlling god    hes literally the most powerful mc with the strongest will of mind no one even comes close
  not really there are many people on this board who consider gundam to be horrendously bad   well thats too fucking bad for them isnt it theyre unwelcome and so are you
     seems like theres a difference in ability    or determination emotion psychology context etc because the only differences between banagher and riddhe arent in ability and theres nothing anywhere saying the only reason banagher could do that and riddhe couldnt is because of ability especially when maridas ghost visits banagher and talks about using his feelings just before he fuses with the psycoframe
   amuro is faced with a crisis he eats shit and dies like a retard  successfully averts the crisis at the cost of his own life is apparently eating shit and dying like a retard  the enemy retaliating with his own space wizard powers is kamilles fault  judau actually did beat haman  why do you have to lie
  theyre unwelcome  oh no guess ill leave haha oh well maybe not      controlling and shaping your feelings is not a skill  lol let me guess working at the office is not a real job either dont you have some pipes to train
  i think his suit just gets the most out of autism i think  i think any mc would have just as thick of plot armour maybe more in the same suit
  fuck off kiddo
     controlling and shaping your feelings is not a skill    not when a magic ghost gives you the power to turn those feelings in to action and theres no indication youd have been capable of it without her it isnt no
   averts the crisis at the cost of his own life is apparently eating shit and dying like a retard    dies humping his chair the entirety of humanity actually saves itself  kamille couldnt even protect himself from a simple wizard attack while banagher protected himself and beta riddhe from a colony laser  why didnt you use fannels haman you couldve won  judau still has a completely unusable ms at the end and haman has to crash herself into an asteroid to finish the job because judaus a quickshoot cuck who cant satisfy a woman
  receiving help means you didnt do anything yourself  oh wow this is going places guess none of your skills are actual skills since you were educated by others
  controlling and shaping your feelings is not a skill  its so sad that you have to compare a literal newtype virgin to someone whos at least a little experienced to make your braindead point    whoa someone whos had at least a days worth in hours in a suit outperformed someone who was piloting the thing for the first time and also just barely awakening to his jedi powers im so fucking shocked
  its the only point of refernece there is no other person we know of has ever piloted a unicorn model your assumption that others would be able to affortlessly do so is nothing but your personal headcanon i am not saying that riddhe is a good example but he certainly is a better example than  dude he did du nuffin lol  sorry pal banana is to mobile suit pilots what einstein was to a plumber he doesnt need to use his bare knuckles to knock you out he just brainzaps you thats what intellectuals do
    this sure is going places alright imagine a world where telling someone that they can play a sport was synonymous with giving them all the skill and ability needed to play a particular sport
  dies humping his chair the entirety of humanity actually saves itself  he inspired everyone there to save humanity without him to inspire others there would have been no miracle are you fucking stupid  kamille couldnt even protect himself from a simple wizard attack while banagher protected himself and beta riddhe from a colony laser  when was banagher ever attacked by a space wizard has he ever shown himself capable of defending himself from it full frontal showed him his the world but he never directly attacked banagher provide proof that had full frontal dedicated his entire mental strength to crippling banagher he would have survived it  judau still has a completely unusable ms at the end and haman has to crash herself into an asteroid to finish the job because judaus a quickshoot cuck who cant satisfy a woman  after she already admitted defeat and the zz was quickly repaired and judau lived to a ripe old age of 90
  thats not piloting skill retard
    no other person has a piloted a unicorn suit after being given a visit by a ghost who told them about using their emotions for power headcanon isnt needed when its an established fact within the setting that pscyoframes allow untrained use of technology that mostly works things out on its own and that ghosts can give people or technology power
  with giving them all the skill and ability needed to play a particular sport  nice headcanon what part indicates that he received all the power required to do what he did if he was 95 there and got the last 5 from someone else was it not him who did the work right i think we both know the answer       it is when the suit is being piloted by using your brain are you too retarded to differentiate between control schemes holy shit this is painful to read you people really are mentally depraved literally plumbers
  it is when the suit is being piloted by using your brain are you too retarded to differentiate between control schemes holy shit this is painful to read you people really are mentally depraved literally plumbers  so give amuro the same control scheme oh whats that you cant
     if he was 95 there and got the last 5 from someone else    i think we both know you made those percentages up and theres nothing indicating he was even 1 of the way never mind 95 there is however proof that psycoframes translate emotion and intent in to action without knowledge
  so give amuro the same control scheme  i wouldnt mind just so happens that he will never get access to it hence there isnt a shred of evidence that hed be able to utilize it the clown couldnt even survive using the nugundam why would i chain a unicorn model to his genetic code seems like an awful lot of money to waste
  unlike amuro who beats trained and seasoned pilots while piloting for the first time while reading the manual amirite
  he couldnt survive using a much more technologically inferior suit using less of the bullshit technological material that lets bullshit things happen through sheer force of will  whoa its almost like unicorn was made of more bullshit than the nu gundam
  because jean and denim were the best of the best that zeon had to offer at the moment when amuro started first piloting the gundam right and not an overeager rookie and his commanding officer who was too incompetent to keep his subordinates in line
  haha bullshit  nice buzzwords are you typing from the grave amuro deal with it youre a loser who will never reach bananas level no matter how hard you try
  nice argument im just gonna take this one as a w
  do whatever you want its factual that banana did something noone else did while amuro died like the trash he is though its understandeable that a plumber can not comprehend the mental heights that banana was able to reach he prefers to selfidentify as amuro the lowerclass citizen of gundam pilots the guy who dies yet doesnt even understand why things happened such a pity       he was even 1 of the way  and there is nothing that indicates that amuro could have done anything without his newtype power yet we wont even know since he is a newtype and therefore everytime he sits in a suit we have to assume that they are the only reason he gets anything done maybe he wouldnt even be able to go 1 of the way without them who knows certainly not us
  pfffhah youre funny dude i dont know if youre rping to fight against the amuro worship of this board or what but youre pretty funny stick around
  even types like trailerpark trash holy hell
     and there is nothing that indicates that amuro could have done anything without his newtype power    theres 20 odd episodes proving he could     therefore everytime he sits in a suit we have to assume that they are the only reason he gets anything done    except he didnt awaken as a newtype till half way through the show so theres no reason to assume it was affecting him retroactively too
  their duel is pretty even for 90 of the fight  much of amuro so called duel are him concentrating how to stop axis when he knew axis is in freefall he decided to trash char under 2 minute top
  its even because amuro is fighting defensively against char it isnt even his goal to kill him he focuses on stopping axis until hes done everything he could which is when he decides to fight char and destroys him in under 3 minutes
  theres 20 odd episodes proving he could  did he stop being a newtype during that time you seem to mix up his classification as a newtype and his awareness of being one activation is no more than a visualization of the effects you think people who have genetically evolved to such an extent suddenly happen to be something they werent before    additionally those 20 episodes are irrelevant anyway its the equivalent to you saying that youre more skilled at writing because youre better at using chalk when no one uses chalk but everybody uses a pen banana also fought various opponents without making actual use of the ntd hence he was just more or less piloting a normal suit if the grunt amuro fought at the start of 0079 is him showing his skill then banana fighting without ntd is the exact same once the awakening happens which is irrelevant but lets play your game it might very well become 0 effort on amuros part and the newtype power do everything for him after all thats what you claim is the case for banana despite the ntd having a time limit now if we are to assume that amuro did more than 0 while bieng in control of his newtype bullshit then banana was as well sorry pal thats how it works you cant have it both ways
did you not watch gundam nt where he is forced to fight against the neo zeong ii in a silver bullet and all he can do is take potshots at it that ultimately do nothing to say that the unicorn carried him is an understatement       want another example riddhe was absolute garbage the whole ova only able to competently fight off oyw suits but when he got the norn he was fighting off swarms of enemies without looking at their general direction
  oh my god are you retarded
  there is literally a conversation between char and amuro about how neither of them would have awakened their powers as a newtype unless they had taken to the battlefield this is chars defense for bringing someone like lalah into a warzone to awaken their abilities as a newtype there are many references within the show as to how someone can awaken to their newtype powers and to nurture and strengthen those powers
whats even going on in this thread are back and forths a like this supposed to be fun for at least two people i find that hard to believe
  what part of your own post dont you understand awakening a dormant power is not the same as creating it out of thing air you are a newtype whether you are aware of it or not the activation of the respective abilities just makes you aware of that very fact
  if its dormant its not being used you idiot
     did he stop being a newtype during that time    he didnt even start so how could he stop     activation is no more than a visualization of the effects    according to     you think people who have genetically evolved to such an extent suddenly happen to be something they werent before    when that something involves using a sense they werent capable of prior to activation then yea i do amuro never showed an ability to connect with others mentally emotionally or psionically before lalah and never even showed the ability to anticipate attacks without awareness of their existence prior to the black tristars its like someone realizing they have sight after going through life with their eyes bound not working due to sickness or genetics or just plain useless due to their environment it isnt likely but it is possible     banana also fought various opponents without making actual use of the ntd    not without using the psycoframe though since the psycoframe is omnipresent and its purpose is to translate thoughts and desires in to action including helping to speed up reaction times and make piloting smoother and easier technology amuro did not have access to     after all thats what you claim is the case for banana despite the ntd having a time limit    not really i mentioned the psycoframe a lot more than the ntd for a reason
  newtype isnt a power its a genetic classification the list of newtypes very much indicates that they are superior at birth hence why they are all have such central rolls in the narrative      this spacing again  lol
  newtype isnt a power its a genetic classification  citation needed
    the list of newtypes also includes katz hathaway and others who arent much use as pilots indicating being a newtype doesnt translate to automatically a skilled pilot     whinging about spacing again    lol
    then you dont have a very good imagination
      could be wrong since it isnt cited properly but it pretty fucking obvious given what newtypes are they are evolved individuals
  this tells me nothing you stupid faggot quote and cite your argument
  it literally says  genetic type  are you really too retarded to ctrlf and search for newtype
  wheres the citation
  pretty sure a citation requires a quote pulled from a work to be cited properly
way to out yourself as a shitty wiki surfer whos seen maybe one work of a series and thinks hes a master of everything nerd too bad that had to be unicorn literal garbage
  it does but give the fact taht i dont have access to hundreds of gundam databook and the fact that these people seem to be incredibly autistic about managing this wiki i see no reason to assume that its a lie i mean at the end of the day newtype being a genetic classification is just logical anyway they are evolved individuals how does that happen through genetic altnerations who do you awake dormant abilities to break through something get full/better control over you genetically granted abilities
  i dont actually know if this is true but im still going to pretend this is true
  i didnt even need to read the website to reach that conclusion i simply opened it for conformation since you wanted a source its pretty self evident that it is genetic its the whole point of the fucking franchise the only way you evolve is through genetic change and newtype have always been evolved normalfags       nah i am pretty sure it is like 100 thats how genetics work and what evolution means you dont evolve by buying a new car
    and yet despite their autism the wiki is filled with outright falsehoods including until recently stuff about how the turn a and turn x needed the moonlight butterfly program nanites and power to use the system but neither had all 3 in the anime until they met and that the turn a tanked a nuke for instance just because theyre obsessed with detail doesnt mean theyre right about it
    you also dont evolve an entirely new sense 3 or 4 generations after exposure to a new environment strict adherence to realism over dramatics isnt top of gundams priorities
    im stupid and i dont actually have anything to back me up      derp im stupid and i dont actually have anything to back me up
  then youre welcome to dismiss the wiki and explain what an evolved individual is newtype of not genetically superior which is the the point of the shows and most of the wars      why do you double post
  maybe the term evolved individuals has to do with their ability of understanding empathy and instant connection with others considering their whole conception was created during the 70s the word evolve does not necessarily mean biological    the only genetic thing i can think of with newtypes is seed and im pretty sure they arent even called newtypes
  seed still considers that phenomenonhigh spatial awareness closely linked to evolution
  ability of understanding empathy and instant connection with others considering  how is telepathy not a biological evolution what am i missing here
  what were seeing here is 100 the inability to consider that telepathy exists in scifi
why dont you prove that amuro was using his newtype abilities before he there were any visual indicators that he was
     explain what an evolved individual is newtype of not genetically superior    i dont have to explain what they are in terms of genetics when i can explain it in terms of physiology amuro wasnt aware of and didnt use those sense until 20 odd episodes in to gundam regardless of whether they there always there or not theres nothing saying he was always using them prior to his first awareness of them so theres no reason to suppose it     why do you double post    because the other post didnt show up until after i had posted the first time and i wanted to respond to it        the 70s when it was considered a mental or emotional evolution rather than a biological one thats where the bullshit about humans only utilize x of their brain came from the idea that if we just evolved our thinking we could utilize the rest and become super human in some manner never mind that its not true and that removing any part of the brain physically fucks a person up and weve known that for decades prior to that line of thinking
  the entire point point of newtypes that is being driven home over and over again is that they are a group of people that adjusted to the new living conditions in space adjusting like this led to innate abilities on their end they were dormant but still existeted and had to be activated the show/franchise drives this point home all the fucking time these people who had to get used to a new environment are now different its basically slapping the statement that they have biologically evolved in your face and its been doing so for 40 years
  nice fanfiction there famalam    one thing is the capacity to manipulate time and another is the confirmation of the afterlife as another plane of existence
  except we dont see any biological change what we see here is that they just adjusted to manipulating minovsky particles    basically gundam has become star wars in terms of how it treats the jedi/newtype legend
     become    that implies a process or change happened if anything it went the opposite way and started as a mental or spiritual evolution but has tried to make it more of a physical and biological one over time
  wait i am not really into star wars doesnt an increased chlorowhatever count imply genetic superiority otherwise why would some people have more than others and therefore be in a position to use the force
  in what way we clearly have nt ghosts and the same beyond the time aspect as force ghost have in tlj
    in that 0079 implied it was a spiritual thing with everyone on the white base becoming newtypes by the end because of their experience of war and char referring to how war awakens people to the power of newtypes but even by chars counterattack the narrative was about humans as a whole were evolving in response to their new environment beyond the time and force ghosts were part of 0079 too not as large a part as later works have made them but there regardless amuro tells lalahs ghost that he believes everyone will eventually be capable of seeing time like they can
  uh werent there like other units nearby too they didnt blow up  turn a was removing the radiation or something
    the first time the turn a is in the presence of a nuke its actively fleeing the explosion and never gets hit by it  only the shockwave which sends it and sochies kapool tumbling if the turn a can be said to tank a nuke because of that they so can a kapool and the gallop which isnt far from them but is hit by the shockwave and unruffled its not even indicated it removed any radiation during this scene just that it detected some    the second time its in the presence of one is when it throws two nukes at the mistletoe asteroid which it approaches but never directly interacts with the explosion of it only goes up to the edge of the explosion here it does use a shield that seems to be doing something to the radiation though as does the nearby turn x head neither gym or harry whose sumo is holding the turn x head know what the energy shielding is though suggesting its moonlight butterfly derived when considered alongside the colorful nature of the shielding
  you forget the fact that he was adoctrinated as a child by his father
              this is your brain on wiki summaries
name a stronger move then a psychodrama hand wave
  troll harder nigger
  yamato beam spam
  cant shoot a beam if youre disassembled
  he says having virtually no evidence for the contrary  your assumption that banana didnt do anything nothing but headcanon my friend      maybe rewatch e7 of unicorn he doesnt need to touch them he just throws the magic wave a few miles
  cant be disassembled if no one can touch your plot armor
  heh
  im not reading the entirety of your passiveaggressive rant but are you arguing that due to banana having access to magic unicorn powers that makes him a good pilot or something youre calling a sage a warrior
  literally impossible
  amuro pushed back an asteroid in a suit not covered in magic plates to the teeth and even before the newtype mumbo jumbo the guy displayed impressive combat skills against regular opponents what makes you think hed be weaker than banana if given a unicorn of his own bananas skillset amounts to  transforms  tanks beam  waves hand
  at least until another ova comes along with a new main character gundam escalation is dumb as fuck
    your assumption he did anything is the headcanon chars counterattack established that psycoframe funnels work simply by giving the funnels a target and letting the funnels work out the details themselves theres nothing indicating the handwave was any different ie that banana gave the system a wish stop those suits and the psycoframe worked out the specifics
  its like video game consoles
  because controlling time is a figure of speech for going past the three dimensional
  not that guy but  the way i look at it is  piloting skills is all about how well you translate your thoughts into the controls  not everyone can get into a mech and do organic movements like punching and kicking like amuro  but with ntd systems anyone can do those moves  so amuro with a unicorn of his own wouldnt exactly be better hed just be doing what he was doing already
  if given a unicorn of his own  wont ever happen so whats the point as far as were aware the only two people who have managed to properly utilize the unicorn models are banana and rita theres nothing that implies that amuro could do it thats just what you want to believe      and letting the funnels work out the details themselves  it doesnt no idea what movie you watched the subs are trash the visualization of the situation clearly shows that quess thinks of something and that the funnel actually replicate it to a t see the webm why exactly would this visualization match the actual attacks of the funnel if the funnel would just randomly attack anyway
  yknow except the demonstrable use of localized timetravel both in unicorn and the preview for narrative
  i dont know the guy still managed to resonate with people and pushed back axis with the nonbs armed nu      wont ever happen so whats the point  youre arguing tech powercreep not piloting skills
  the neo zeong time travel bit was established as a vision so far there hasnt been any explicit demonstration of _actual_ time travel
  not piloting skills  nah thats your headcanon there is nothing that even implies that anyone but banana and rita has the skill to utilize the unicorn models to perfection in fact its been made very clear that those two are special beyond comprehension you just delude yourself into believing that anyone can do it when there have been various people who failed to fully utilize the banshee calling it tech powercreep is just dull at this point
  the phenex rotted the arms off of the narrative and the dialogue in narrative says that the generators were reset to a point preproduction on the units the unicorn encountered    how explicit does this have to be stated
  why did the neo zeong fall to dust after said vision
  no fucking shit banana and rita are the only ones with access to the unicorns in the whole series this is some top fucking bait holy shit
  only ones with access to the unicorns in the whole series  good to know and here i thought that they were three brother with the banshee being one of them do you know what the banshee is the black version that was piloted by two different people     top fucking bait  clearly must be since you cant possibly have watched unicorn
    is he really the most powerful character in uc    lol
     it doesnt no idea what movie you watched    chars counterattack     the subs are trash    the official dub says the same thing ill take their word over random anon who just so happens to be arguing a thing the subs dont support      the visualization of the situation clearly shows that quess thinks of something and that the funnel actually replicate it to a t    why dont we watch the entire scene oh look nanai says that quess has to visualize the target and give the order but that the funnels advance on their own which is just what we see her do visualize them attacking after selecting a target no details on how to get there etc nothing suggests she controls their every moment and the dialogue flat out states that all she needs to do is give them orders and theyll do it on their own
  who were the various people that failed to fully utilize it riddhe activated the psycoframe to stop a colony laser and he didnt even pilot it that long and marida understood only losers pilot ntd suits
  and here i thought that they were three brother with the banshee being one of them  you didnt mention the banshee in your original argument point stands that youre arguing tech powercreep not piloting skill the uncorn units arent even mentioned by the time of cca and subsequent sidestories    clearly must be since you cant possibly have watched unicorn  youre so triggered people called you out on being a wiki shitter haha dude
  how do you see  disassembled to a time before they were constructed  and get  reset to a time before they were constructed  out of it
  advance on their own  do you understand what advance means you still send the command and visualize the attack just because something isnt real time doesnt mean that you arent the one controlling it using that logic you wouldnt even be controlling your own arm since theres a delay between you thinking of moving and the arm actually moving       so you have two people who never got past activating the frame i get the feeling that banana did i bit omre than them might wanna rewatch the show      you didnt mention the banshee in your original argument  please get a trip so i can filter you you literally say that the only people who had access to the unicorn models are rita and bananan youre literally too retarded to know what a unicorn model is stop wasting traffic
  so you have two people who never got past activating the frame  did did you watch the show yourself    please get a trip so i can filter you  this isnt reddit
is riddhe a newtype how good is he as compared to the other newtype pilots in uc
  did did you watch the show yourself  ok granted riddhe does a bit more doesnt change that banana needed like 60 seconds to activate the psychoframe for the first time and that his ability to pilot using the ntd mode vastly outshines that of any other individual bar rita       the ntd wouldnt even activate if he wasnt one
musashi is such a shitty warrior the guy never got to use machine guns  the wiki shitters logic in a nutshell
     you still send the command and visualize the attack    thats not what advance means in isolation or context all advance means is to move forward never mind that nanai specifies they automatically advance to the mark automatic meaning on their own or without conscious thought     using that logic you wouldnt even be controlling your own arm since theres a delay between you thinking of moving and the arm actually moving    thats not even remotely the same thing that theres a delay in response isnt the same as operating without thought or on its own never mind that controlling your limbs takes years of training which is what being a toddler and learning to walk effectively is after a while it becomes second nature but even controlling your own limbs takes that training funnels dont meaning they operate on their own
  does that mean everybody in g gundam is on average a better pilot on control scheme alone
  weak newtype on an op suit sure  literally where are you getting this from
  automatic meaning on their own or without conscious thought  kinda dull isnt it you need to give a conscious command and yet you still claim that they move unconsciously nothing you say actually makes any sense youre just too retarded to differentiate between an assist system which we have here and something that is fully automatic the assist system still requires active input and therefore active involvement of the pilot hence control    never mind that controlling your limbs takes years of training  not because its hard but because your limbs are limiting you     meaning they operate on their own  honestly i am fine with this since it would cement the fact that timino is an incompetent director after all why visualize an attack to t in a persons thought just for said thoughts to have no effect youre also confusing assist with an automated process again she still actively imagines the attack nothing happens on its own
  to make gself vs phenex canon
  full frontal shit on the efs flagship and was said to destroy an entire mobile suit core and three warships
  there were many implications of him being a cyber newtype but apparently fukui said he isnt one
  try saying kira is a skilled pilot because he can lock onto 50 targets and disable them all at once without destroying them  ive never seen seed but that makes sense to me
  there have been various people who failed to fully utilize the banshee  marida and
     you need to give a conscious command and yet you still claim that they move unconsciously    you appear to be mixing up the command and the routine the funnels need an active command to move but to work out how on their own the command is to move not how to move     not because its hard but because your limbs are limiting you     those two things are not even remotely mutually exclusive whether something is limited or not has no bearing on whether or not its hard to control if it was easy to learn to control them at least some toddlers would work it out super quick every toddler works it out at almost the exact same pace though its so predictable you can find calendars detailing what you can expect a baby and toddler to learn to within about a week all over the internet     why visualize an attack to t in a persons thought    she doesnt at all her image of them attacking doesnt include her own suit the target or even the actual physical space theyll need to move through just the funnels firing thats not to a t she gives them a vague image commanding them to fire and then they do
  you didnt mention the banshee in your original argument  he did tho
  point me to the scene that shows blondy fully utilize the banshee and no what he did at the end of unicorn isnt full utilization of the model you should realize that since seconds afterwards banana suddenly shot autism waves      not how to move  honestly i am done with you here you literally claim   giving the funnels a target and letting the funnels work out the details themselves  when your own fucking webm proves that this isnt true its a target  an attack and as i said the visaulization of the attack matches it to a t so believe what it is you want either tomino is incompetent or the visuals match the events at this point i am fine with either
falling for bait this hard  embarrassing
  point me to the scene that shows blondy fully utilize the banshee  and no that one scene where blondy fully utilizes the banshee doesnt count
  fully utilizes  its been made pretty clear that the unicorn models are capable of more than he did two of them can turn back time by waving their hands why wouldnt the banshee be able to do so
  one /a/utismo vs the entirety of a slow board  its a fun spectacle isnt it
  i know reading comprehension
     your own fucking webm proves that this isnt true    the webm shows and says nothing of the kind and flat out has a character say the funnels advance automatically     the visaulization of the attack matches it to a t    it isnt even close the only thing she visualizes is the funnels firing there isnt even any other objects in her visual never mind to a t
  its been made pretty clear that the unicorn models are capable of more  now using reasoning tie this with your original argument that amuro is a lackluster pilot compared to banana the hand waver before you derailed the whole argument with semantics like the tourist shitposter you are
     a machine capable of many things    speaking of so was banagher riddhe on the other hand wasnt because while his machine was a unicorn variant it wasnt empowered by a newtype ghost a newtype ghost is one of the other things the unicorn and the phenex have in common
  explain the practical difference setting aside normal shitty gook sunrise offenglish
  its an entertaining read to be sure
  youre typing posts using a computer a machine capable of many things yet i dont see you investing a super ai because you lack the ability to do so  what makes you think im not a phone shitter
  i gave you the benefit of the doubt dont disappoint me now
  more than enough people gave you the benefit of the doubt itt you disappointed everybody
  cant see how    ascending to godhood   vs   dies to a rock    seems pretty clear whos the superior mobile suit operator cant blame me for people being too dumb to understand that newtypes are genetic freaks hell theres an entire film about it looks like people dont actually listen to my boi casval
  banana  most powerful  nopehe is obviously not a man of destiny
  theyre not this im going to bisect your post and counter it line by line bullshit has been happening a lot lately and im starting to think its the same small group of retards doing it  its especially sad when the participants cant even agree on the dictionary definitions of words so the whole argument may as well be two people yelling at different walls
     i dont think x is fun therefore noone else couldnt    hmmm
  mfw i read it as skilled  dodged a bullet there anon
itt there are some faggot who actually believe amuro ray is incapable to piloting unicorn     even with a cockpit fused with psychoframe he himself become the beacon of human will to drove axis out as for piloting skill you faggot just baiting theres a reason why even char himself can barely keep up with him even his bio brain from oyw is proven to be an impossible challenge for tobia team and old judau the only way they manage to defeat it is by destroying the whole base with the amuro bio brain still inside
unicorn fans are the worst thing that hapened to /m/
  its even because amuro is fighting defensively against char it isnt even his goal to kill him he focuses on stopping axis until hes done everything he could which is when he decides to fight char and destroys him in under 3 minutes  so the same excuse kira gives when shinn stomps his ass
  being immortal   having reality bending magic psychic powers  can power a fancy mecha with just your magical soul energy  can explore the universe for all eternity   better than a fleshy human weighed down by gravity
  well if kira is called skillless when hes the only person who can deflect beam shots with a beam saber and fire from different unusual angles using himat well youre not really going to win if the people are by default biased against said character    its like the endless lebron vs mj debate people who are clearly biased against lebron wouldnt want to admit that in terms of skillset and conditioning lebron has the edge
  he doesnt seem like an exceptional pilot or even like a particularly powerful newtype outside of the influence of the psycoframe as opposed to judau who could block bullets and make giant projections nonnewtypes could see and the queen from victory who could actually heal people unaided
    personally i think kira wouldve won if he had gone for lethal shots from the outset or at least caught onto what tricks shinn was pulling much quicker by the time kira actually did shinn had too much momentum poststrike kira has a massive weakness largely due to the writing of being fucking poor at adapting to unusual tactics even his victory against rau was partly due to rau just giving up as rau thought he had already won because mad daddy zala was about to fire genesis
    i thought the same thing
  poststrike kira has a massive weakness largely due to the writing of being fucking poor at adapting to unusual tactics  which is ironic given that it was his calling card but honestly we will never know what kiras true skillceiling is its just because the way he is written and how the series was animated that gets him crap outside the series the freedom/strike freedoms especially the exvs freedom moveset is one of the flashiest most satisfying ones to master
  i believe the actual explanation is that once full frontal lost the will to fight the psycoshard was influenced by his psyche and made the machine brittle
  exvs freedom  full boost charge  press r3 to be possessed by flay
  outside the series the freedom/strike freedoms especially the exvs freedom moveset is one of the flashiest most satisfying ones to master  outside of the series we have shit like the psycho haro and phoenix variants to worry about so why even let that kind of competition in
  are they controllable in the other games as in you can move the suit as far as the psycho haro and phoenixes are concerned theyre basically rpg characters     its the same as people pitting cloud vs zidane with rpg logic cloud would rape zidane because he has a 15hit with omnislash combo while zidane only can hit you with grand lethal once but plotwise its implied the zidane is more powerful
  now given dissidia people can now see how they fare without the rpg mechanics
  theyre basically rpg characters  so  some of the most op video game characters of all time are rpg characters
  you are comparing the characters from different appearances to each others rule sets g generation has strike freedom and originals all in the same game for comparisons sake
  except ggen is primarily statbased and primarily my point was that kiras moveset outside of the series limited animation looks to be highlevel and very flashy compared to most other pilots but again people are in a hurry to dismiss it because of character bias
  theres not much to dismiss youre just saying its flashy
  like the basketball analogy its high degree of difficulty an inseries example is beam deflection the timing and coordinationno pun intended needed to deflect those beams yet people scoff him off as soon as one of the least skilled
  stats in g gen encompass everything though even pilot skill and ability
  even in gundam there are statfags
  i think thats largely due to inconsistency in how kiras skills are portrayed he sometimes does cool shit like take on multiple gundams with near equal specs to his by himself or reprogram his os on the fly or deflect beams in a au where that shouldnt be possible but then theres stupid shit that either breaks the suspension of disbelief firing multiple guns at the same time at multiple moving targets and only taking out their guns and cameras or makes him look like an absolute fucking jobber the loss against shinn constantly shooting beams at enemies that can clearly deflect them etc
   hes the only person who can deflect beam shots with a beam saber   loran uso seabook setsuna
  by striking said beam most of the other guys are either spinning the beam saber or cutting the beams in halfgn sword gonna gn sword
amuro ray seems like the best bet but its hard to say if its really intended or out of some weird deference people have for the og pilot
  himat  kira stands still on the battlefield shooting at everything and nobody shoots back at him  his shots hit several target each and always disable only   by the time we get to strike freedom and its bits the bits are shown as staying still behind sf yet the shots on the enemies come from different angles   show takes the time to show its freedom targeting system that does the heavy lifting anyway
  not to mention that sometimes there are more beams shown than freedom has the guns to fire them from
   / full burst  this is the common mistake people think with himat himat is what enables freedom to be very very agile and maneuverable
    no im pretty sure all of those characters strike said beam too
  amuro and char reconciling their ideological differences and resolving their own personal conflicts in a lightspeed moment sacrificing their bodies to create a miracle   is somehow amuro eating shit     the narrative power creep of unicorn stomps on one of the best moments in mecha history
  it doesnt matter how powerful banagher is when the series hes from is flat out terrible
  reconciling their ideological differences and resolving their own personal conflicts   i dont think they do that though
     amuro and char reconciled their differences   in a lightspeed moment whatever that is    what movie did you watch
did i miss some kind of retcon with all the narrative stuff coming out last i heard banagher stopping the colony laser shutting down all those suits was said by the creator to be a one time miracle that almost killed him and he could never do again if thats still true then that bit shouldnt be considered when judging his worth as a pilot
    powerful is a weird word because power is largely based on equipment    most dangerous is probably either amuro or uso though these are the two pilots who consistently pushed the envelope using the resources handed to them
  not only are you wrong youre also missing the point of the thread this is about what you like most but which individual is more powerful amuro dies hence he eats shit banagher on the other hand rewrites history and does so without any damage
  amuro dies  actually official sources list him and char as mia
     rewrites    no he just writes banaghers doesnt change the events that did happen previously just dictates the events that happened around him which amuro dud too which everyone does just by existing really
this whole thread  did i stumble on narutoforums by accident
    actual official animation shows amuro char and lalah as ghosts
  rewrites  f91 is still canon buddy
    he turned back time hence he rewrote history even if it was just the history of the involved suits    t gundam nt
  the first 27 mins or so are up and explain the time travel stuff that already happened in unicorn
    none of his actions changed how a previously established history did go only how a possible circumstance would go so he didnt rewrite anything
  no cause late uc pilots are even more powerful with their op machines    yes even the guy in gsavior
  amuro char and lalah are inside the t unicorn confirms that like rita they have become true newtypes
  the attack is called himat full burst when games and such bother to name it hence himat for short
  himat is the whole scope of the freedoms capabilities     thats why its called dragoon full burst once the strike freedom does it
  far from the best newtype and even many oldtypes like kou would make him eat shit    literally carried by his overpowered as fuck gundam that powercreeps so badly that even in the v gundam era would shit on cutting edge technology ms with its literal reality warping powers
  so what happened to him and the other guy at the end
  you again what a sad life
    old man flit can block/parry individual shots without spinning like a jedi
    whats the difference between striking to parry the beam and striking to cut it beyond the physics of the setting
  episode ill make a webm
  they are antimatter that turns anything they touch into energy to be absorbed back into the gself perfect    if the unicorn turn back time on the photon torpedo what does the photon torpedo become what comes before energy and particle
    they are contained antimatter if they werent contained in some form then theyd implode immediately upon existence the container is an ifield which can presumably be turned off or set back to before it was turned on if we have to go that route
  the phenex with an upgraded power source in destroy mode couldnt even beat gself with no backpack photon hax seem just as unpredictable as newtype feats at times   i remember there was a time early in the show before he got special backpacks and just sort of launched an energy projection of the gself as a projectile
    the phened didnt use psycoframe hax which are way more powerful in effect than photon hax the kind of thing youre talking about messed with masks controls and instruments for a few seconds phenexs can disable entire squads indefinitely
  so how do all the pilots even rank vs each other with their own pro and cons uc only or au included regardless surprised i dont see a list how do seabook and tobias fit into all of this and how do they compare to uso who is even stronger between kamille vs jewdo considering one was more skilled during his show and had better control over nt power while the other had much more potent autistic nt power but less control over it and also has been in service all the way to old age in a slapped together junk of a suit using zz gundam as base    i mean its just theorizing but really curious
  i mean pilots themselves given respectively equal suits not based on what they pilot in their show   also how would gundam pilots compare to macross pilots
  he barely blocks them in that one episode but kio does it in 38/39 i think  flit 35 in the episode kio gets captured
how do we inform tomino so he can oneup fukui again for strongest gundam title in greco movie
  its really just photons that split into negative/positive components no      episode 25  13m20s to 15m20s 
  combine the 3 super funnels from the glucifer unit to the perfect pack the gself is the one with the full body photon batteries while the other two units only have it in the head  maybe combine the yggdrasils abilities too
  aint it does nothing even if the unicorn manage to turn off the torpedos containter    the torpedo explodes upon contact and instantly break all thing down to energy
  photons dont have negative and positive components
    why would he want to it was the mechanical designer insisting the gself was the strongest nothing in show suggested it was the strongest and could beat the unicorns psycoframe hax and even the phenex short wasnt directed by tomino hes not bothered about getting in to a strongest unit pissing match        i wont be home for another 20 or so hours to check that time stamp but nothing in greco is on the same level of bullshit as the unicorn and phenexs psycoframe miracles is it the tractor beam thing        if you turn off the ifield container theyll explode immediately as in before theyre even close to a target not when they hit the target done early enough its possible theyd fuck up the gself in the explosion rather than the intended target
  we never got to see it at maximum output so the speed may vary maybe the unicorn cant wave them quick enough
  he doesnt have to he literally already had gself bet phenex in a special short
  is it the tractor beam thing  yep
  the pilot seems to exhibit problems too in episode 26 when tractor beam is used cant the gself disable the unicorn first
  if you turn off the ifield container theyll explode immediately as in before theyre even close to a target not when they hit the target done early enough its possible theyd fuck up the gself in the explosion rather than the intended target    assuming there are container the thing that form the torpedo either super dense antimatter or proton particle we have only see it was in use in the vacuum of space and when it made contact with the wuxia it immediately dispersed into light with a good chunk of the mech
  the wave essentially moves at lightspeed or instanteously since its a form of energy shouldnt the power level on the photon torpedoes be for the destructive yield instead of the projectile speed why would projectile speed even matter or change for an object that is supposed to vaporize materials on contact if it had the option to go faster surely it would already go at the maximum attainable speed so it would be as effective as possible and not require leading the target
    we also have no idea what setting they were at or if they could be done any faster supposing they could be faster is practically inventing fanon to make them better even if they were used at 00000000000001 so that full power would take out a star lf it still wouldnt make them more powerful than i can do whatever the plot demands which is what psycoframe hax are    the gself is by far the better suit in the vast majority of circumstances it is faster stronger has better weapons etc its just that veeu occasionally the unicorn has circumstances line up that mean it is temporarily a better unit unless theres a psycoframe or miracle pack that isnt going to change        what makes you think the units momentum bring arrested and engines stopped is going to stop its physics breaking emotional interface from breaking physics due to emotions out of interest
  it has to be contained somehow otherwise it would just disperse
     assuming there are container    if its antimatter there literally has to be to explain why it exists for more than a split of a second and doesnt just immediately explode in the gselfs face
  what makes you think the units momentum bring arrested and engines stopped is going to stop its physics breaking emotional interface from breaking physics due to emotions out of interest  if only he just shot the cockpit before the pilot got emotional enough that would solve everything thats how the shamblo and its psycoframe got defeated
    you could literally say the same of the rx782 the beam tractor isnt more powerful than the psycoframe in that case its just the pilot utilizing his tools better
  then whats the point of a machine being supposedly superior if it never really displays it all that often and doesnt get used properly    its like all of those super ms that zeon makes blueprints for or even builds a few of but they never get to do anything because they didnt do a whole lot supposedly the best ms of the oyw sure actually superior not since it didnt do a damn thing and might have had defects and didnt actually get a chance to participate
     then whats the point of a machine being supposedly superior if it never really displays it all that often and doesnt get used properly    what machine are you even asking about because the unicorn line has displayed their power on multiple occasions now its not superior to something like the gself all the time either only occasionally when circumstances align so that the psycoframe is supercharged to essentially which is basically how the plot paints it
  but how would the unicorn time manipulating interact with the torpedo then    if the torpedo is is really antimatter then it container could not be the ifield that we commonly know does it have to be some form of pure energy no
  oh thats okay it never matters because regardless of what material its made of it wouldnt be immune to erasure by time travel
     if the torpedo is is really antimatter then it container could not be the ifield that we commonly know    why do you know the limits or specifics of ifield physics
      arent these already elementary particles       with e/e you get two photons and they dont necessarily have to destroy itself  may also interact with each other without annihilating
    interaction without annihilation always takes external intervention to my knowledge
  that is not uso
  that phenex is not comparable to the original it clearly malfunctioned at the end for mask anyway
  she wasnt in the cockpit when they opened it up
a gundam that could rewrite reality manipulate gravity and space and tear souls from bodies just to feed without the need for packs
  that one seemed to exhibit psychokinesis powers or something in the ova
  uso actually blocked a beam shot by shooting at it with the rifle so take that as you will
    loran did too so i wouldnt be surprised if one or two others have as well
        still not as impressive as kinkedo nau blocking a vsbr shot with 3 beam shields and a beam saber
  correction two beam shields    and even then the vsbr beam was strong enough that when he blocked it with his beam zanber it still shattered his eye sensors
  he just needs a more powerful beam saber no
  the zanber is already stronger than your average beam saber
   amuro is faced with a crisis he tries despite the futile the effort is and manages to pull a miracle that showed the warmth of human heart   crashes his zeta gundam in plane mode into the most evil manipulative and powerful newtype who in his petty rage turns him into vegetable   doesnt submits to haman despite his growing cynicism with ef   banagher is faced with a colony laser at his op status with psychoframe fuckery he does a kira yamato     unlike you i have actually seen those shows
  trying this hard  go back to playing with your dakimura
    whats even going on with those shields did the antagonist really just oblingingly shoot through two preplaced beam shields because thats what it looks like
  he threw them
  why not just dodge to the side at that point should be faster than throwing two shields and adjusting the saber
powerlevel wank thread but with gundam  303 posts 79 posters    i guess its true what they say about gundamfags
    how shit is the enemy pilot that he shot through the shields the other guy yad just thrown instead of waiting a half second to travel far enough that theyre noblonger directly between the him and his target how slow was his reaction that seabook can throw two beam shields out before the guy can pull a trigger
  dodging an f91
  in retrospect maybe that was the point since the guy immediately for the kill right after that
  goes

tfw all the rights to most of the showa godzilla films are owned by different companies at once  tfw i cant marathon all 30 godzilla films in their original japanese versions instead of americanized dubs from the showa era when being faithful to japanese version didnt matter  tfw ill never own all the films in japanese and in english sub in one complete collection  tfw final box is only available in japan and has no english subtitles and isnt on blueray and out of print    why is life so cruel lads
  why cant you just learn to read/speak japanese instead of wanting companies to clear up the mess and deliver a product that would cost them millions just so you can buy it for hundreds or dl it for free
godzilla is gay why watch a man in a rubber suit pretend to be a dinosaur
  why watch anything
  to escape the reality that im a weak reptillian in a rubber suit pretending to be human
  we got cgi now no need to watch godzilla when jurassic park does it so much better
  but those dinosaurs suck ass because they dont take the chance to be cool yeah sure trex is great but it doesnt breathe fire
  finally somebody had the balls to said it
you can get the majority of the collection with subs from madman entertainment australia i think its missing king kong vs godzilla and shin gojira which came out afterwards
  criterion collection has the rights to just about all of the showa godzilla films and sony has the rights to the 90s heisei films millennium films and shin godzilla  lionsgate has biollante kraken has gigan ebirah hedorah and 84 universal has king kong vs godzilla
  because life is suffering and there is no god
  criterion collection has the rights to just about all of the showa godzilla films  i thought they only had the rights to the first one    anyway king kong vs godzilla is forever trapped in rights hell in which the only version available to anybody outside japan is the dubbed one
  kiss asian has most of them and if enough people request the rest they might add the missing ones so technically you could
  which ones are missing
anyone have a kaiju mega folder
  ebirah destroy all monsters versus gigan and return of
showa is fucking dumb anyway
  get lost /tv/ go worship someone from channel awesome while we enjoy rubber suit fights
  nope they subliscensed most of the showa films and are probably working on the ones they dont have rumors are there will be a box set at some point and they might use the 4k upgrades of the films toho has been working on assuming they dont make their own they have rodan and war of the gargantuas too    how is king kong vs godzilla trapped wouldnt criterion just have to come some agreement with universal
  well considering the criterion bit is all news to me i no longer have any idea
  americanized dubs  but anon the ghttm and wotg american cuts are better than the original ones
  welp criterion has most of the classic showa minus sea monster hedorah and gigan but at the moment they are using the toho nuhd transfers and ghidrah has the cheese filter but they are rumors they are doing 4k restorations    kraken released the astonishing sony hd transfers for sea monster hedorah and gigan but sadly no mechagodzilla nor son of godzilla shame cause there will be no true hd versions of those transfers along their hd transfers of the japanese cuts of the columbia trilogy bios hman and mothra hman and mothra were in itunes in hd but only the us cuts and they are releasing bios and mothra in a dogshit crammed on 2 discs 4 movies in one budget dvd with episodes of zilla tas and that shit dub of astroboy 2003 wonderful and their release of g85 is the japanese cut but the us version will never see a proper hd releaseat least not by a company    biollante had a passable but bitrate starving bd by echo bridge and they were supposed to have extra features in a rerelease but it didnt    sony probably doesnt own their heisei titles anymore after releasing them on bd and most of the transfers were heh some of em were weird frankentransfers of the toho nuhd actual sony remaster footage and the international cuts for space godzilla and destoroyah    funi unfortunely owns shin and sadly their bd was meh with garbage non special feautures by some smucks who did a fucking watchmojo/screen junkies tier vlog video instead of i dont know the actual special features from the japanese bluray and part of the joke of shin is the japanese on screen text like no joke there is actually a point to have em trust me
  forgot kong and kong escapes are universal atm    also what will happen to atragon matango varan frankenstein conquers the world dogora and space amoeba
  the multiple companies thing wouldnt even be a problem since you can buy just about any of the movies dirt cheap these days except fucking godzilla vs mechagodzilla because sony are a bunch of lazy faggots who dont wanna reprint it for some reason
  llook how cool i am gguys
  im a gay and i want godzilla to rip my asshole apart as he thrusts into me with his thick muscular radioactive lizard thunder thighs while ifukube music plays at max volume in the background
  having the raw shin godzilla footage was such a bizarre choice either leave the japanese titles and sub them or have english titles having them only as a subtitle track is so ugly
  its okay m8 weve all been there
  they dont have the rights to it anymore
  seconding
  sony probably doesnt own their heisei titles anymore after releasing them on bd  whoa really
  how to spot shit taste
episode 8 assuming all townspeople are programs created by akane then the major outside presences in this digiverse would be akane yuuta the highschooler support gang and alexis    the only thing now is context  how did akane end up in the digiverse what prompted yuuta and the support gang to enter the world assuming they were the falling stars from ep 1s intro what are alexiss origins and endgame
  rikka is a npc
  what if akane is the npc she has control over the system because shes part of or rather the system
the others will come
  alexis
  not sure it will work if gridman and the gang goes to human size for the fucks
og gridman had a episode that hacked credit cards that turns cash registers into bombs  what the fuck
  theres an episode where takeshis shattered glass doppleganger manifests out of nowhere maybe the whole of ssssgridman is to explain that episode
i didnt know it at the time but it was profound
  i dont really see it
  gridman is right there though standing next to zero on the right and on the far left
crack theory  akane is possibly really the boy on the far right by utsumi and yuta in the opening photo aka akane is his virtual persona in the digital world you never see an instance of that guy when you see the class and akane is not in that photo which means that may be a photo from the real world he reinterprets the world and himself to reflect a world that he wants to be popular loved by all to be in complete control of his world    explains interests in kaiju/tokusatsu a rare interest for girls as noted by many characters  explains interest in rikka as the only one who will never hate him who he may have a crush on in real life  subtle hint in the form of gender bending cafe an idea that would ironically require akane to become a boy for the event which would contradict the very escapist ideals he seeks in the first place
   akane telling rikka that her kaiju made her aka she wasnt born aka she is not human gives more credibility to the theory that only akane and yuta are real humans and the rest is just kaijumade humans filler for gods city background noise so to say i bet if yuta gets his memory back he will remember that none of the people he bounded with is real and once akane somehow stops being a god they will all disappear or something like that
  akane is a shut in who hates social interactions but at the same time craves for attention and love
      they have to be real the npcs are evolving past whatever akane made them to do the teacher is suddenly very engaged with his students people notice gridman right away and panic on seeing him and people can suddenly see caliburn i dont think they are literally inside a computer i think they are in the real world but its been modified by those editor kaiju    personal theory is that akane had some kind of emotional meltdown when yuta confessed to rikka which aleksis was able to use as a power source to create all those editor kaijus you see everywhere and put akane in charge
裕太の六花に対するあのまどろっこしい感じわかりみがヤバイ
  i think they are in the real world but its been modified by those editor kaiju    the grid being in the sky above them and the fact that there is nothing beyond the cities borders begs to differ
  yuuta has a big penis and rikka loves it very much  nani
    first scene
  second scene    those two scenes being so close to each other made me feel like they are in opposition one is about fake friendship another is about some real tension rikka tries to suppress for some reason
  shes just angel from big o
  theyre not exactly in the real world but its not quite the comouter world either  akane doesnt have control over peoples actions or personality really she cant even make everyone love her as shown by the teachers apathy when he bumped on her  on the other hand it is true that people sing praises to her for no reason even her kaiju love is seen as cute by the arcadia dude and her classmates when the audio dramas imply that even a toku magazine is a creepy and disgusting thing for a teenager to have  anocilas 2nd does straight up say that akane is the ruler of that world and that she can use her kaiju to play with the city as she wills but she cant seem to edit peoples attitudes while she can edit their memories  theres also the bigger issue of the timeline  yuta has existed in akanes world for a while  gridman fought alexis and lost but only recently started appearing in akanes world  akanes world existed for a long time
  but its not quite the comouter world either  yeah it is did you not see the ceiling
this is what the viewers wanted to see
  akane is the overlord of this program and hibiki is the virus akane blatantly mentioned that everyone and everything is her creation hibiki is the wrench pest virus that has infiltrated akanes dreamworld now i am wondering whether or not we will actually see hibiki akane and others in the real world this is sao hack matrix
anyone got the link to the audio dramas with the subs or did they get nuked
  
  thanks
so the whole reason no one seems to want to do anything more direct about akane is because theyre literally programmed to be unable to
akane is running a corrupt unlicensed vr server which has altered her perceptions  hibiki is admin sent in to fix the problems and free her but got his perceptions and memories damaged by entering the server  alexis is the avatar of the damaged server trying to maintain his own existence without triggering the suppressed debug and protection softwares
  post pics pls
  thats the implication but despite that rikka went to preemptively apologize and agree to fight akane     the three core gridman alliance have rejected akanes temptations at this point    
one question does the green kaiju girl from episode 6 reference a transformers
  im not 100 but omeone said it was this itd be very fitting thematic if true 
  do you mean color scheme
does anyone know where to download or torrent the original gridman subbed im dying to see it now
  amazon prime has the official subs which drop in quality after episode 3 because they took and used msubs subs for those also nyaa has it just gotta limit the search to liveaction
  damn these references are fucking obscure
  amazon prime  i thought it was on toku a channel available through some cable systems or as an upcharge on amazon prime
tfw most doujins will be about trap yuta
  well      youre right its an upcharge or a separate thing for legit viewing
    shits great
  fuck this gay earth
  this rikka revelation puts a whole new light on the bikini scene she is basically forced into complimenting akanes skin and akane is toying with or tormenting her
  yfw doujins about yuta being forced to have sex with oldmans  akane will use her god power to happen
  remember that anocilas strongly implied that yuta is gridman akane might be the only real one
  i think hes talking about this kid

  what about him
yuuta is gridmans human form ala ultrasevens dan  gridman was tracking alexis when they entered akanes vr world  gridman as yuuta lived in there for a while to track alexis activities  alexis bonds with akane giving him enough strength to defeat gridman  gridman is broken apart but manages to save a backup as yuuta cue episode 1
ep9 preview dreams and thoughts    the kaiju that showed up in the city didnt do anything it just floated there akane messes with yuta and the others time in order to regain the world she envisioned disconnected from gridman yuta and co face their greatest crisis    script hasegawa keiichi  storyboard kai igarashi  episode director yoshiyuki kaneko    
when will red man show up to kill all of akanes kaiju collection
8 out of 12 episodes  still no yume no hero  i am dissapoint
  there was the instrumental version
so after episode 8 does this mean that futa is from the outside after all classics cliffjumper was a nonsg native was native cliffjumper/futa was killed in a kaiju attack and the futa we see is the mainverse version
  futa  hehehe ur funny
i found him
can someone post the episode synopsis leaks
  i want to see anocilas again
  pretty much one of the reasons why im watching this show
  akane messes with yuta and the others time in order to regain the world she envisioned  damage control
  i thought this was a plainold pigmon reference looks like im not going deep enough  whats the show on the bottom looks cosy
    what if its zegapain all over again
  theyre saving it for the finale
  why didnt yuta just grab akanes kaiju and fucking threw it on the ground
  because theres a literal alien walking around who might appear and wreck him for breaking the rules
  he did it just took a while
  the fact assist weapons got humanoid forms without the need for humans controlling them really gives some credibility to yuta  gridman theory  wonder what will happen in the end though i doubt all these people will ever leave the computer world so gridman may as well separate from yuta to allow him to live a normal life here
  mmm theres a green color scheme but thematically it doesnt fit that much  because while regular primus is good the inverse is super bad  like genocidally bad  hes the unicron equivalent    you dont see that kaiju girl destroying everything simply because its there right
  i can link you to a place you can watch those online    just need a good adblocker
  ha    ha
  she has primus colours  primus is god  shes expositioning to yuta how akane is god      how is that not thematic and dont put words in my mouth because i didnt say anything you typed besides it being thematic
why are /a/ threads so bad
  disconnected from gridman  what did they mean by this
  why do you think
  /a/ gridman threads boil down to waifu and yuri faggotry
  if he cant access junk he cant access gridman or hes defeated and expelled from gridman similar to what happened with max and berserkes
  i actually wonder if his primal acceptor is going to get physically removed so we will get the hand holding scene from the op
  cast in the name of dat ass
  ye tap that
  how did akane end up in the digiverse    my present theories she has powers alexis wants to cultivate/study for some nefarious end and the city was created by combining their powers either that or as his comments about only humans being able to create kaiju at the end of the seventh episode would suggest he wants to study humans for the purposes of creating an army of kaiju and akane was an ideal candidate he created the city in order to do this so not that different from the former    either way gridman and yuta are working together to fight aliens and yutas infiltration of akanes world is why he has amnesia     i wouldnt be surprised if yutas partnership with gridman was what inspired alexis to try and work with a human like akane either that or the reason akane didnt immediately realize that yuta was an outsider is that they knew each other previously gridman recruited yuta specifically because he knew akane and this yuta replaced the copy akane made and the process of doing this caused his amnesia
  i swear to god if this does turn out to be a glorified sg fanfiction
besides the original gridman are there any tokusatsu i should watch if i want to get more out of this show and get into toku in general     when i watch ssssgridman im generally enjoying myself but im also experiencing a sort of cultureshock i want to overcome that so i figured now as is good a time as any to finally dive into the genre
  its a deceptively large genre with a lot of different kind of themes and stuff
  gridman is an ultraman show in all but name im not familiar with ultra as a franchise though so i cant recommend good entries to start with    right now were in a very good age for kamen rider one of the longrunning tokusatsu franchises if you want to get into this franchise id go to ozclive and grab the series batch for kamen rider w the first rider show of the 2010s and a good sampler of what the franchise has been like for the past decade if you like what you see watch the next rider ooo and keep moving forward    super sentai is the third member of the big three and while its currently in a state of decline theres still over forty years of shows to go back to a frequent recommendation is samurai sentai shinkenger which is about ten years old at this point but still relatively modern sentai is the franchise that power rangers takes its footage from and while its somewhat better than its adaptations in general its still aimed at the youngest audience of the big three
  if you want an ultrabased show similar to gridman id recommend ultraman tiga ultraman max or ultraman mebius to start id say go for max but thats just me also asking in the /m78/ thread  here will probably yield better results
utsumi is ___
  better question is when yuta and utsumi were asking akane to postpone the kaiju appearance at the school  why didnt they just rape her
  shit youre right this show is gonna merit a rewatch once its over
  didnt the original gridman end with the computer and real world merging taking the shape of a city in the sky
  they are not burgers
  no it ended with the kids destroying khan digifer and gridman saying goodbye to them
  a nerd
  right he was right in the argument with rikka when everyone thought he was an asshole for some reason
  getting his shins kicked
whats he smiling about
  he finally got someone to give him their phone number
    caliburs guilty pleasure is making prank calls
    ultraman is kind of drifted towards the same toy formula that made decade and gokaiger successful financially one thing to love about recent ultras is that they arguably were the only tv tokusatsus that dabble with traditional special effects on a weekly basis    even though they uses a lot of cg like rider and sentai did you can still see practical effects like building gets blown off ground gets demolished dirt bounces up when the ultra falls down and running     even sentai with their robot battles very very very rarely destroys building nowadays if you see their battle its just building as sets monsters and robots punches some sparks here and there and the finisher is cg beam with actual and sometimes cg explosions    as for suggestions there are some but for modern ultras tiga is the best place to start moebius is good too if you want to learn the basic lore of the ultramens
just watched the first og gridman episode in the og series gridman cant hear what the kids say so they have to type ssss they just talk so i think was forshadowing for the merged computer world in ssss
  just watched the first og gridman episode  youre gonna have to watch more they get a voice module in like 3 or 4 iirc that lets them talk with words
  they both had valid points and the other characters were annoyed with him for insulting rikka not because of his argument utsumi didnt even want to try talking it out with akane because a hes a nerd that thinks in terms of kaiju fights and b hes too nervous to try confronting akane upfront without being pushed to
  here my friend
  he thought it was pointless to try talking akane out of the fight after she challenged them directly like that and he was right as they try talking her anyway and she completely disregards them  his insult towards rikka was that she wasnt thinking about the situation rationally which she wasnt what was rikkas valid point exactly that they should fight akane because shes her friend when you find out your friend is a serial murderer maybe theyre not the person you thought they were i guess that was her programming talking though so whatever
    gridman himself and individual assist weapons are pretty decent the gattai though
  im thinking along the lines of alexis and gridman both being part of an ultralike interdimensional peacekeeping force and alexis going rogue like ultraman belial they fight and accidentally fall into the virtual space created by a lonely borderline suicidal girl alexis realizes he can use this to his advantage and bonds with the girl because beings like him and gridman dont have the imagination to make kaiju that sets humans apart from them
dont lie how many of you would have just killed akane after learning she is behind making kaiju and killing people what would kamen rider do
  i would challenge her to a 1v1 cqc fight
  hand to handit is the basis of all combat
  hitting a girl  youve got to prove your superiority by fighting her kaiju hand to hand
this anime would be better without the girls theyre absolute shit
  they also attract a lot of cancerfag
  go to /a/ gridman threads  nothing but arguments about the two main girls with a lot of talk about lewd topics  new episode is rarely discussed   its pretty funny to be honest they can go on and on about whos feet is the stinkiest between rikka or akane but anything plot related is instantly ignored such a huge contrast when you check out /m/ gridman threads
  indeed the guys are better
if you look carefully youll notice a king joe figure
  rikkas existential crisis is a pretty cool plot point though
  does the ssss stand for syber straight shota squad
  i also recognise inpelaizer and galactron but im not sure of the others  i also liked how mecha ghoulghilas had windom eyes that was neat
  in black convoy colors
  maybe in the final episode kahn assumes control of the entire computer world and his digital power begins to leak from takeshis computer and manifest in reality where it then begins to open a portal for digifier to escape through onto the other side hes defeated but the final shot is the kids looking up as gridman disappears into a vision of the computer world in the sky    i probably wasnt meant to imply much as its all pretty vague and unassuming but i can see trigger twisting that imagery into something more meaningful
  superhuman samurai syber squad
  syber super saber squad
  shin seki shugaku sei
  in the first episode they had to type as well only after upgrading did they become able to speak to him directly
        im hours late but i just wanted to say thank you all for pointing me in the right direction and giving me an idea of what to expect i decided to start with tiga max seems interesting but id probably get more out of it if i watched other ultraman series first also picked up kamen rider w and samurai sentai shinkenger because of that anons suggestion and kuuga because it seemed interesting
  i decided to start with tiga  tiga is a slowburner it takes a while for it to build up the first like 10 episodes are boring    if you want something thats good right off the bat  short  sweet i recommend ultraseven x
shin seki shugaku sei    theres an interview that where they had already started ssss gridman before they got a hold of the westeren adaptation to check it out so at this point its safe to say that ssss refering to super human samurai syber squad is a coincidence
blocks your path
  when are we getting visuals for god zenon
  in the opening
  they were probablyaware of it even if they hadnt seen it    and  shin seki shugaku sei  only works if it is a refrences to super human samurai syber squad since otherwise it would be chugaku
  im fine with slowburners so ill stick with tiga but thanks for the suggestion
  dont take the bait from   ultraseven x is a clueless series the show itself didnt even know what it is trying to be
  np      ultraseven x is a clueless series the show itself didnt even know what it is trying to be  people lie on the internet more at 11
  you are a fucking idiot
  the best way to start is to go through some old godzills films after that you should watch kamen rider i recommend almost anything including and after kamen rider w just pick a suit you like the look of the most and give it 5 episodes
  yeah enjoy your 24 minutes full of boringness in ultraseven x
  thats pretty much what happened in the original series except kahn digifer was an invader and takeshis kaiju were on his computer in a virtual castle    gridman was just a ball of light that took the form of ippeis 3d wireframe kahn apqeared in takeshis computer    ssss is like a slight twist on that
  it was we saw the boys programming break when akane tried to seduce yuta by molesting a pillow and whats his face lying about yuta being gridman
  i recommend ultraseven x  why do you do this dont do this
  max seems interesting but id probably get more out of it if i watched other ultraman series first  you might but its great on its own it was my first ultra series and i got hooked
  shut up
  i recommend ultraseven x  shit taste
  why bonerjpg
  hey thanks ill look for a place to download ultraman and mebius  also is it possible for someone to make a stitch of the full power full power gridman dorado
say something to the hyper agent gridman
  interesting that hasegawa the writer of gridman sss was heavily involved in the first season and was only second to the main writer in overall number of episodes written though he also wrote the first season finale rd
  hes shiny
still waiting for ahsmb to sub 11 77 and 88
  handsome
  29 comes with bluray 1 3 more for the rest of the blurays
  so what did utsumi see
  his head is bigger in real life than i imagined
  anime proportions its even more ridiculous in those photos with a suit actor in it standing next to one in the original gridman suit
  
  so which design do you prefer /m/
  soul vs souless
  left head right body
  i just want the main theme with the trumpets and everything sounds so nice
  the ssss suit looks a bit off are the head and shoulders that big in the show
  yeah he tried to kill him with a box cutter which is heavily tied into akanes character she should use an actual craft knife but she uses a box cutter to sculpt kaiju
repostan from /a/    the characters all have gaps between their appearances and true natures yuta is the hero but he is also cute like a little kid rikka looks like a distant cool beauty but she is very kind and caring akane is girly and cute but also a sociopath   they didnt want to make just a hero anime but also a story of the youth of boys and girls  they talk about the constant fights between utsumi and rikka neither is wrong because rikka isnt a unlikable woman and utsumi isnt a dumb nerd  the two points of view of rikka and utsumi are correct even if the ultramanfan staff agrees with utsumi thats not all there is rikkas attempts to understand akane differently are also important   they try to depict the four main characters as flawed even if that might make people dislike them  rikka and akane are the heroines of the story but they have nonheroinelike qualities that make them authentic   before he lost his memories yuta and rikka had certain conversation is it important maybe but are the feelings of current yuta the same as the previous yuta  amemiya actually likes the sense of distance from rikka he doesnt think a heroine that lives for mc would be good  the romance is definitely a part of the story and yuta likes rikka but that doesnt mean it needs to end well youll have to keep watching to the end  the kaijuu are all designed in a way that fits akanes character and her mental state at that point of the story  they wanted a rival character so they came up with anti to make him more sympathetic they made akane treat him like shit  rikka taking care of anti was meant to evoke mixed feelings in the audience its building to something and it shows rikkas kindness but also why is she so nice to anti but then treats yuta and utsumi in a totally different way laughs rikka is weak to people that seen as if theyre in need
  in a way the character relationships are what shape the story that akane and rikkas houses are so close is nice rikka and akane are physically near but at the same time theyre emotionally distant if they were actually close then the story would endthematically sure but also practically because akane would discover gridmans body and rikka would discover how the kaijuu are made but because they arent emotionally open with each other the story continues  look forward to the remaining kaijuu because theyre going to be getting more and more insane with each passing episode  pay attention to the state of akanes smartphone with each episode she is hurting herself more and more when akane wants to kill someone else is it them that she is angry at or is she actually angry at herself they say that akane is more dangerous than takeshi from the original because akane is more broken as a person  what kind of insane kaijuu will the increasingly more broken akane create look forward to it
  in the latest interview the director and writer are saying that rikka is going to approach yuuta and close the distance between them    end
  they try to depict the four main characters as flawed even if that might make people dislike them  i have to praise this aspect of the show the characters irritate me sometimes but theres still something likeable in all of time im excited to see what the future holds in store for them
  so ep10 or 11
    for the past 8 weeks i thought this show was 2 cours
   romance is definitely a part of the story and yuta likes rikka but that doesnt mean it needs to end well youll have to keep watching to the end  well now we know how itll end
  absolutely this it makes these characters feel like real teenagers and i love that even if its sometimes frustrating
  rikkas gonna get niad
  i feel like theres something ironic about a ssssgridman phone case when the show goes out of its way to depict an overinfatuation with phones in an often negative way
  japanese children are obsessed with phones
  but is rikka going to be the nia in this situation or the simon
  gotta play that f/go
  nia rikka is an npc programmed by akane
  or is she
  so says akane  im still not certain how the preamnesia tension thing is going to turn out could be a big shock on that front
  hasegawa helps make great mysterious cities
  this rikka revelation puts a whole new light on the bikini scene she is basically forced into complimenting akanes skin and akane is toying with or tormenting her  yeah episode 4 too
  because they took and used msubs subs for those  has anyone heard of this or is this anon off their meds
  i compared the two and aside from a couple grammar changes a comma changed here an ellipsis added here etc its the same its very obvious even without checking because they go from saying kahn digifier ep13 to kahndegifur ep4 and beyond
  nice
  because they go from saying kahn digifier ep13 to kahndegifur ep4 and beyond  also you know because episode 4 has some of the worst quality subtitles ive ever read thats probably a bigger clue
    the other support weapons are very clear about yuta being a human though
what do you think about hibiki yuta so far
    keiichi hasegawa the main writer for ssssgridman has done a ton of other tokusatsu work he was the main writer for ultraman dyna and nexus both of which are highly recommended he also did work on some kamen rider series i believe it was w double and drive
  nothing
  i wanna tease him constantly until hes red all over like anocillas
    theres a kaiju from great/towards the future in there i dont recognize the others     theyre all mecha kaiju appropriately
  they might not know the whole truth either they say themselves that theyre far from complete just like gridman
  that too but thats too general
    that is true     i still think yuta is a human from outside the computer world though
  hes pretty alright doesnt blow me away but hes a decent lead when they finally gave him some stuff to work with after the couple episodes following the first one actually focused on rikka more than him and hes very cute shouldve shown him crossdressing more
  he is the only an interesting and useful character between the three principals rikka and utsumi really suck at supporting yuta compared to ippei and yuka with naoto to me theyre dead weight
  i think the trio has a pretty realistic relationship given the circumstances the original three were best friends from the getgo after all plus i dont think utsumi and rikka are useless theyre definitely making a difference no matter how far their influence can possibly reach yuta makes it clear to rikka in this last episode that shes important and im sure he feels the same about utsumi on some level
  actually focused on rikka more than him  only waifu and yuri fags believe it please go back to your board
  another
  yuta really deserves a better team the support weapons are all god tier allies but the core team sucks utsumi nearly got him killed with the muh kaiju are humans shit and he doesnt even register as a blip on rikkas radar given the loss of his memories and the stress of risking his life fighting kaiju im surprised yuta hasnt had a complete breakdown yet guys tougher than he looks
  why dont you fuck off first if youre so familiar with the opinions on that board
  i think its selfexplanatory repostan from /a/      its a nice show but ssssgridman definitely has the worst fanbase related to tokusatsu series of all time     tokusatsu has always been about heroes and villains and a guy characters who turns turn into a superhero superheroes to defeat them but unfortunately autistic anime fags keep desperately introducing and projecting their anime faggotry waifu and yuri into the show not to mention that they blindly believe that ssssgridman is a generic high school girl drama and/or a yuri show about two generic high school girls who are not even action characters or participate in battles anime fags are pathetic and not worthy of any sympathy
  he becomes tougher with each episode if anything
  the worst fanbase related to tokusatsu series of all time  hahahahahahahahahaha
  rikkas eroi body
  kamen rider would have her be an evil rider so she can protect herself    not that that would work against me
  anime fags are pathetic and not worthy of any sympathy  its hard to disagree with this since 90 of the fans are  males who self insert as a cute girl   males who turn two straight girls into lesbians for shipping them  males underestimating and shitting on male characters with memes and buzzwords while overrating cute girls with waifufaggotry
  gridman is my waifu
  do you actually have opinions of your own or do you just keep reposting copypasta all the time
its hard to believe that /a/ is more retarded than /m/ but here we are
  if he keeps steadily improve and continue to outplay akane like he did in episode 8 he will turn out to be a really good protagonist
  i love how yuuta is showing his complete dominance over rikka and akane ruining the /u/fags day
  i actually noticed that while rikka seems to do everything akane asks of her she keeps silent about yuta when akane directly asks her about it i thought it was just awkwardness but after this episode it feels like gridmans influence somehow allows her to breach the programming when it comes to him
    rikka  licca doll  deepest
  rikka  licca  my god it was in front of us the entire time we were too busy looking at all the transformers references to notice
i want to marry calibur
  did m subs even finish gridman i thought they only did a few episodes there was an anon who ripped the whole series off amazon prime that was the first time the whole series was available on torrent sites with subs
      gridfranxx
is this show good so far
  yes also it aint so far as in were halfway through its a 1 cour show itll be ending in a few episodes
  cool havent had time to check it out so far so im out of the loop
  did m subs even finish gridman  it was never intended to be a project they were going to finish the first episode was a one off the second and third episodes were made using commissioned scripts someone had sitting around
  is it though
  for sure
  hes a nice kid and i hope his feelings dont get hurt
  shes a gold digger so id make a fair shot
  nice fanfiction
  creator detected  loading response script    of course
  3x smelly hobo  imagine the smell
  also arent they npcs too thanks to that raven dlc
  are those the kids from abenobashi or am i mixing them up with someone else
  nice mantits redman
  yes
  i dont know you tell me satan
  whose subbing groups release should i watch theres 3 working on it
  i thought they only did a few episodes  they only did the first three which is why i said toku stopped using them because thats all there is
  horriblesubs and erairaws just rip from cr  asenshigjmpas uses cr script as a base but edits it a bit and does some typesetting mostly noteable is they translate text messages though there arent a lot of them
  alright thanks bro
  they only did the first three which is why i said toku stopped using them because thats all there is  i thought you were saying everything after the first three was msubs which is my mistake but you should know toku does not provide subs for their ultra shows tsuburaya does
quite literally just the character
  takeshi is /ourguy/ you shut your whore mouth
  takeshi no
  am i out of touch    no its the thots who are wrong
  this guy becomes a gridman
  hyoer agent standards are a bit on the low side
  he stops being lonely and depressed so its okay
so i compiled a list of takeshis autism in each episode of the original gridman    1 he cant give yuka his love letter   2 no reason given he just comes home sperging out  3 he cant get on the payphone and yuka bump into him but he cant give yuke his love letter again  4 he hacks a smart car because the guy on tv claims the car is unhackable  5 he got run over by a grocery guy with a cart of orange boxes and people laughed at him  6 he spergs out at a music store for having music that interrupted his moping  7 he cant give yuka his love letter again while yuka is shopping for cake ingredients  8 he gets inspired by a comment about brothers   9 he fucks up a test and gets only 57th place  10 he makes a fool of himself at a water fountain and start hording bottled water  11 a kid run into him in a supermarket but the mom defends the kid from him which makes takeshi mad about money because his parents only ever gives him money  12 a thief broke into his house but was scared away by digifer the thief bumps into takeshi on the way out of the house  13 the local gym trainer offers him gym membership  14 his alarm clock didnt work  15 he gets kicked out of the arcade for hogging a vr shooting game  16 two cops harass him when he was going home at night  17 he gets mad because the protagonists befriends a hacker who turned out to be a crippled kid  18 he gets inspired by a mummy exhibition  19 his gravure magazine with his kaiju sketches got confiscated by the cops  20 his cg paint wasnt appreciated by some art critic
  21 he had a nightmare  22 he gets jealous of a dinosaur excavation  23 no reason again he was already in the process of making a new one to get revenge on gridman  24 he bought flowers for yuka but fucks up the part of giving the flowers to her  25 he gets mad about chimney smoke almost got run over by a truck whose driver spew some more emission smoke at him he actually wins this one  26 second part from the previous episode  27 a kids tank toy hit him with some paint ball  28 he takes some creep shots of yuka but found out she was not smiling for him but for naoto  29 a dog barked at him and made him run into a noodle delivery man  30 a love fortune telling machine make him act like a fool   31 he tries to kid the ball back to a bunch of kids and make a fool out of himself and drops a floppy of digifers consciousness on the road  32 he steps on gum gets beat up by the guy when he calls him out for littering he actually wins for once and make the bully fucks off  33 his good doppleganger shows up   34 he gets jumped on the way home by some deliquents   35 gets mad because yuka is nice to everyone but him this episode was lewd as fuck  36 he cant break into the computer system of a new mall thats supposedly unhackable so he creates a kaiju to wreck it  37 he got busted for public urination by a jerk cop so digifer and he create a monster that rewrote the constitution and mind controlled all the cops  38 he created a monster that caused a trash pile up digifer finally has enough of his shit and abandon takeshi  39 no more takeshi autism he finally fess up and man up
  he makes a fool of himself at a water fountain  he just didnt like how the water tasted  which makes takeshi mad about money because his parents only ever gives him money  he just got mad that he got caught trying to steal the card the kid had
  4 he hacks a smart car because the guy on tv claims the car is unhackable  he was literally asking for it
  37 he got busted for public urination by a jerk cop so digifer and he create a monster that rewrote the constitution and mind controlled all the cops  fucking amazing
  37 he got busted for public urination by a jerk cop so digifer and he create a monster that rewrote the constitution and mind controlled all the cops  jesus christ what
    a lot of these are amazing
      akane has a lot to live up to thats one hell of a legacy she better start sperging like theres no tomorrow in the remaining episodes
  i mean episode 1 she killed an entire squadron of chicks because they accidentally knocked food that she was literally giving away out of her hand thats a pretty good start
  14 his alarm clock didnt work  you forgot the part where he then sends a monster to greenwich that fucks with ot only every clock in the world but also the actual flow of time and humanitys perception of it  32 he steps on gum gets beat up by the guy when he calls him out for littering  that he sends a monster into an automated vacuum cleaner which then goes around shrinking litterers and sucking them up  28 he takes some creep shots of yuka but found out she was not smiling for him but for naoto  and that this monster somehow lets him trap yuka inside his video camera so he can keep her all to himself    takeshi is /ourguy/
  35 gets mad because yuka is nice to everyone but him this episode was lewd as fuck  feels like amemiya is specifically poking at this with rikka
  this episode was lewd as fuck  you can say that again almost had to be put on a list after seeing yuka dolled up like a punk  its okay because shes like 40 now rright
  29 a dog barked at him and made him run into a noodle delivery man  i dont get nearly enough chances to use this pic  33 his good doppleganger shows up   man the ending to that was intense
    yeah and they arrest naotos dad for not driving over the speed limit which is a capital offence now so hes given the electric chair
tfw akane dissapears in the final episode like all the other trigger shit shows  i dont know if it will be good or bad but holy shit i dont want this to happen again for the fourth fucking time  only little witch academia the only trigger show without a shitty sacrifise even luluco has one
  in luluco it werent permanent and they meet several years later  trigger probably werent keen on the idea of nova fucking the 13 years olds brains out
  thats cute
  id be v e r y happy if akane dies fuckin murderous psychopath just because shes le moe haha animuuu 33 xddd doesnt mean she can keep getting away with all the petty murder scottfree even takeshi turned over a new leaf eventually but akane wont for sure
  oh come on anon im sure youd sic a kaiju on your sim city citizens too when an npc acts out of line
  fuck off npc
  theres a myriad of ways for them to redeem akane especially if she starts being a good girl towards yuta and his team in the later episodes like that adorable animator comic strip shows  they are most likely going for she is thoroughly manipulated by alexis and considers everyone an npc but the truth will break her because she is a good person and she will try her hardest to redeem herself route
  sounds like female otaku but reversed
  conveniently leave out the shipperfags that selfinsert as the mc
  wait  wasnt that the joke
  theyre gay
    redman art is my favorite art
  19 his gravure magazine with his kaiju sketches got confiscated by the cops  id go on an autistic rampage if that happened to me
  theyre called pecs and he could crush a kaijus head in them with a single flex
  pecs are not that pointy
how hard you will lose your shit if he shows up at some point  or is he the fucking calibur to begin with
  ill only lose if the music when he shows up is baby dan dan in all its cheesy glory
ssssgridman is a sequel to og gridman    akane is khan digifer who was imperfectly reconstructed postshattering at the end of the original show by having his data cobbled together    thinking himself human and trapped in the computer world still he creates a simcity out of sheer boredom and dream to have his own world to control like in the original series using his memories of the real world and the people within it as a reference he models himself partially out of takeshi since he was the only human he had longterm contact with    og gridman comes back to btfo him again to really make sure he doesnt terrorize the real world again only to be intercepted  possibly shattered on when he got there by alexis hence the scattered lights we saw in the beginning theyre gridmans fragments a fellow criminal of digifers    upon restoration and we know gridman can restore himself after defeat like when anti first beat him gridman lost most of his memories but remembers the host he had to merge with to carry out his 2nd mission on earth yuta akane/digifer didnt know about his presence because alexis pretty much beat him as soon as he got there and found a host    seeing this the hyper agents hq sent reinforcements in the form of the neon genesis junior high schoolers    everyone else is an npc created by akane with their own fictional memories and lives    alexis probably had caught wind of digifers actions in the first series and attempted to do the same thing as him but from a different angle by using akane/neodigifer as a pawn and didnt want gridman to get in the way he probably kept gridmans existence a secret from akane so she wouldnt grasp his true intent or become too suspicious of him     i cant quite work out the details of his base motives though
  couple of notes  the reason why digifer and gridman can restore themselves after death is because theyre beings of pure energy and energy cannot be destroyed but that has its own consequences both digifer and gridman lost their memories after restoration    also kaijuloli is remnant data of a kaijuu from the og series roaming the computer world before digifer decided to ripoff simcity
  i think its more likely alexis is the same type of criminal as khan digifier and is slowly goading akane into building him a strong enough kaiju body to break out into the real world gridman heard of him and tried to take him down but he and the assist weapons were still too weak after facing down khan digifier and he didnt have naoto and friends to help him
  i think its more likely alexis is the same type of criminal as khan digifier and is slowly goading akane into building him a strong enough kaiju body to break out into the real world    its quite possible though if ssss operates on the same principles as og gridman then all alexis needs to take form in the real world is a portal that leads from the computer world to our dimension like what happened with that kaiju in episode 2 i think of og gridman
  also  khan digifer  khan  akhane  akane
  it may be that alexis is lying low right now cause his defeat of thunder gridman also weakened him and he needs a stronger body for when sigma comes after him
  if gridman sigma is canon i would nut so fucking hard i really really really really want hyper agent takeshi make an appearance
  what is with all this redman art    is there any art of the characters in non shattered glass colours or other tranaformer repaints
cant bend knee
  what do you expect the armor literally goes over gridmans knee joint in the show his articulation is just anime bullshit
  i see zenons face peeking out there
  the reason why digifer and gridman can restore themselves after death is because theyre beings of pure energy and energy cannot be destroyed  were beings of pure matter which cannot be destroyed either and yet that doesnt make us immortal you doofus
  ntr setup from episode 4  beach episode from 5  qt kaiju deito from 6  bath scene from 7  train scene from this ep  if they waste all of these scenarios just to rape yutas boipuss i swear to god
no one discuss the transformers references  the absolute state of 4channel /a/
  theyve been discussed to death and this isnt /a/ you retard
do you guys want this to get a second season
  only if there are lingering plot threads by the end that could merit a sequel
  i do feel like 12 eps is too short but yeah what  said we need to see the ending first
  it outright uses a lot of plot notes from gridman f which states that alexis and khan are completely unrelated and alexis is a demon
  the previous episode fucked over with sakuragaokas water supply by adding lots of chlorine making takeshi a terrorist in the process    the shopping game of the terror is a little bit tame but still what the fuck indeed
in the time you spent watching the horrible cuck shit 0083 you could have watched a masterpiece like mellowlinks
not watching both since they are takahashis masterpieces  at least you have quite the good taste anon
why does the boy spread jam across his face
  why does katejina spread butter across her face
  revenge its all for revenge
masterpiece  shitty heroic drama
    mellowlinks was ok but its no votoms episode 3 therefore it can hardly be called a masterpiece
  we cant all be votoms episode 3 but what really matters is that we aspire to do so
mellowlink has an absolute banger of an ed  
  organs
    whats so special about votoms ep 3
   
toshiro tsuchida was producer for assault suits valken and is referred to as the creator of the series after the game he joined gcraft and was weriter/producer for front mission so he is likely a cocreator of front mission too     so two seemingly unrelated mecha series had similar creators
  is that why gun hazard was so similar to valken
  is that why gun hazard was so similar to valken    well tsuchida himself did not directly work on gun hazard but it is clearly an attempt to make an asv style game out of front mission     gun hazard did have asv devs hideo suzuki was programmer for asv and directed gun hazard
    is that a random lp or actual people who are going to give real explanations or anything
  the first episode goes into detail about the series in japan localization differences etc after that its a mix of guys bullshitting on the couch and informative discussion
what does /m/ think about iron blooded orphans
mixed bag    watching it weekly was like having my nails pulled increasing the pace by marathoning episodes would probably be a better way to watch it    worth it in the end for orga memes
  awesome premise and worldbuilding    very enjoyable combat scenes    melodramatic main characters and shit dialogue ruin a lot of it     gallerhorn did nothing wrong
was it really worth making another fucking thread about this crap    maybe i need to rewatch but i felt a lot of the space battles were flat due to the nature of the combat plus the questionable sound effects what was your favorite fight     i marathoned season 1 it doesnt help it much
  watch youtube fights it makes you feel like an ova might fix the series     and i watched up to getting the second gundam the dropped but binged after the season was done  it helps
    i suspect only people who watch youtube compilations of fights instead of actually watching mecha think ibo had good combat scenes
  if you dont understand the universe you dont appreciate mikazuki potatoing himself in the best fights
  m8 just link me the fight you liked the most my big issue with them is it seems like most space fights were   joust  unsatisfying metal noise  back apart  joust again   interspersed with far too many cockpit shots for them to talk too long
  i dont appreciate the way hes fine when plugged into anal vaginal system the but is otherwise a cripple for unexplained reasons
squandog millionaire the animation it had a setting and premise that the shows story simply couldnt live up to
mars union might end up as a nationalist republic with several massive space colonies between mars and saturn earth meanwhile is united under a plutocracy lead by seven of the earths most wealthy corporations ironically mimicking old gjallarhorns rule   and democratic gjallarhorn is struggling to maintain its neutral role in policing everyone else as the earth and mars have begun to steadily increase their political clout with the organisation      that last point especially what ever happened to the triangular cut in panels showing the pilots talking while the rest of the screen shows the ms doing its thing
  i dont mind an occasional full cockpit shot either but have it show something show us amuro being thrown around in the seat even with the harness show us a control sequence more complicated than pushing an ambiguous joystick why is this even needed with a neural link
  so did anyone invent some ahab signature seeking missile you point it locks on to the specific signature pull the trigger watch enemy mobile suit get blown apart use repeatedly on enemy warships for maximum fun
  i think part of the issue was removing all energy based weaponry all they used were bullet fed guns and metallic weapons but thats also arguably a good thing
  the same could be said for minovsky and anything else its just not practical inuniverse to include a vision system and tracking computers into a missile in almost any gundam series i would have loved a wellexecuted mostlymelee series exia is my favorite gundamtype ms but ibos animationsaving dust clouds and just notgreat choreography and sound design really work against it give me more than a bad clang and a dust cloud
one of the better aus not as good as 00 or x but better than seed age or wing
imagine if mikazuki had to fight off a red extra armoured graze armed with several megamachine cannons superheated tomahawks and carrying multiple supernapalm bazookas and a shoulder mounted howitzer not grazeein but more like a psycho full armor graze
  imagine if mikazuki ever fought a challenging opponent
  that one shot of ein screaming while his body is just limp  only good thing out of the whole show and its just left like that ein could have had great development as he might find more or less autism having to adjust to being in a robot body but he just gets shoved into a black box and is never heard from again
  x was the worst au
  did we watch the same show we got to see a notuc where notamuro failed a competent oldtype protagonist almost no stock footage and a pretty decent supporting cast witz and roybea are probably some of my favorite side characters across the franchise
i find the lack of hyper bazooka innovation to bedisturbing
  its mostly sensory data that passes through the link also do you want ggundam because that is how you get ggundam
  whats next a new type of shoulder mounted railgun that while smaller than the dainsleif launchers where you replace the entire fucking arm or have to transform to fire effectively are still devastating to anything it points at and can be fired several times before reloading or some bullshit particle weapon system that somehow finally manages to crack the nanolaminate armor question
  s1 i enjoyed while s2 was a drag like mikazuki and akihiro though akihiro seemed to be the better of the two and should have been the mc most of the ms were meh besides t h i c c boi and some of the gundam frames also wish calamity war was used more into the story then mentioned or just for the mobile armor and gundam frame that didnt do shit
  i like looking at pics of graze green ones ie  thats the only good thing i can say about it
  gundam wing of this generation i hate gundam wing
  neural link is not at all required to be like g gundam iirc in armored core 4 the pilot is basically curled up in a ball inside breathable water to reduce g forces
decided to give it a shot when it aired on toonami despite my disinterest with gundam was enjoying it but they went way too tryhard with mikazukis emotionless edgy demeanor couldnt stand him
  i got tired of it about halfway through season 1 its a pity because i still think the first episode is one of the best setups for any anime i have in memory
  though i really like the designs ibo hgs are a lot of fun to build too
  hopefully his son will be less of an emotionless robot once he stars as a major in the martian defence corps
i stopped watching halfway through way too boring and edgy but not the worst gundam or anything like that
   so youre trying to be sarcastic right if so you should know that the ahab particle compression technology used for the gamma nanolaminate sword was supposedly so difficult to pull off that only a handful of them exist while its the most elegant solution in a sense simply canceling out nanolaminate is kind of unnecessary against mobile suits or ships when repeated application of napalm big melee weapons or sectional density can already achieve that effect    the highest tech in the setting is all geared towards defeating mobile armors and for good reason who thought it was a good idea to make them autonomous and selfrepairing we may never know but he was probably among the first to die
if the damn super napalm can melt away nanolaminate with repeated applications what are the chances of some nutjob coming up with a napalm bazooka that utterly fails to work because he forgot to make the warhead penetrate the armor then explode
  that 100 should already exist but against mobile suits it seems overkill when they really are getting by with high caliber guns and melee weapons ammo probably wouldnt be produced after the calamity war    id imagine it would be used by support teams to weaken a mobile armor so that a striker could swoop in and finish the job
  overkill against mobile suits but against warships  warhead penetrates hull of ship  detonates releasing super napalm payload inside the ship  also perfect way to set up homage to infamous bazooka headshot
  it was fun and the end was great
  i liked it
  im beginning my first rewatch of it id have to say its got a good world and premise and even some good characters and great mobile suits barbatos still is one of my favorite gundams as well as the ending being my alltime favorite gundam ed    the story tho is sometimes boring and slow when i first viewed it i didnt completely follow the story so i ended up having to look up what had happened /
  completely pointless
waste of setting and ms design
  zoomer pandering trash
  arguably a good thing  except not really because the way it was animated like they throw some projectile using catapult that land on target instantly without leaving any smoke or heat trails
  now that you mention it i never see if they ever have missile or any rocket weaponry in that world
ibo was good ive watched about every gundam series and i found ibo refreshing its aware of many of the ridiculous stuff that goes on in gundam and makes an attempt to do things a bit different i like that mika just kills the people he fights instead of talking about how we should all get along the whole series is makes a attempt to give the audience something different by being a little bit more realistic with the gundam tropes when you have people doing dumb shit like climbing out of their robots to give speeches the main character kills them for this the char clone gets gets out foxed because his intentions are way to obvious the smart dude with the army wins and the out come that we all were expecting happened to tekkadan actually happened without any shark jumps
  napalm bazooka anyone cause you need a way to kill a warship without wasting the precious dainsleifs just fire at the hull and watch the super napalm spread inside the ship roasting everyone in its path
it sucked
  there were a few mobile suits had rocket launchers the export graze had head rockets and the halfbeaks used rockets    there was no guided weapons in the setting though      battleships shouldnt of had a problem with the armor they could of just upgunned them to the point where it would work     the settings take on armor was inconsistent standard ms rifles had a decent chance of working against the armor in most scenes but instead of getting something slightly more powerful they went straight to giant railguns with special ammo that required a second mobile suit to load
what 
kotobukiya can do whatever they want  dougram kinda had something similar in the form of the specialized aquatic landing boats meant to carry landbased combat armors
    i have to give them praise for diverting expectations when i saw the mecha form i thougth it was yet another fighter mecha but nope it turns into boaty mcboatface
  its actually a more feasable concept than flying mecha too though not by much
  reminds me of the destroid turrets from macross
  has there ever been an anime or manga about a youth who discovers a powerful boat and uses it to fight against the boats of an oppressive regime in order to secure peace and freedom for his people    and i dont mean /ships/ like yamato nadesico etc etc    i mean like all the tropes of gundam/dougram/layzner/dragonar/etc but with primarily single seat boats of some sort    its interesting how theres quite a bit of submarine anime super atragon blue noah blue submarine submarine 707r i started a thread ages ago trying to catalog all of them and there was a good list    but i cant think of a single anime specifically about boats boats on the ocean not a spaceship that might occasionally float but an actual proper boat that doesnt go underwater or fly
  boats alone usually arent considered /m/ enough to be adapted into such fiction good luck finding one
  faster knightboat we have to catch those starfish poachers
  isnt gundam x boatbased i havent watched it though
  can someone link me the hlj page for this im having trouble finding it    its just retarded enough i might order it i like boats and mecha seems neat and dumb my kinda thing    that is assuming its snap together i have the modelling skills of an easily frustrated opossum
if it is from kotobukiya it is good  if it is not from kotobukiya it is stupid    as always
  frame arms kongo
      its snaptogether like a gundam kit but with slightly inferior plastic nowadays the differences arent that big compared to how they used to be but bandais still got the better quality
  the carriers featured are landships most of the show until they go to space
  has there ever been an anime or manga about a youth who discovers a powerful boat and uses it to fight against the boats of an oppressive regime in order to secure peace and freedom for his people  arpeggio of blue steel
  can it paddle or not thats the important question
  out of the box no
  i know its very different but that thing reminds me a lot of rotf depthcharges battle mode we need more boatformers
lol it has no bottom itll sink
  boatformers find safe anchor in bayformers during storms
  i like how its bust looks kinda like a bridge
  not exactly the one you wanted but its the one we have    
  sweet another graze variant
  would be infinity better if the turrets has two or three barrels
  thats dlc in typical koto fashion
  you dont have to yell michael im all around you
  i just hope theres a canal this week
  isnt that submarines again
  plenty of boat action
  patented exclusive pla tech
  why do turrets need 2 barrels but tank only needs 1
  his mech doesnt turn into a literal battleship
  weight issue lighter boats have singleturret cannons too
  but tank only needs 1    multibarrel are what tank destroyers are for     
  looks more like a destroyer to me
  thats actually pretty lame would a little bit more kibble really have been that big a deal
  his battleship isnt a giant robot
    also why does the phalanx fold away in shipmode makes no sense he shouts at a robot that turns into a roboat
if it was bandai id kitbash it with a guntank and call it gunboat
  different use cases    tanks are nominally directfire weapons platforms and very tightly optimized ones they engage at ranges from nearly point blank to single digit kilometers older tanks were intended to stop and fire to get accurate shots newer tanks have effective gun stabilization    large heavy gun ships were mostly indirect fire platforms like artillery unlike other artillery they have the sea constantly fucking with their aim they have long had some sort of stabilization but ultimately they needed fire rate to compensate for inaccuracy unlike land artillery where its generally more cost effective to build a second entire gun carriage and have two artillery pieces than it is to have a double barreled artillery piece if youre building a giant fucking battleship you might as well have two three or sometimes even four guns per mount now that more advanced gun stabilization technology is around modern naval turrets almost exclusively have one cannon    also land vehicles and ships are very different targets tanks ifvs apcs etc are fairly tightly packed and tend to be arranged as a single fighting compartment where all the dudes and most of the nonautomotive equipment are possibly with a smaller second one for the driver and then a compartment for the engine/transmission a penetrating hit to either compartment will tend to fuck up something important to the point of missionkilling the vehicle    a large ship necessarily contains a lot of empty space not necessarily unused but losing a chunk of the crews bunks during pitched fighting isnt going to take the ship out of the fight in order to float on water a ships density is limited to less than 1metric ton per cubic meter of volume in order to cripple or destroy a ship therefore hits must not only penetrate the armor but also damage something important ships can soak up a lot more hits than land vehicles
  tanks are weightconstrained to about 75 tons tops and size constrained to fit on train cars but ships can be several tens of thousands of tons and pretty much just need to fit through the panama canal     tanks need an accurate gun that will penetrate as much armor as possible given the weight and size constraints one gun and as much armor as possible is universally considered a better compromise than two guns and sacrificing as much mass in armor to fit a second gun and loader/autoloader fire rate is less important to tanks because they usually only need to land one hit sensors communication gear and fire control systems are much more important because it tends to be that whoever fires first wins a fight between tanks    battleships and cruisers could often take considerable damage and continue functioning as long as the engines are still running and the magazine doesnt cook off a good damage control team can probably keep the thing afloat and shooting with whatever turrets havent been blown off yet so they want as many heavy cannons as possible to maximize fire rate and the cost of the extra weight and space is relatively small to a big ship    keep in mind a battleship is something like 750 times heavier than a modern tank and something like 2000 times bigger
  plastic injection molding peaked like 40 years ago its mostly been about controlling prices in bandais case the thing that lets them do is in house manufacturing 3rd party chinese manufacturing firms been getting increasingly expensive which is why prices on toys and waifu figs have been going up since they do manufacturing and assembly in china
  eh if you wanted to make really interesting parts you can make use of modern computergenerated 3d toolpaths to cut negative molds from graphite and then use that to edm the final mold into shape    gunpla just happens to make use of a lot of flat surfaces and hard angles and so benefits relatively little from more advanced machining technology
  riptide and good nautica toy never ever
what mecha could he transform into
    pilder on
the virgin red rocket ship  the chad blue big jet
  the pat pat rocket is no virgin you dont fuck with the pat pat rocket
  a red cosmos with a bigger beer gut
you think the other toho monsters like mothra and rodan will get their own solo movies after godzilla fights kong    does anyone even know what the plans are after that  it would have been cool to get some solo mothra and rodan film in between godzilla 2014 and skull island instead of warcraft and pacific rim
ghidorah literally has an autistic screech
  prove its autism and not you complaining
its actually autistic telephone noises
his roar is supposed to sound like bells and chimes
  ghidorah is cute cute
reeeeeedorah
  ghidoreeeeee
  an  its three autistic screeches bucko    he also has rodans sneezeyawn sometimes
  ghidorah even has the schoolgirl laugh
  ghiidoooraaaaaaaaaahh
  oh boi leave ghidorah to me
  destotroyaaaaaaaaaaahh
rude
  buster
  its all downhill from here fellasbut lets keep going anyway
  how is this possible
  king fedorah
no zeeks or feds
goggle suits were so damn kino they need to make a comeback
  a fucking crime this doesnt have a currentissue kit
  no zeeks or feds    this is what happens when you dont bait the /pol/tards of /m/ into posting in your thread
reeeeee fuck off jewpiter
  get out
  jin roh
  why does it look badass here but awful in every other media
they let him play with one eye
  barely any art of him which sucks
  i know
all she needed was dick
didnt they accept oldsmobile survivors to be part of their armed forces
  yes exzeeks and feds
    i always find this picture slightly weird because iron mask and meitzer ronah are the only two known characters and the others presumably meitzers kids are all novel only or something
  what are you talking about dude none of them are meitzers kids and theyre all in the movie    from right to left its annamarie zabine dorel and masks lieutenant or whatever who gets shot in the face by zabine near the end
  i guess most people dont remember annamarie because she was in the movie for a whole 5 minutes and she even switches sides without you seeing it
i miss that epic space anime feel i first had watching tominos uc gundam or lotgh you know politics worldbuilding war anyone can die large scope  anyone know any other series with this feel

my autism has reached its peak ive made notes of an edit im planning to do for gx to remove everything not relevant to the plot of axz fill plotholes and fix pacing when im finished it should be in easily movie format keeping most of the good bits and surgically removing all of the bad behold    
  sounds retarded
  i admire your dedication to removing all traces of topdad
  but see heres the real question    who cares
  this is insanely autistic but also a valiant effort because gx is just that fucking bad good luck on this anon it sounds like youve got mostly good changes in mind
  this is good can you remove the alchemy too
  and fix pacing  how the fuck are you going to fix the pacing of the final fight against carol
  /sgg/  remove alchemy
so when it comes to good character design they say that you should be able to tell a lot about the character just from the silhouette or something like thatwhat does this silhouette tell you
  the fuck are those spikes on hibikis hands fingers
  oh its her butt jets
  theyre on her bikki butt not her fingers
  that shes best girl
  she has a scarf and is therefore a hotblooded hero
  hibiki is spiky and has a cool scarf
  you should be able to tell a lot about the character just from the silhouette or something like that  its just that you should be able to know who it is just from the silhouette
    shirabe and her step dad get along so well it really tugs at the ol heart strings
so the new alchemist cards are all reds blue unison jii blue antialchemist xdrive jii and blue maid jii will absolutely reck them unfortunately    though im glad they exist im still a bit annoyed a new set came out so soon actually no im more annoyed at the games lack of feature to farm decent number of stones to roll gachas     i wont have the money to get them to a decent level like i usually do i was barely able to keep up with the release dates between the 6 previous cards but now there are 3 more and all very close to each other     the best i can hope for is to get at least 1 of each and that the the golden tickets include them from now on in the future though at one at at time thatll take a long time i might as well just wait many months for those gachas that let you get 6 of them in 10 rolls worth    i hope they get a new song and we eventually get bikini alchemists
  this is chrischan levels of autism
  implying you waste money on this crap
  how else are they going to pay for next seasons animation scraping coins from the bottom of fountains
  i only got 1 copies from 110 rolls
  i got 1 copy from using 3 gacha tickets i got from the cc for the first time since ive started playing i actually got a 5 from a gacha ticket im glad it was sanjeruman that being said i only have the 1 level 50 red sanjeruman    i only have 1 gacha ticket left from the cc so ill have to use gems for the other two alchemists    ill aim to get at least 1 of each id like more copies but who knows
what do you have to do in the 200 gems mission
  i think its just kill 5 noise or something i got it by accident when i was first testing out the new sanjeruman in a random quest mission
    this based mission got me a duo shout
    retard rocket
  still broken as fuck like the other unison cards to the point where a lv 52 duo can win against a lv 70 nonunison
geez you should run wowowow in literally every multi battle/boss quest this bleed effect on crit is retarded it pretty much doubles the damage of your units
look at this retard look at this completely retarded little bricks for brains look at this mentally challenged little dope look at what happens when you eat crayons for breakfast lunch and dinner
miku is an offical gear user now in xdu timeline  new events are now offically set post axz going of the blog announcement  new alchemist song    im actually pretty hyped  did the axz adaption in this game even acknowledge the event timeline though i didnt read through it
  also carol on suicide watch
i want to buy the shirabe dakimakura but something about it feels wrong to do so i think ill wait until they put out the kirika dakimakura too and just put them into bed together
    dont lewd shirabe
  its not lewd nobody could possibly have lewd thoughts about pure innocent shirabe
  that chris looks a bit young
  thats because its elfnein not chris
  pair the spares has gone too far
  nuclear_geahsjpg  chris has always been left out only way she wouldnt be is if fine somehow came back but kirika made sure that wont happen
  until elfneins sisterwife gets back shell have to make do with her surrogate mommy
  i was about to say thats a lot of incest vibes to be piling on elf9 for no reason but then i remembered she carried her daddy issues for centuries
  nuclear_geahsjpg    on it
  kanade is passionate
which saint is best saint straight hair ponytail or twin tails
  germain is a precure at this point
  that mikuchick is scaring me
  it should
  i really like the alchemists casual clothes so im going to go with straight hair saint plus her hair just looks straight ridiculous as she evolves into her final form
i miss the hibitchki spammer
  some one has to keep it straight
    translation
  maria mentions to tsubasa that shes got a penthouse room in the hotel and they should go there after dinner for various activities    like mario kart which is truly the best
  thanks
  this artist hasnt done anything new in ages
  that is a good tummy
  maria and tsubasa look great in fancy outfits i wish they got to wear something like that in the anime
  whats this story about
  ive only seen a brief summary so far but what i read is that it takes place in the kanade universe and it turns out her maybeevilmaybenot ryoko is evil and teams up with adam kanade tries to fight them alone but karma noise show up and overpower her so the main universe girls have to go help out with their new postaxz rebuild gears or whatever
  ryoko is evil and teams up with adam  this is the biggest bullshit ive ever read fine and adam were enemies
  ryouko might not have been fine in that universe though still bullshit as teaming up with adam is a retarded idea
its okay carol let them laugh because soon youre going to get revived in xv then youll be laughing when that episode airs youre going to be put in xdu and youre going to be meta then youre going to get youre own super form which is going to be even more meta the day of the all carol meta is soon
  i hope she enjoys her time in the spotlight before sunshine god miku powercreeps her out of it
  even worse i cant imagine the real ryouko being evil
  the real ryouko was just a perverted woman who could have easily been infected by the mimetic nature of violence and evil that was a big theme of s1
  which will be a week tops ive never seen any other game embrace power creep so aggressively
  what
  ive never seen any other game embrace power creep so aggressively  you must have not played many gacha games   for most of them its less a power creep and more power sprint
  the power creep in xdu isnt even that bad hell one of the best cards in the game is still one the second xd card they released shirabe
  its one of chriss main themes in that season and its something that fine kept harping on
finally time to watch au sanjerumans adventures
better quality i hope cag comes out tomorrow or the next day
damn these season 5 gears look good
nice to see kanade just attacking instead of talking to try to fix everything like bikki would
  theyre two different characters it would be stupid to expect them to have the same approach to dealing with villians
  damn thats an enormous bow    a bow  a wing
  oh i know im saying i prefer whenever au kanade is the protagonist      the power of best kanade outfit      in any case kanade fought them 3vs1 and lost though none of the other gears in the main story would have dared to try that they all had to use ignite and 2vs1 them so props to the power of sun kanade
germains hair has become too powerful
  considering the origin of that noodle nickname was actually wrong its a pretty huge coincidence that the tokens for this mission seem to be ramen bowls
  purerāti wanted ramen so ramen we got
kanade gets to be involved in another major story showing her worlds progression   in edgebikki and serenaland
  im surprised they didnt make all of those just one other world it seems like it would have been fine to do it that way
so whats the plot au alchemists and kanade against  
special power has a gun
shes crying again i just asked her to make some toast and now shes crying
  shes been through some turbulent times cut her some slack
  why is this image so funny
  shes just having ptsd flashbacks again just ignore her for a while or express youre disappointment in the lack of toast
      she had one job it was toast now that she screwed up she needs to be punished and that means a good hard slap to the tits
give monster germain bigger breasts please pokelabo
brisingamen continues to be even more useless than the literallyuseless ignite forms  literally isnt even a bonus unit  i love the looks of sunflame but the way they handled it in the stories is pantsonheadtier
  kanade gets to be involved in another major story showing her worlds progression  but its just another dogshit boring story its an insult to kanade
  because even when she is berserk she still has the presence of mind to know that guns work really well without having to get close
so does the new event mean that theyre actually going to keep these for xv
  if the xdu writers have any knowledge of the actual shows production then probably i cant imagine that the characters looks wouldnt be set in stone at this point but then i dont know much about how anime is produced
  the only problem is that xdu and the main show diverged after gx because of the gjallahorn the alchemists hadnt shown up there while they went on wacky au adventures unless theyre trying to imply that it did happen now in xdu without reference to any of the passed xdu events taking place because axz missions are now there
  if the axz rebuilds are in kanades new event i guess youll just have to assume that that is the case and just ignore all the issues this creates
    just think of the xdu events like the dbz movies
  why do they keep kicking me in the dess dess
  so does she have twin scythes i hope she calls them dess and troy
i want serena milk
  youd have to impregnate her first shes not maria
  imagine how well marias hips and breasts would turn out if you put kids in her
    yes imagine
  its a shame there isnt more pregnant sword
  take the manly girl and fertile cow couple  impregnate manly girl  what the fuck
  tsubasa is not manly she is just handsome but she can also be sexy cute and beautiful
what you want the poor kid to stave
    yeah but theres still the issue of maria successfully impregnating anyone
  maria always succeeds when she tries her best she just needs to eat some catering food      go to hell
    maria has never succeeded
  shes succeeded at a few things
  she won the genetic lottery sync rate doesnt even matter anymore
    tits made for slapping
  such as
  shes pretty successful as a power distributor for xdrive an what not she managed to keep her idol career and even gain a new one as a un secret agent despite publicly declaring herself as a terrorist shes even gotten pretty good a picking up hibikis wife saving slack aside from a single misstep at the start
  tfw drunk hibiki fondles maria
  it would be like ver all over again
  hibikis going to help maria continue the human race
  that dikki isnt going to suck itself
  she cant produce a new race of pure humans with just mikus help after all
  hibikigoku tsubasapiccolo chrisvegeta but when is symphogear going to get its own version of the best villain broly i mean if you really want to reach out there you could suggest carol  once in full power just overpowers everybody  has to be beat by everyone sending their power to the main characters fist for one final attack  really angry and stupid sure carol lost her dad but instead of taking revenge as soon as she learned some alchemy or in 10 or 20 years she dicked around for hundreds of years and now wants to kill the whole world  but carols just really fucking stupid i just want a simple villain who the show wont try to make me feel sorry for
  i just want a simple villain who the show wont try to make me feel sorry for  custodians i guess nice straightforward evil ancient aliens
  the show is always going to have at least one villian that they want you to feel sorry for regardless of how poorly they actually handle their sympathetic traits at best youll characters like the autoscorers who arent real people or the male villains who either dont have sympathetic backstories that we know of like ver or have whatever sympathy their backstory might evoke ignored like with adam
  i just want a simple villain who the show wont try to make me feel sorry for    fudo
  you already got fine she was a bitch
  but fine was right shoot the moon remove ayy
    stay away from them
  why is the alien queen piloting the power lifter
  in terms of power carol has been the closest thing thus far  ver has been the only villain without a tragic backstory unless you want to count minor villains like trump and fudo    its possible the custodians will more closely fit the bill  if not i really doubt god will have any backstory at all tragic or no
  shes a clever girl
    no she really really isnt
  i was doing a jurassic park thing
  maria almost lost her nipples
lv 70 wowowow can beat multi battle loli carol in one run thats pretty neat  actually i think she can beat almost every multi battle boss like this
i havent watched anything in this series past g  should i marathon the next few seasons or should i just wait until the last season
  just watch it its a lot of fun as you should already know
  be warned gx is a mess but axz is good
  somethings out of place here
  gx is garbage axz is excellent but if you are willing to wait you should probably wait axz ends on a cliffhanger for the next season
  its not a big cliffhanger
  g starts off good but decreases in quality every episode axz is much better
yoooooooooooo
  unless luck resets at the end of the year enjoy rolling shit for months to come
  fuck you
  hey did anyone else not get the daily or weekly gem missions right now
  there was an announcement saying there wont be dailies or weeklies this week they gave us 50 gems for it my japanese isnt good enough to say what theyre doing but my assumption is theyre revamping the system in some manner      5 5s and a 4  youre never gonna get another 5 aside from the guarantee pulls but what a roll to go out on
  g starts off good but decreases in quality every episode  nope thats axz
  nope thats axz    no thats gx
  50 gems is actually fine by me considering 731536 so we are getting more than usual and dont have to play xdu as much
  everyone knows gx is the worst season but that anon was arguing axz is better than g which is incorrect
  i suspect he meant to type gx and missed the x
  yeah i meant gx the first two episodes were pretty good but it was just plain bad by the last two
    no i meant axz the first episode is great the 2 next episodes are decent then it gets bad the tomato adventure was terrible  then we get episode 6 which wastes a great song axia no kaze on a shitty boring scene we the illuminati want to deactivate the lunar ruins   the chris/maria and tsubasa/shirabe episodes were pretty similar the monster hibiki was a huge dissapointment and defeated in 2 minutes episode 12 was so terrible it killed all hype left and made me lose all hope the ending was just everyone throws their power at hibiki again
im not in top shape  takes 10 seconds to corner chris and could have cut her throat
  its not like chris is any sort of shape
  its definetly axz that was the only one where i had to force myself to continue watching because of how boring it was
  mobility has never been chris thing girl spends most fights sitting on her fat ass while shooting away
  of course mobility isnt her thing she wears six inch platform shoes into combat they even go click clack clack when she runs and it makes the peepee the big peepee
  to be fair shes usually fielded in very target rich fights all she has to do is slightly pivot around and mow down noise not that many reasons to move around
  she also probably has the most heavy weaponry out of all of them beside the big basa sword  which usually nobody carries around
  i dont think that really matters they all have superstrength when in geah form
  chris  kande  gungnir maria  kirika  tsubasa  shirabe  airgetlam maria  hibiki  serena    although their weapons change especially chriss so heaven knows thats just a rough ranking
  whats the point of physical training then
  maybe their base attributes are multiplied when in geah a la shehulk
  the training is explicitly for the psychological aspect more than the physical one
  id put airgetlam maria tied with chris since they both just choose how much they have  chris usually runs around with her dual pistols or dual crossbows like maria has her daggers or whip but maria can also run around with her arm cannon like chris has her dual heavy machineguns
  so theyll fit inside the gears theyre one size only and chris is pushing it constantly
  it doesnt matter the reasonthey would still have to gain some muscle just through the effort try exercising for your own mental benefit theres still going to be a physical difference from before you started because youre still putting your body through a workout
  what and maria isnt the true miracle in gx was that she still fit into her old gungnir
  sure but that wasnt what i was addressing
  the true miracle in gx was that she still fit into her old gungnir  where do you think the cape went  gungnir had to remodel in order to compensate so the materials were used to expand the whole thing
  lucky i did well on sanjeruman so in exchange i got only the one guaranteed pull for purerāti out of 10 im bummed out i hope there are banners in the future with those cards though ill be annoyed if they are the last pull in those banners
    chris is fatter
  shirabe  airgetlam maria  shirabes metal twintails look heavy and she has to carry them in her head it looks pretty uncomfortable
  maria stop posting nobody believes your lies
  assuming the gears amplify their base strength then increasing their base strength would make a lot of sense
 hikasa voicing not one not two but three singers in the most recent episode of merc storia though one of them didnt actually sing  and only one of them sounded like maria ladys got range
  some vas have crazy range    like swashiro she voices 4 distinct character in fgo        
  you can still hear that sawashiro raspiness for lack of a better word in all of them though
30 200 gem rolls and no 6 cards thats bs you should be guaranteed 6 cards after that many rolls regardless of where your luck is currently at or what you previously rolled in other banners
  i respectfully disagree
since they keep coming up with these useless new features like the drills i wonder how long itll be until they come up with a trading system     trade in shitty cards at different values towards a medal system that when enough are gathered you can get 1 of whatever card they have in the store older cards cost fewer medals and newer cards cost more    also they better have a gold ticket for sale again in the 2nd half of the month
  gold ticket with the unisons and nonevent alchemists added
anyone have like a high res version of biker maria posing without the background
  they better add the event alchemists as well especially if they add the all almighty and powerful unisons at the very least give 1 event card to use in the 2nd half of the month    at the very least i want the event flat alchemist since she protects against skill seal so that red jii stops harassing me while i deal with ctf
  the only render that ive seen are the ones that show up in the home screen but those are generally cropped a bit to fit from the original
  tfw phantom thief maria only got like ten pieces of fanart  biker maria got a fraction of that  such good designs wasted i hope biker at least gets a cameo as what she wears when she rides bikes with tsubasa as a regular outfit
  they will never be that generous right now they have that shitty emblem system where it takes ten x10 rolls to buy one 5 worse still there are different colors and they expire so each of the color badges are only good for one banner hell a while ago they had two red badges one slightly darker than the other    if you didnt get the card you wanted the devs only have one answer for you whale harder faggot
  fuck the devs and management i dont whale past 30 rolls when the guaranteed drops expire
    what made saint germain go berserk
  she got absorbed by a new kind of karma noise that has some ignitelike patterns on its face
  someone called her daughter of a whore
  the bread spoiled
sanjeruman i love you
    people still want chris put back with her abuser
i can farm deadly pilar next weekend right
  unless they change the schedule then no different cards come out next time
i still havent gotten the daily nor weekly missions
  theyve taken them out this week because theyre revamping the system
  see 
  its not rape when blumenkranzmp3 plays in the background
  well i guess i can be fine that i got up to lv56
this outfit was really good i miss it
  maria please you can ask your girlfriend to wear latex whenever you want
i made a webm for you circle jerkers
  removing the big bad shaggy isnt going to magically make gxs writing good
  do it itll be hilarious
to improve gx you must remove alchemy and replace carol/dolls for better villains in a world where a bunch of relics exist why did we even need alchemy in the first place
  of course it wont but the symphogear version of its the bee movie but without bees is probably gonna be worth a chuckle
  because fine mentioned alchemy once so obviously we needed to gain more insight into it via a murderous retard with daddy issues
    the idea of alchemy as an opposing force to the gears is good but the initial implementation was bad axz shored up the concept a bit with germain and co that i think would have done a decent job of replacing carol and her dolls if kaneko learned to spread main plot lines and villains across multiple seasons instead of just a few small setups
  i like carols design and voice she even has a great song shame all that was wasted on gx
have 200 gems again  tempted to roll for new saint germain  but i want to save my gems and my virginity for kyaroru
  by the time shes out youll probably guarantee a 6 if you save until then
azoth gears are in the current event was there anything about a possible release in the latest update
    axz just sort of sits around the same level of meh
  yeah i got my serena to level 58    granted we cant reasonably use these in the arena but they can still help out in the multibattles and regular quests      sexjeruman is great but like all alchemists you really want them all together to make it worth it though if just to look at then shes great there as well    if you get kyarou make sure you get loli kyarou
which frog is the most psychopathic
  the only thing i liked about alchemy is the implication that they were kept in line by fine its interesting that they defeated fine to save the world but that triggered other enemies to appear
i wonder if the geahs ever had to reeducate chris on what a normal nonfiné christmas looks like  shed catch a cold after all
  its fine she knows she should do it at home
  there exists at least one alternate universe where a chrisless fine saw a chris come over from another world and kept her as an unwilling pet
  unwilling
  shell be relapsed and not want to go back but shes dragged kicking and screaming to fines rape nest until her friends think oh she must have gone home and accidentally abandon her forever
commie or horrible for s1 and gx
  ehhh having a pink sortahealer wouldve been good for my level 58 wowowow especially considering deadly pilar deals special damage i can make due with 15 hp per turn better than i could 10 at the very least though 20 wouldve been welcome
anyone else have this scale is she worth 200
  god i hope azenbu comes out for chrismas
  it was the first scale i ever bought ive given up on this series getting easily available posable figures besides the s1 figmas and its great the chris that came out a few months back is cool too although the stands for the miniguns are kinda cheap tsubasa when
  the fact that youre asking that instead of already having it in transit or in your house means its probably not worth it
  its a very nice scale with good build quality bit on the expensive side for what it is but its for a series that seems to have a high amount of difficulty in getting any figures whatsoever probably the best thing were ever going to get      lots of scales cost plenty of cash but arent worth the money due to lack of quality or production errors that arent apparent from promotional pictures and sometimes even photos others take its a valid question
why is tsubasa so perfect
  that custom build burning i kinda want
  eugenics
the first draft is done all the clips have carefully selected spliced and placed some scenes connect to each other better than they did in the series while other cuts are really noticeable im probably going to mess with the audio in audacity just to clean it up i mean its watchable right now but really amateurish at the very least i need to learn to typeset so fix the dialogue and continuity errors that arise from cutting scenes
  hairbun tsubasa  nice
  i love how this artist makes chris so short
i wonder how much it costs per gallon
    the dont make chris short they make tsubasa super tall
i wonder if this is the games way of trying to make it up to me after screwing me over in the prelati gacha
  are there official heights for tsubasa and chris
  167cm and 153cm
  sword  167cm  zenbu  153cm
    i see thanks so its for sure not this  huge of a difference
  that sword has too much leg for anyone other than bayonetta
    tsubasa is all kinds of leggy
so are relics gender locked for women only
  only compatible women can activate relics but anyone can use a complete relic once its been activated but as far as i can recall the fragments in the symphogear pendants need to be sung to continuously in order stay active which is why only relic compatible women can wear the symphogears
  what if i was born a dude but identify as a chick
  then you need to get a hold of the perfect alchemy body
  i must assume that the relics only care about a persons biological sex and that someone born male would need to have their sex changed in the same way as cagliostro and prelati in order to activate a relic
  its fucking amazing
  define relic
  define gear because injecting yourself with liquid evil is not the same thing
  do you think thats why the pendants are red
  tsubasa is rubbing her breast against chris arm
  logh is aesthetic as fuck
votoms specially the woodo arc it has that punk setting but in a lowtech kind of environment not in the scifi way there is scifi stuff but its pretty tame compared to other stuff around the same time  i think the first sunny place you see in the whole series is that planet during shining heresy
probably one of the best things in the original logh aesthetically speaking is how they choose well the architecture to represent each side characteristics the empire have a mix of rococo with neoclassical with a bit of edwardian era stuff while the fpa have modernist public buildings around modern urban settings    dnt in its turn partially lost the meaning of the empire architecture aesthetics instead choosing for a mix of medieval and victorian neogothic which is a bit off the mark considering that the novel kinda emulates elements of the frederician and napoleonic eras but in compensation the interior of buildings and ships in dnt are very beautiful
city hunter
i absolutely love the everything looks like melted poop aesthetic of new cutie honey
would gundam x be in line with the frost brothers aesthetics
  quent is pretty sunny
turn a  the difference between the earth races ww1 era architecture and design compared to the utter alien look of the moonrace  a long with some classic looking suits from various timelines mixed it  it being the last hand painted cel gundam series is pretty nice too    the turn as design is a nice change compared to all the other gundams is nice too love it or hate it it stands out from the rest of them while still having what it takes to be a gundam
  jesus i wrote this like im mentally ill sorry lads
  this  theres just insane amount of thought put into these designs
  so is kummen
  nothing to apologize about you were right and expressed yourself coherently and concisely    i want to suggest g reco and giant gorg dragons heaven is super aesthetic but a oneoff rather than a show
  dragons heaven was great its look and general things around the setting made me want to know more about the world and the history of it thouigh that wasnt the point of the ova
  macross 7s setting isnt too crazy or unique insofar as futuristic scifi goes but i just love the color palette used for city 7s night time scenes
  the giant robo ovas retrofuture aesthetic has always been one of my favorites
  iczer 1 for me
  zeorymer as well
  youre fine man     totally agree too turna if nothing else was a complete visual treat excellent soundtrack too
tenjin hidetaka thread    the best artist /m/ ever had

previous thread   how to get into kr and where to start      list of subbed series      direct download links   embed    kamen rider monster compilation      zio meets chad and some random pink dude tomorrow     kamen rider crossz vcinema trailer     rider zio and build heisei generations forever  
hongo knows who the real chad of kamen rider is
in this ever expanding universe can you feel  unironically what did they mean by mean by this
is a stated limit ever given on the ryuki riders cards like can they only use them once per transformation or something
  the parent trap has finally been topped
  imagine tsukuyomi being splitroasted by you and you
  no they can actually afford to spam them as far as i know please correct me if the official site states otherwise for some reason they dont do that though maybe final vents need a recharge or cooldown period though i think you can spam advent as long as your monsters under your control
  why do they need her when they have each other
  my own clone now neither of us will be virgins
how will another kuuga be btfo
post tsukuyomi
  putotyra time mazijin
  remember when ankh looked at himself and the line separating was visible
  the line separating  
  i forget which episode shingo and ankh were across eachother
  masahiro it wasnt that odd since decades been played by other guys already prior to this so yeah when i first saw takaiwa again i was like you sure bulked up huh laugh  masahiro is too good for this world he seems like such a fun guy
did they repainted the exaid armor into gemn armor is that why its only used once
  nah the exaid armor is coming back soon
  gai has two copies of confine vent but that more means that he can use it on two riders at once presumably a card is recycled back to the deck when its used
  exaid armor is back in december its anyones guess i feel like this early into the show they should have enough budget to not have to do that since its really just the shoulders theyd have to make again nothing else is really reusable or worth reusing/repainting but who knows with toei
  they probably repainted exaid into genm and then back into exaid again
  i loved the last part of that interview where masahiro said hes willing to do anything for his fans even come back for the entirety of zio tugged on my heartstrings i genuinely wouldnt mind him sharing the spotlight with sougo for the rest of the series his presence makes perfect sense narratively too plus no episode will be a bore with him there then again maybe its just me but having an actor this invested and passionate in the franchise makes me feel so much more invested myself too i love every second tsukasa is on screen and cant wait until ep 13 drops
q how much of kamen rider have you seen  masahiro well i havent seen anything after decade     i thought this guy was a huge kamen rider fan
  people are becoming more and more distant from each other so its harder to empathize with people    in other words misunderstandings
  kino  i  n  o
  at least he is sincere maybe he dont have the time
  watching kamen rider on broadcast  when hes been watching it all on set
q this time it seems that decade can transform into heisei phase 2 riders as well so what rider transformations do you personally want to see  masahiro well among them isnt there a guy who can turn invincible so i wanna see him kamenride into exaids muteki form then use decades illusion to create copies then use invisible to turn invisible and then use kabutos clock up laugh
  what a madman
  masahiros unlocked the secret combination to decades god mode just make sure violent emotion is on the table go muteki and make a couple of muteki clones go invisible and clock up hell tear the heisei universe a new asshole
  masahiros performance as jinga actually makes him come off as somewhat terrifying masahiro is effectively playing two characters one who is a generic protagonist and cant act and then the other is a sadistic asshole who is really good at acting and its throwing me off    because the possessed jinga is trying to act like normal jinga and doing a good job minus a few noticeable mannerisms here and there it feels like anybody who questions him trusts him too much or even gets too close to him could end up with a sword inside of them ive expected his two costars to have died by now given how uncomfortably close he gets to them
why the fuck isnt this the headline
  his presence makes perfect sense narratively too  hed be the kuuga to zios decade but not yuseless
it looks like decades suit actors even thinner than takaiwa was when he originally wore the suit whoever it is hope he does a good job
when will he go full ham inshow
  because its fake and theres no source for it
  i wouldnt want tsukasa in every episode but id be down with him showing up 34 times throughout the show to be a mentor figure who isnt always there when you might want him around but passes through to dispense advise or a kick in the ass when its needed
      its not even the lack of source but the low quality of the image how can people even say for sure that its takeru sato with his face all blurry like that
them all constantly cracking up  the fucking voices    i love the 5 episodes and it just dawned on me that with tsukasa being back for 9 episodes hes going to be in a few of them and that makes me feel absolutely ecstatic
  when he gets his rider powers and memories back
  tsukuyomi looks like she fuck like a dead fish
    so the whole hes woz from the future is false then    swartz is kamen rider woz
  swartz is superwoz
  the time jackers are most likely the riders woz stole his powers from
    swortz
  i kind of doubt that aside from sento and episode 1 and 2 had other oddities the riders kept their personality even when their history was erased it seems odd these three then would become evil
  not wanting to fuck her until she starts flopping like a fish out of water from cumming
  ohhhhhhhhhhhhh  who lives in time mazine above the sea  tsukuyomi
  his episodes show that they just built him a small hut to live in inside toei because they cant stop him from passing through all the time
geez dikeido how come you get nine slated episodes for zio
  im sure this applies to most of them they are just actors after all
find a merit on this form
  the thumbnail looks like some obari pose
  large capacity usb drives
  hell fall over easily im sick of riders who just wont fall over
  he knows the new riders by name at least  he probably will watch something again when his son is old enough to watch sunday morning shows
  whats the storage size of those 2 usb sticks
  a whole 11mb
blocks your path
  tvn already has it subbed  theyll probably take it down in a few months once amazon prime puts it up
  kamen rider  fuck  you
    this is the interview with masahiro by the way comfy
mfw decade kicks kamen rider wozs ass or woz teams up with him
  well he clearly at least enjoys being a toku actor i mean he was in a piece of garbage like zebraman 2 for fuck sake
decade shows up in the clock repair shop  everyones apprehensive  he casually approaches uncle  treats uncle like natsumis grandpa and gets him to do maintenance on his camera using smooth language and roundabout logic  a camera is a tool to immortalize history you could say that its a record of time itself no different from a clock thats why it makes perfect sense for a clock repair shop to do maintenance work on a camera right
  i thought rider 1s actor died years ago
  youre thinking riderman or stronger
  showing your face in ghost is worse than death
  youre mistaking him for kamen rider stronger who passed away 6 years ago    riderman passed away 1986 though
what did rabbitrabbit accomplish again
this is sougo say something nice about him
  being hayai
  has it already been six years
  but not as hayai as faiz axel kabuto accel trial ooo latorartar or drive
  it was still hayai who cares if it wasnt more hayai
  it wasnt hayai enough to win
what is so cool about this place
  masahiros favorite rider is shin    man with good taste
yo
  1st shin  2nd kabuto  3rd ryuki
  relatively few rider actors have died yet actually     rip kiba as always
  i wanna know if there was ever an explanation for that whole numbering thing on rouze cards    like i have to assume its part of some game they made for kids at the time using them but inshow they just have number values attached to them that blink on the sword or gun or whatever and im like why
  gotta have that sweet yugioh appeal
  thats good for 40 year old franchise really  still a shame some of these people died young
  being my favourite build suit next to hazard its so criminally wasted on jobbing
  its probably like the attack number on the ryuki cards according to the wiki the attack power is the ammount of tons of damage the attack does the attack damage to tons being of 5 maybe the numbers on rouze cards are just like that damage its technically a card game after all
    i really wish the rabbit ears on the back were cloth nice scarfy look
  tsukuyomi is crossz now she gets dragon waifus too
  someone post katsuragis transformation webm
i just realized that were probably not gonna get much more than the three forms for the decade armor nothing else seems to work with it from a practicality standpoint
    i think theres a chance we could see it mixed with other watches like how theyre distributing a build hazard watch for the movie it seems like mixing the decade armor chest with build hazard should be rather easy    even outside of that fangjoker tajador flame dragon and deadheat or formula also should work fine same goes to earlier forms like hibiki kurenai and blade jack its mostly fourze magnets connected chest/back and gaim kachidokis pipes from the skirt to the chest jinbas lack of new undersuit that would have issues
  a lot of suits arent actually designed to switch chestpieces it would actually be especially problematic with w and wizard due to how their suits are designed ooo is also a huge problem because you cant fit the chest emblem under the decade chespiece and if you get rid of it youll end up with circuit lines attached to nothing the larger the original forms chestpiece the more impractical it would be to use it with the decade armor
  additionally the decade armor doesnt seem to summon weapons since weapons are kind of the main point of fourze and gaim that presents another issue without his cannons magnet states is worthless
  waga maou is cute
  your dumb facial reactions to things how genuinely cheery you are and your ability to mess up finishers but still make them look cool are all great and i enjoy your show a lot
somebody needs to draw a picture of beast and pikachu in a restaurant chugging mayonnaise and ketchup respectively with an exasperated waiter portrayed by character of your preference asking them if theyd like some food with their condiments
holy shit that was fucking convulted  i hope they dont make time travel within time travel with doubles a regular thing
  zio decade armor is going to be fighting oma zio soon so thatll count as doubles as long as oma zio is actually sougo
akira from hibiki  still cute as fuck    
anyone have a peeking tsukuyomi
  i have this one and
    this one
    thanks a bunch
  tackles actress died when she was 27
  27 club
  kiba passed away three years ago  fuck i thought it happened more recently
  man if you thought that was convoluted then youre better off never watching the movie primer
  who wore it better
today is いい尻の日 nice butt day in japan
  
  asians are paags
  
  when letzte gets brought in to replace oma
tfw you keep your liking of kamen rider a secret because people like this are in the fandom  
  what did he mean by this
  kys
  is this a tokuotaku memes
  the demon king is getting replaced with the king of the time jackers
  thank god i dont care what other people thinks
  so whos this daisuke guy who always asks masahiro questions
  her asthma got her supposedly the actor of rider 2 was in a relationship with her and took it badly
  its likely what led to the binge drinking which in turn led to the housefire that scarred the fuck out of him i wont say for sure since im not finding exact dates on short notice but its pretty damn likely
the only time well ever see haruka and jim interact with the original amazon is in some shitty 3ds game that nobody bothered to translate the convos from  i hate the fandom
what would you do if there were toei shills itt right now
  the virgin micchy  the chad kouta
  id buy whatever they sell because its the smart thing to do
  ask when the fuck the new decadriver is being released
  thats me
  a mans life can really spiral into hell in the blink of an eye
    what
  well fuck i wanna be an ultra actor then apparently working on ultraman gives you the secret to immortality
  theyre immortal aliens after all
  he hasnt learned the required japanese to watch shows for kids
    too bad all the new ultra actors are uggos
  great i have a chance
    do gaijins have a chance at playing a character in some toku show its my dream
  only when you are working for some blacklisted agencies with connection with some powerful local organizations
  as stuntmen/mooks and extras maybe tom constantine got an in through becoming a stuntman and becoming buddies with koichi sakamoto and jun watanabe
  arent you afraid of going bald  if i were afraid of going bald i wouldnt be able to play jinga
  thane camus makes it look easy
  weve got an argentine in dairanger so its not impossible
  q in the last nine years what sort of life do you think tsukasa has lived in what worlds and what part of destroying do you think he likes best  masahiro when hes destroying i dont really know because i dont think hes ever enjoyed destroying right hes someone who lives in conflict with his role as a destroyer if anything im pretty sure he actively hates destruction doesnt he probably
    the actor of mirai / mebius is a bloated drunk today
  i think this is an interesting contrast between decade and zio when decade calls himself a destroyer theres usually a sense of irony selfderision or resignation to it he doesnt want to destroy but since thats his role and a necessary one at that he has no choice but to accept it whereas sougo is completely straightforward when he says im gonna be a good demon king d
  this guy great uncle is fucking albert camus so no wonder he got some recognition
  q what do you think of narutaki  m a weird old man
  i do wonder if anything will happen to break sougo and make him more serious/introspective or if hes gonna keep on being a happy go lucky aspiring demon lord
  his baggy raccoon eyes were really distracting in mebius desu
  at least it was a women and not a fat neck beard
  hell get back in shape for his comeback right /m/
  ya know that image really fucks with me why the fuck did he hate kouta so much at first but instantly liked the most selfish rider there is
  the most selfish rider there is  thats not haruto tho
  the most selfish rider there is  are you actually retarded
  ghosts cant eat din    oh right i forgot about mr sacrifice the entire city for my emotionless doll
  the way i see it hes going to actually become the demon lord zio he seems to be heading down that path where tsukasa hates his role as destroyer sogou seems to be so intent on becoming a demon king hes probably going to forget about the good part or hes going to be like what im doing is good you just want to get in the way of my goodness
  im actually tempted to say tendous more selfish than haruto haruto at least usually cares about killing the phantoms to protect the gates its only in the last arc where he gets obsessed with keeping koyomi alive and turns into an asshole tendou literally only fought the worms and natives so that hiyori would be left alone the fact that he saved the world by doing that was completely incidental
  using ghosts cant eat dinner as an excuse for selfishness  the entire point of that line was argos asking him why takeru wanted to be alive and not be an immortal ghost  its a simple pleasure and theres a lot about how stupid it is given hes given many other much better answers in the show but its not an act of selfishness given he understands why he wants to be alive again and still gave it up the first chance he got back when he saved kanon
  tendou is top of selfish  tsukasa would probably be second if you dont count almost every other rider minus gattack from kabuto  haruto would come afterwards
  youre skipping over the part where he says fuck you to his city that was destroyed in his battle all for his physical body that he doesnt even fucking need
  argos was literally the one destroying it because it was just a place to cultivate eyecons did you fucking forget how argos turned into extremer
  oh right i forgot about mr sacrifice the entire city for my emotionless doll  what when did that happen
  hes exaggerating but the last act of wizard has haruto willingly go along with wisemans plan to do a ritual to bring koyomi back to life while he thinks that its just going to sacrifice him and the three other wizards he turns against it when he learns itll also kill everyone in the city but killing yourself and three other people including a father of a newborn and a tenyearold kid for your zombie waifu is still a total dick move    im pretty sure in the original draft it was supposed to be just haruto sacrificing himself by using the drago timer to be in four places at once which would have been more reasonable the change was probably because they had a bunch of mage suits from the movie and wanted to use them so they introduced the three other wizards
  its his fucking fight what the fuck did the city have to do with the eyecons did everyone in the city go yeah fuck it dude we love you ghost do whatever it takes and have your final battle here no they fucking didnt and when takeru was presented with the chance to fix the fucking city what does he do nah theyll fix it on their own haha i want my body
  anon by this logic every fucking kamen rider is selfish because none of them ever help out with repairing the cities that were destroyed in their fights
what in tarnation is puzzle  dragon    
  i have a hard time believing a toy commercial for kids will end with the protagonist actually becoming evil and staying that way
  none of them had the chance to reverse all the damage done then instead choose to help themselves with something that they literally did not need
  im pretty bummed that w as my favorite heisei rider has such a disappointing armor its literally just giant gaia memories and a different chest piece i feel like they couldve made the memories smaller and given him some shin and forearm alterations
  its a match 3 game
  now youre really reaching anon every single one has had opportunities to fix their cities through multiple means and they dont nothing that takeru did in that fight is inherently more selfish than any other rider character
    youre mixing up the movie and the end of the show which can be easy given the shows final boss is just an extremer repaint    at the end of the show the reason takeru only asks the great eye to turn him human again and not to undo all the damage caused by the ganmeizers was to show they wouldnt repeat the ganma civilizations mistake where they found a magic genie and used its power for everything to the point where if anything happened to the great eye they would start disintegrating because theyd abandoned their physical bodies for ones built on its power    would asking the great eye to fix the city have been fine yeah probably but its just property damage things can be rebuilt and replaced its not an asshole move to decide that not everything has to be handled with magic wishes
  which one was told they had a wish they wanted granted while being offered examples including specifically fixing the city im not reaching and i understand they were trying to send a message to the effect of people always get back up and start again or some shit but it comes off so poorly when you realize he blew off the city for a shiney new flesh suit that he didnt need because he was already an immortal semiphysical being
  which one was told they had a wish they wanted granted while being offered examples including specifically fixing the city  ryuki ren straight up just asks for his girlfriend back
  tendou  selfish  tendou spends the first half of the series stalking kagami to make sure he didnt die he even comes up with a plan to make kagami regain his confidence on like 2 occasions tendou pretends to be selfish
  staying that way no probably not but he might do it for 12 episodes where the focus shifts to geiz woz will be murdered by demon king zio but that will be undone too and geiz convinces zio to come to his senses and stop this shit
  no they didnt how would kuuga have fixed anything every single power he has is geared towards killing things    incidentally deno does nothing but fix his city decade literally fixed everything at the expense of his own life and then was conveniently brought back because hes some sort of bizarre extradimensional alien who can do weird shit
  tendou was im going to kill every single worm except my sister he was unapologetically hypocritical in his goals
  but it comes off so poorly when you realize he blew off the city for a shiney new flesh suit that he didnt need because he was already an immortal semiphysical being  you mean the people who were kill by the ganmaizer from both worlds he got a new shiny flesh suit as a gift
  for starters how many rider series these past 50 years even involve any manner of widespread city destruction huge loss of human life sure but dont know many riders who can resurrect huge numbers of randoms it sounds more like youre thinking of ultraman where the whole swathes of a city are in ruins at the end of every episode but the big friendly giant doesnt help clean it up
owo
    tendou is selfish in that the only people who matter are those he cares about literally nobody else matters and hell say and do whatever it takes to make them happy kagami included look at god speed love where its still just him his sister and kagami together he has literally noone else
  i may be remembering this incorrectly but as i recall the bonus gift was either the city being repaired or his body
          why didnt hongo takeshi use his stupendously high iq to create scientific wonders and turn the whole world into a utopia 50 years ago and prevent an endless number of other heroes like him from having to be born
  if youre counting nonmain riders basically all of the ryuki riders are completely self serving
  takeru asks for the great eye to revive the people who were killed by the ganmeizers it assumes at first that he wants it to also repair the damage to the city but he declines for the reasons outlined in  the great eye turns him back human as a bonus gift then fucks off
  he has a hardon for justice and revenge
  too busy fighting gangsters in third world shitholes
  some phone puzzle game with big nuts to the point where it got a crossover with mario translated in english
i really loved zolda in ryuki he gradually comes to remember what justice is and the scene where he fucks with tiger by telling him hell never be a hero was great
ultraman just got evil mom  kamen rider is still stuck with only evil dads
  thanks for revealing how evil she is before i got a chance to watch it
  sorry anon
  does she suck dick with her glasses on
  put your glasses on nothing will be wrong
  sorry for the late response
how the fuck is there still no rip or iso of the kamen rider blu rays besides i think on a private tracker
  i wish that was the normal transformation for rabbitrabbit and tanktank instead of the goofy looking one we got where he flies over to each piece in midair
pandora box is an invention from evolts race  yet vernage can purify and depurify bottles and control the sky wall  vernages role got shafted after her va got sick right
  thxx anon      being this innocent      i like that one better but it really doesnt fit sento since takumi is more stoic
  yeah she was in the hospital for months
  put my glasses on her
  nah she wasnt in the hospital but did heavily reduce her workload
why didnt katsuragi just make diamonddiamond and gorillagorilla
why didnt sento just make geniusgenius
  the true question is who has the worst fashion sense gentoku or the father from rb  i think they would get well together
  this is what fujioka probably want  to do action films
  why didnt shinobu just make ninjaninja and comiccomic
  he did action movies for like 20 years
  wouldve got in the way of moving around waving around and getting tangled on stuff in motion especially given how long they are
  yeah this  didnt he even do a usa action movie about unfrozen samurai warrior or something
  hes done 5 american movies so far all action  too bad theyre all pretty much zlist
  blade riders only have a limited amount of energy when they transform the numbers on rouze cards tell them how much a card takes usually theres only enough for a few combos and rouzing queen just gives you a second wind
  holy shit its still alive
  is that why king form made kenzaki go berserk after a while cause hes going way past the limit of what he should normally be allotted
so what the fucks up with faiz ending  king is still alive but just badly injured  his waifu is working on healing him  blue smart brain lady is never really explained she just is  takumis hands starts to dust in the episode before but its never brought uo in the last episode
  stay tuned for the year 2024 when kamen rider 555 20 years later happens    really though you could always just watch paradise lost and take that as the true ending if not you can watch kamen rider 4
  yeah the ending was terrible
  you and you  tfw when you havent mastered the shadow clone jutsu for running a train on bitches
  no its because kenzaki has some retarded gene quirk that fuses him with all of his cards at once as king instead of just upgrading his ace armor like it was supposed to do
  kenzaki goes berserk because he fused with all 13 spade undeads the true king form should only fuse him with ace and king but his fusion rate is too high that it glitch out the sic garren king is what blade king should look like without all the undeads imprinted on the armor
  when you put it that way it sounds like less of a quirk and more of an unfortunate debilitating mutation
  based on kamen rider 4s implications my headcanon is paradise lost almost happened but mari and keitaro died during that whole quarry scene and takumi launched a suicide attack on the king that killed them both
  whats with the blade poster    i like the new helmet btw
  its from the heisei forever website where you choose and tweet your favorite heisei rider
  hi i work for hasbro    tyler kowalski is an amateur photographer who finds a mysterious alien artifact during once of his photoshoots upon touching the object he is thrown into an alternate reality where alien monsters from other worlds wreak havoc a voice voice by masahiro inoue in the artifact calls out to him and he metamorphs into the alien warrior decade with the power of other fighters from different worlds at his call he fights off enemies through nine different worlds all seemingly similar to his own     unbeknownst to him the artifact was made by the interdimensional terrorist group called neo shocker and when the monstrous leader of the aliens is defeated in its world the world line moves closer to the original reality their plan is to combine the nine worlds with that of tylers original one to mass a large army to take over timespace    unaware that his actions are causing this to happen tyler must also fight off the dimensional defenders named masked warriors as they see him as the destroyer of worlds can tyler figure out a way to stop the fusion of worlds what do his eyes see as he passes through the nine dimensions    written and storyboarded by geoff johns in collaboration with dc  masked warrior decade airs next year only on the cw  dare to defy
  a voice voice by masahiro inoue  kek
    i love this more than guy fieri ooo
  will the mc be of afican american descent
  if you had to made any of the first nine kamen riders black for masked warrior decade who would you choose
  hibiki
  takumi
  kamen riders black and black rx
  deno i guess
im surprised sougo predicted that woz would temporarily betray him and made it part of his plan
  oh so hes doing the pose this time
  well its overwhelmingly clear that woz is getting fed up and also clearly dislikes geiz
  probably just on the fly thinking i mean if woz didnt do that sougo couldve just goaded ar gaim into opening a portal then tossing the watch in there
i know ghost sucked and all but i feel bad for nishime hes been completely tossed for more inoue
  kamen rider sugar daddy  that movie was unexpectedly creepy
  if he was the director then he deserves it for fucking abandoning the show for months at a time
having watched the first 16 episodes of ghost is the ost the best it has to offer i really like the ost but everything else is just meh
  he is tenkuji takeru
      predicted  are you guys retarded  he knew because hes from the future and that already happened and he went through that he didnt predict shit
  ghost is literally the worst heisei
  takaiwa20 seems to be pretty cool
  oh well then yeah tough shit i guess i mean look at decade he still managed to come out alright despite that
  little black kid wataru boy king of wakanda
  how come knee guards are never actually on knees
  knee guards dont actually align well when theyre attached to an additional fabric layer instead of just strapped directly onto the knees for rider costumes the kneepads are attached onto the bodysuit which in turn misaligns when it stretches
  if that actually happened in the future why does he have the gaim ridewatch then by your logic it means that the ridewatch is still in the fake helheim and geiz is still trapped there
    been thinking about this a lot now and always wondered why they havent progressed from this kind of suit design it was really janky as fuck to look at during the exaid and lvl 0 genm team up episode a nice close up shot on how awful that looks
  stable time loop alternatively hes changing the future but his past is also changing so as the events are changed so do his memories
  nigger woz only went with the timejackers because there were two sougos
  the alignment issue can be averted if they do proper straps for the knee armor similar to rollerblading kneeguards but then theyd be kinda jarring and disruptive to the design
  kamen rider amazon  kamen rider black / black rx  kamen rider ouja  kamen rider skull  oc kamen rider ____ uses suika / watermelon lockseed also uses budou as secondary lockseed
  masked warrior decade  not masked rider legacy  
  agito
im guessing tsukasa is either at his lowest point or is pretending to be evil again for the big reveal later on i just hope hes doing this to help everyone otherwise i feel like sougo might actual wind up killing him later to resolve shit
  budou uses genesis belt
  no it doesnt
  not really look at it from tsukasas pov he probably either suspects or already knows sougo will become oma zio his job as decade is to travel the worlds solving their problems this worlds biggest problem right now is oma zio he may be preemptively trying to take out sougo to solve the problem of course nine episodes means they get to flesh his character out a lot more than the other guests so hell probably have a miniarc of his own where at the end he either betrays the jackers and helps sougo or just leaves zios world after entrusting sougo with the rest then shows up near the end with all the heisei riders in tow to help sougo against the final villain
  at his lowest point  omg are you saying hes taking creepshots of hora and selling them for 5000 yen a piece where can i buy them
  sold
shit boys i found my old hdd i have my rider folder back
  faiz hibiki and kiva just straightup make masked warrior kiva into blade
  im not sure what this filename means but its from 2015 i think this was during maurice posting

  you remind me a lot of eiji if only geiz was as half as good as ankh
  this is actually pretty funny
  not him but that was more of a question than a claim
  any chance youre coming back for zio
  man i fucking wish wataru was coming back
anyone want a fan art book    
  hed have to be played by the gunman roidmude/cait sith guy
  or mr j from faiz  or that one phantom who was black
  geiz actor jokingly telling people to stop replying with gayz on his recent pictures with sougos actor or else hell stop uploading them  tfw he deleted the tweet a while after posting
are you ready /krg/
whats the context
so is there actually a source for any of this shit        none of it is actually in either of those answer videos and frankly it all kinda sounds like some vaguely /krg/ flavored bullshit someone made up to sucker people since it was posted right around the time actual translations were being posted kinda sad if people are just taking some anons masahiro fanfiction at face value
  it was posted right around the time actual translations were being posted  arent the posts all by the same guy
  then post the real translations
  im not sure but those sound pretty legitimate given masahiros personality
ive not been paying attention when did keitaro get blonde hair and why
  orange/brown rather
  i wouldnt know its 4chan its anons all the way down it could have been the same guy who intentionally threw in some bullshit alongside legitimate translations or some other anons who tried to capitalize on the timing to troll    there were real translations posted these      which correspond to this video    but thats pretty much it theres a couple of questions after the one he answers with mutekiillusionclock up etc but nothing from those later posts
  implying /krg/ trolls post comfy stuff  you must be new here /krg/s trolls only spread stuff like ______ is an ass who hates his role/rider/toku
  dont forget isnt _____ in jav
  arent shizuka and natsumi in jav
  isnt kenzaki in jav
akiyama eris short movie      伊藤陽佑監督  出演  秋山依里  渋江譲二  川口真五  栩原 楽人  宮崎奈穂子  主題歌  私あなたに恋をした
  neo decadriver  the term neo heisei was actually a thing all along    onore dikeido
  isnt she  nana instead 
        cool shoops 10/10
  aww no final form rides for neo heisei riders
  i dunno making people falsely believe that masahiro is going to have an extended 9episode role in the show sounds like trolling it may sound comfy but the result is still likely just disappointment
  thats takaiwa as decade right
  w memories  ooo hawk tiger hopper  fourze rocket  wizard axe  gaim orange  drive tridoron  ghost dinner  exaid controller  build buntank
  dat belly flab  onore takaiwa
neo   decadriver  neo  heisei
  neo hero  neo legend
why do people hate the phrase neoheisei again because its not official
  because it doesnt make sense its still the heisei era
  yeah but its not like eras have phases either
  its like calling the nazis neonazis
  i knew they were gonna half ass this but still cool    still hoping for a csm release fixing this down the line
  im pretty sure these are fake since its listing a zio card and theres no page up on pbandai
  it doesnt look like a pbandai thing
  i am sure one of the lines would be arent your hair white
        its actually saying that the super ancient warrior is going to use the ridewatchs power to transform    so yeah were getting riku as a kuuga no godai
  seriously though what did he say
  did anybody else notice that theres a huge w on his chest armor
  no it just says that the kuuga ridewatch is in rikus tomb and zio or geiz subject is vague its japanese after all is going to transform into kuuga armor using the power of that ridewatch there is no mention of riku being revived or godai being there in the text
  everybody please stop posting gay on my twitter theres nothing gay about my color either meanwhile please look out for my upcoming photobook
  no it just says that a mighty warriors tomb contains the kuuga ridewatch and that itll turn into another kuuga
  kane kosugi played jiraiya ninja black in kakuranger and hes technically american heck his character was shown to speak broken japanese in the first few episodes
  
  and zio or geiz subject is vague its japanese after all is going to transform into kuuga armor using the power of that ridewatch  it doesnt mention kuuga armor at all though just that the kuuga ridewatch that is with the ancient warrior will be used to transform     and we know geiz isnt transforming into the kuuga armor so riku is the only one it can be talking about in that image
  true but its a ridewatch it is most likely the kuuga armor ridewatch and not another kuuga watch you know since geiz is shown there and not tid or the time jackers trio
  thats tid in the geiz suit
  but the kamen rider series has phases
  kamen rider has phases  evolt has phases  evolt  kamen rider
  the fucks your problem
  fuck  you
  ah fuck you leatherman
  remember back when takaiwa had abs
  why would decade ever want to turn into zio when his powers are just watered down versions of his own except maybe to use the gaim armor for that sick six wielding swords
  kamen rider decadezio decade armor
   ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddio
  final formride
  my japanese is a bit rusty but im pretty sure you misunderstood the tweet i think it says  everyone   stop calling me gayz  whatever it is youre doing just stop lmao  i wont upload that kind of pictures anymore unless you stop ok  色々 doesnt mean color it literally translates to various or several and hes trying to say that there are a lot of things the fans should stop saying/doing the last line has like a teasing tone that suggests that if the fans want to see more gay shit they should behave themselves
you know even though its been used in sentai a ton i could go for a good dinosaur themed rider
  damn right
neo decadriver  neo amazons driver    omega form confirmed
  omega what
reminder that diend will be ziend of zio
  id actually like to see that it pretty much looks like a decade upgrade anyway
  omega time
  you dont say i wonder why that is
  it look like decade upgrade because its based on decade
  it changes even zios undersuit unlike the other armors of course its to make it stand out due to it being the first upgrade but itd just look right being used by tsukasa
  that was sarcasm
  or that one phantom who was black  hes the caith sith he mentioned
also the back up singer in ooos opening is black
  no but koyomi is
  its not sarcasm  you didnt use sarcasm tags
  sarcasm tags
  cool
  he doesnt know the 4channelenabled sarcasm tags
  did ohma zio only have blank ride watches on his arms
  did they change oma zios design or is this a different form
  it isnt painted
  why would they remove the gold paint  wouldnt they have to paint the suit gold again afterwards
  actually looks even better except lacking king face tiles
  you have no idea what vinyl figures are do you
  its the toy 4 eyes
  are ultras sentai and rider crossing over
  sentai/ultraman crossover never   it would be perfect
  its just a calendar
  look what have you done sento  
  villain try to retcon his mistakes by replacing the world with a new one
  yes yes yes yes yes y e s   
  fuck i didnt even think of that when i picked that picture
medic time
  theres no joints you idiot
  these are the vinyls figures i think they only have an arm rotation
  ultras look like shit these days
    
  still does more money than super sentai
woz    wizard of oz
  woz was jorel the whole time
got the heisaber and decade watch preordered    today was also the day i realised that if you slap decade on something or make it related to him ill buy it
buy the zio decade armor toy  throw out the figure and give the heisaber to shinkocho decade
  did you buy the decade eyecon
  whats shinkocho
who are the confirmed returning actors for heisei forever so far
  despite not owning the ghost driver yes
  the build gang the taros voice actors and the owner from deno
  the more humanaccurate version of sh figuarts line
zio would provide a decent opportunity for raia to finally get his survive form onscreen  it wont happen
  i want ouja survive
  whats the price i cant find it
  its a shoop
  perfect thank you
  ouja and zolda deserve their survive more
  it literally doesnt even now which should tell you something given sentais doing so poorly though maybe youd justify it with it only airing half the time a toei toku does
  i think you will be disappointed to find that kaito is not returning to play 2 riders ziend does exist but he is not kaito  it sounds as if you want to try to end the story early before it goes in a direction you wont like
  it was more of a pun than anything
  that brown dress  fuuuuuck i need more of that please tell me theres more
  ziend does exist   who and what is ziend
  obviously from their name they are a rider from the end of time
what if in zio time reset every 10000 years
  if it was every 4000 years i could say it was kamen rider rudras
  thatd be interesting like zio has to delay or prevent time resetting because humanity as we know it will be undone i guess thats not a bad thing per se
just fucking remembered that decade is in tonights episode    oh fuck
new thread      
  itll be a legit waste if they didnt have ride watches for omega and alpha
  a neckbeard would have picked someone cooler than fucking alain
thoughts
this image is dumb and so was the original
    war is superficially exciting and attractive from the outside and its only when youre in the midst of it that you stop finding it exciting or attractive for the most part see all the people who admire tanks jets etc despite those being real military platforms that kill people on the regular making it look exciting or cool but having the people involved not see it that way or care is just more accurate really    if youre the kind of person thatll see a war story about how how the war is fucking up the people or society involved and just go but its really cool looking therefor none of the rest of the message involved matters then youd probably find some way to ignore or actively dismiss the message regardless of who the combat was depicted having the fighting be cool doesnt detract from the rest it doesnt really compliment it either its just another thing
  i dont agree with this us military admissions went up after big war films like american sniper and platoon i think form often works against theme and content even if a screenplay is designed to tell you war is bad if the form of a film intentionally or unintentionally expresses the awe of war and combat then some are going to find it exciting and i personally feel its extremely hard to show battles and especially mechanical instruments without feeling some awe
  not reading this for a shitty meme
tldr
  war is bad is the most hypocritical and shallow message and people who think they are superior to others because they see that sort of message in a cartoon are also hypocritical and shallow  the media companies dont preach against war the media companies have no interest in binding themselves to any messages in the same way they use the visceral appeal of war to attract people who are willing to buy toys they use the image of moral superiority to attract people who need cartoons to stroke their egos
  i am not saying that war is not bad i am saying that thinking that a statement as trivial as that has a moral weight on its own is dangerously stupid
  denier  it was obviously a simulation wtc never existed free your mind sheeple

why does /m/ care what people who dont know what newtypes are think of gundam
  how can you tell that person doesnt know what a newtype is its not like its obscure knowledge
  if you understand newtypes youve probably seen 0079 and you get what the themes are about if you understand the antiwar themes you probably understand that theres more to uc gundam than just cool robots so anyone who only thinks of gundam in relation to cool robots probably doesnt give a shit about the universe so why waste time caring what they think
the original made a good point presented in a bad way at least the gundam one the warhammer original was 100 right  this makes a bad point and presents it in a bad way
  the original made a good point presented in a bad way    more like some newfag shitter came across gundam recently and think hes clever by pointing his observation out to everyone on this board    meanwhile everyone who is not a braindead retard has already discussed the subject that he was talking about to death 20 years ago and just moved on and go back to looking at the cool robots
  i always assumed the gundam one was the original what is the warhammer one
  the warhammer one isoh look cool space marines and 40k demonstrates that fascism is bad somehow even though that doesnt make sense at all
  even though that doesnt make sense at all  really you dont see how that makes sense i think i know who you voted for
  when you kill spacenoids
  obtuse rubber goose green moose guava juice
its almost as if saying stupid shit requires very few words but thoroughly debunking that stupid shit requires a lot of words    you cannot present an intelligent thought in just a couple words
  alright now thats just offensive
burgas seems like a pretty shitty place to live
  its pretty nice in the summertime outside of that youre pretty much right
    was that what rogue trader was about
  is the imperium really a fascist state though its totalitarian yes but it has to be because its under siege from all sides including from within
  
  is that really what the point of evangelion was supposed to be
  yes  did you watch it
  its clearly  wow cool organic robots  kaiju with phallic imagery
no one shows war realistically and for a reason vietnam was not lost on the battlefield it was lost in the living rooms of america when people see war for what it really is theyre turned off to it
  what about idi i smotri
  nice pic you got there senpai
  ty
  but seriously though why does a bulgarian think he has any right to chime in on american politics
  
  setting is a universe where theres trillions upon trillions of monsters that can buttfuck you 1000x times kills you flays your soul and rape your soul some more ie till eternity  dude its abt the negatives of fascism    i really hope this is poes law in effect and not made in any sincerity
  you sound like the kind of person who thinks scifi nullifies the need for suspension of disbelief heres a good explanation of why the imperium is fascist      a story with space monsters can still negatively portray fascism you know you act as if theyre mutually exclusive when in reality theres no connection
  the problem isnt the potrayal of fascism because i agree that it exists the point here is this is a grimdark setting so having a fascismesque form of government as the last bastion of hope for humanity is a suitable setting    realistically speaking nobody sane is going to practice democracy in a 40k setting and waste valuable time and resources bickering over the legalization of the 1231209706th gender and how khorne is apparently wearing a wig that looks like a deadcat
  strange example considering the setting clearly supports the existence of nonbinary genders so in 40ks universe its not so much a debate as it is an established fact
  meme image making fun of poor attempts a humour  american politics
  clearly supports the existence of nonbinary genders    i am pretty sure that falls under heresy since slaanesh is the major player in that department     i am not here to debate 40k lore the point i am trying to make here is whether anyone like it or not fascism is both the most logical form of government in that setting because humanity needs to be working under a singular purpose to even survive in that universe because there are countless things trying to kill you out there    commenting that 40k is somehow a criticism against fascism shows the maker assuming if it wasnt made as a joke of the image as an idiot who probably have no understanding of the 40k setting theres nothing clever about it and is a shitty attempt of making everyone mad because it triggers american politics discussion which is always a cancerous and tiring topic    everyone who tries to point out how retarded the edits are are met with witty oneliners going hurr le mad political side shut the fuck up already and go back to discord
  thoughts  a thoroughly dumb image your attempt to criticize the original criticization falls flat on its face yes we know gundam fails at its antiwar message because of marketing what your image does is explain the joke ie youre a fucking autist
40k and gundam have one very important thing in common they are toylines first and stories second
  gundam fails at its antiwar message because of marketing  it doesnt fail at all i can appreciate the aesthetics of a fictional war without rejecting the idea that war is shit for people who live it
  it doesnt fail at all  no it completely fails at it every major character is a soldier and they fight even the good ones its not antiwar its prowar if youre the good guy
  every major character is a soldier and they fight  what is tragedy
  a tragedy would be an antiwar character dying in the horrors of war being an antiwar soldier is just being a hypocrite
  bulgarias a fucking horrible place to live especially outside of sofia
  being an antiwar soldier is just being a hypocrite  actual fucking brainlet who didnt listen to a word out of the mouths of the protagonists and is also historically illiterate
  every soldier who isnt a psychopath is antiwar are you okay anon
  war is hell isnt an inherently pacifistic message unless youre a blithering moron if the alternative is rolling over and dying or submitting to a totalitarian regime that considers genocide a viable political strategy then you just have to fight knowing that youll inevitably take your lumps along the way    the message is not never fight anything ever its seriously consider if you really want to do this because it sucks    this point is made most clearly in a wakening of a trailblazer where it is explicitly stated that humanity cant permanently put an end to hostilities unless setsuna establishes communication between the species but since hes out of commission the only choice until then is to blow up els before they absorb all of humanity    its not exactly subtle about it in uc either though gihren being compared to hitler as the feds invade establishes the casus belli its as righteous a war as righteous war gets for all of the federations flaws but even despite that amuro is irrevocably changed by war the trauma he goes through he never really recovers from he comes back to fight in spite of the pain and thats what makes him a hero
  how the fuck do you even know hes bulgarian also as another one i have the rightbecause you fucks influence the rest of the world with your autistic screeching you call elections
  anyone who only thinks of gundam in relation to cool robots probably doesnt give a shit about the universe    mfw i know a guy who literally said this
      im not even reading your angry shitposts    heres the fact less than 10 of gundams narrative is devoted to any antiwar sentiment the other 90 is glorifying war through hardware detail battle scenes good guys beating the bad guys miraculous feats of war heroes etc     whatever antiwar themes gundam attempted fall to the wayside against the flood of war glorification the thing you absolute morons dont understand is that even showing the chaos of war glorifies it its like apocalypse now it may have started as an antiwar sentiment but all it does is excite those most drawn to war     all those people in japan who grew up loving gundam theyre in the jsdf or theyre worthless otaku japan had come to glorify the military more since gundam was introduced not less
  solid post heres a blog entry that says the same thing you did but goes a bit more indepth about it inb4 tumblr unsurprisingly no sjwisms in it  
  people pushing the whole cyberpunk is left wing agitprop thing hard     ho boy
  replace war with conflict
  no i joined the army after watching tons of real war footage it was great best thing i ever did and being deployed was fucking awesome
  theyre not angry and theyre not shitposts
  battle scenes  ah yes those glorious scenes of characters dying horrible deaths for very little good reason  good guys beating the bad guys  gundam  good guys  bad guys  at best theres bad guys and notasbad guys  miraculous feats of war heroes   miraculous feats of people people forced into a shitty situation and trying to survive  you are 110 the stickman going wow cool robot  flood of war glorification  what fucking glorification war is portrayed as painful saddening largely pointless and avoidable and only comes about in the first place because people are tremendously flawed  even showing the chaos of war glorifies it   youre really going to need to clarify how portraying war in a negative light is portraying war in a positive light  apocalypse now  you cant seriously be telling me you took a prowar message from apolcalypse fucking now  all those people in japan who grew up loving gundam theyre in the jsdf   any soldier worth his salt should be antiwar and still there are things worth fighting for
  ah yes those glorious scenes of characters dying horrible deaths for very little good reason  you see this is what i call you a moron that stuff isnt antiwar the chaos of war attracts people just as much as it revolts others read my post you delusional fuck
  the chaos of war attracts people  it doesnt attract anyone whos actually absorbing the what the show is telling them you spastic nobody with their head on right is attracted to the idea of having all their friends die and working themselves nearly to death just so they can avoid dying for a political conflict they have very little actual stake in and had nothing to do with initiating  gundam the show makes no secret of it its completely upfront about it war is shit but if you dont fight you die and dying is even shittier if your takeaway is wow cool war then youre either not paying attention or youre too low iq to process something more complicated than a binary statement  read my post you delusional fuck  from the guy who stopped one sentence into mine  fuck off
  it doesnt attract anyone whos actually absorbing the what the show is telling them  no true scotsman fallacy fuck off retard
  law and economics are the pillar of society
  no true scotsman fallacy  no im just calling you a mentalist not saying you dont exist in fact its acknowledging you exist it was ad hom  now are you going to deal with the actual argument or not
  gundams message isnt even war is bad its about how younger generations are the only ones capable of making change and if youre older than 19 you may as well fucking kill yourself cause youre responsible for all the issues going on these days you old faggot
  if youve been reading the thread he already admitted to it
  gibson invented cyberpunk and he absolutely is left wing    your move
  pretty sure its more along the lines of the next generation will always inherit the problems caused by the mistakes of the previous generation the problem in this particular instance just so happens to be a terrible war
  fighting for independence is a bad thing now   hrrrmmmm
  let me guess youre pretending to be retarded
  if zeon is bad then so is america if youre gonna sit here and tell me my country is bad let alone that im retarded for thinking it isnt then were gonna have a problem buddy
  fighting for independence
  it doesnt attract anyone whos actually absorbing the what the show is telling them  nice fallacy brainlet
  my country  why do zeon fans always roleplay when zeons actions are discussed
  im american you fucking idiot and the image isnt talking about zeons cause its talking about the atrocities committed in the name of independence
  nick land  william gibson
  independence  
  dropping a colony is no worse than dropping a nuke if you think taking desperate actions to maintain peace then youre fucking retarded you american as if
  theres a significant difference between dropping a nuke near the end of a conflict and dropping a fucking space colony onto the planet from orbit in the opening phase of a war not to mention that the abombs killed thousands the colony drop killed millions    so yes its worse by several orders of magnitude
  im not even reading your angry shitposts  ok then i wont read yours and hopefully well end this stupid discussion
  zeon was also already independent long before they started dropping the colonies
  declaring you are independent  being independent
  that is the point i was making
    i like some of them
i think its an oversimplification of the themes and messages made by the many different writers that have worked on the gundam series in service for an epic le wokeman take ecks dee
  didnt they retcon it into the federation embargoing them from everything so thats why the war started
  this one is even dumber than the original
  dont lump british scifi writers japanese cartoonographists and italian futurists with american conservatives please
  short jokes good  many words bad
  how can one be actually absorbing what the show is telling them and still be attracted to war
  not just the sf writers all of the best writers in british history have been conservative
  the colony drop was done with the same intent as the nuke to end the war as soon as possible it just didnt succeed
  why didnt it succeed
  in the op case absolutely
  it also involved murdering everyone on the colony to even begin the operation and missed its intended target killing more innocent people nobody had to gassed to build the abombs
  feddies intervened
  not him but for starters it missed its intended target entirely thanks to the efs interference it did however cause calamity around the world anyways and the total annihilation of sydney
  oh i guess that justifies the nucking of innocents then
  such as
  disraeli tolkein conan doyle kipling hardy
    this should be the unit 01 surrounded by rei and asuka shooting a bullet that says stop finding escapism in anime and the viewer says wow cool waifu
  appropriately enough evangelion characters are pretty low tier as far as waifuworthy characters go
  you can chalk up their popularity to their designs which are really fantastic but i agree as far as waifus go their personalities are not really compatible for that sort of thing
  never said it justified anything but one is much worse than the other      i dont know how anyone can have a waifu or husbando from eva as far as im aware every character in that show is a terrible person in their own special way
  pen pens pretty sound id marry him
  im i the only one that doesnt find anything all that special about their designs the design of the school uniforms and plug suits is really nice but it just doesnt to anything for them and the use of hair ornaments is really lazy
  same way you have zeon fans my smooth brained friend
  liking zakus is not the same as liking war my voidheaded friend
  deliberately strawmans the response and denies the existence of zeon not zaku fans in order to make a copycat insult post  creatively bankrupt intellectually dishonest and ultimately fucking stupid congrats
what the dickens is going on in this thread
  politically obsessed shitheads having a proxy argument by masquerading it as a gundam argument
  also what the fuck are the chances of a tiny country like bulgaria of all places having two people in the same thread on one of the slowest boards on the site what in the world is drawing all these bulgarians to /m/
  /m/  connecting people
  make it three maybe we are extra autistic
  what the fuck and the ip count not increasing means you were already in the thread apparently bulgaria is the number one mechaloving country in the world
  technically thatd be italy as far europe is concerned at least    though granted italy is not too far from bulgaria so balkan peninsula perhaps
  you didnt fight a real war
  maybe its the ides will that we should gather here
  anime was never popular in bulgaria as it was in italy though you know commies and shit
  we should have had poorly dubbed uc gundam stuff on tv during the 80sin order to satiate the populus craving for western culturebut not assisting the americans then my dadd understand why i have all these fucking gunpla in my room
  l
  and got more people killed as result i might add
  greetings from south of your border    please come to our beaches and pay tourism money k thanks
  creatively bankrupt intellectually dishonest   youve still not actually addressed any of my points relating to what the show was trying to communicate only the cheap shots i tacked on to call you a mong  denies the existence of zeon not zaku fans  i dont at all lots of people like zeon i think zeon are pretty neat they had sympathetic grievances and lots of their soldiers were thoroughly humanised which made it tragic when they were swatted like flies by the gundam it would have been better if there had been no war and they didnt have to die far away from home at the hands of someone who didnt want to be there in the first place liking a fictional faction is not the same as thinking war is good you dense twat it is because i like zeon that i know the war was a tragedy because it meant all of those nice zeeks like ral and hamon or garma or any of those poor fucking mooks had to die senseless and painful deaths  perhaps one day youll be able to disentangle wars from the people who fight them and then you will actually understand a show aimed at 12 year olds
  nice passiveaggressiveness faggola  cant even speak up on an anonymous image board
  if so that makes zeons whole casus belli even dumber because its assumed that if you want to be independent you need to be selfsufficient
  yeah but those people are fucking dumb
anyone got the kr one
  if you actually read the thread instead of frothing in anger at that post youd have seen multiple people discussing why 40k demonstrates that fascism is bad
  fuck off
  nah
  takahashis conservative you faggot also heinlein is conservative
  uh the original writers from the 1980s onwards have said this it is part of the tradition of british ironic sci fi like dredd and the 2000 ad works reeeeeee
  both of those people suck i listed all the greats
  who did he vote for i cant think of any fascist candidates of any kind of international significance that has run for an office in the current decade
  the least this board needs is our camp vs their camp bullshit    youve got the rest of the internet for that crap stop trying to make every niche corner of the internet part of your ideological warfare rubbish
  what makes you think gundam is anticolony drop but pronuke thats actually retarded gundam is obviously antiwmd in general especially wmd aimed at civilian centres theyre all bad colonies are just the worst
  really you single out that post for our camp vs their camp bullshit when thats what this whole thread has been like are you just so fucking dumb you dont see it when its not explicitly stated
  takahashi isnt conservative
  nukes are so bad that even zeon agreed not to use them again after only a few weeks of warfare
    both are correct tbf i would make one with the hinus fin funnels saying these along with amuro being my mommy and adults who are abused will grow up to be abusers without self awareness read char as another point
  i know for certain id rather have zeon vs federation shitposts than the same tired american dickmeasuring contests the rest of the anglosphere internet has been plagued with these past few years    fuck off back where you came from you troglodyte
  both of these people suck  only if youre an artschoolgraduate faggot who cant appreciate good art
  colony drops are more ecologically safe like part of chars reason for getting humanity out of earth and into space had to do with environmental concerns
  only after theyd devastated the earth with wmds of their own origin pretty explicitly states that the antarctic treaty ban on wmds  including colony drops gas attacks and nukes  was more a convenient way for zeon to eliminate the most effective means the earth had for dealing with them
    no though some data books and manga have suggested thats the case no uc animation has though it doesnt particularly make sense either since the entire purpose of the colonies is that they be self sufficient and almost every colony has a ring of agricultural pods at one end while the sides mine from asteroids for raw materials    more than that both side 6 and jupiter are confirmed to be neutral factions that zeon can trade with so any embargo would be a formality at best given goods could simply be funneled through either of those places doing so would increase the price but when something is already coming from earth to the far side of the moon diverting through another side isnt going to add significantly to the price        the difference is that america tried numerous times to get the japanese to surrender at various battles without success and made overtures for surrender without any response so dropping a bomb was seen as being a way to save not just american gis since it was calculated that an invasion would take so long and be so hard fought but that itd save japanese lives too since they wouldnt spend years fighting battles over every square inch of the country either    its also worth remembering that in 1945 no one knew just how devastating over the long term a nuke was and the us just thought of it as a big bomb and also that for all the nukes are what everyone including the japanese remembers america had already fire bombed a dozen or more cities in to rubble using traditional bombs without any movement towards surrender by japan the only reason hiroshima and nagasaki were chosen despite being relatively small metropolitan areas is because they were the biggest cities still standing the japanese diet didnt even convene when word reached them that the americans had used a single bomb to destroy either city    zeon opened with a weapon of mass destruction american closed with one after trying other options
    source because while i know its popular to suggest hitting something other than jaburo would cause more devastation the reality is that a single unbroken piece hitting brazil would probably cause more death given that brazil has a much larger population and that it would probably cause greater geographical and environmental destruction too since one large piece will hit one area a lot harder than three smaller pieces hitting separate areas will
  i kinda remembered this way back anyways i typed my autistic rant because resetera/discord trannies wants to turn everything into a political debate what kind of brainlet assholes doesnt know 40k imperium and zeon are facist governments they think they are superior by trying to make us feel bad for enjoying/supporting certain fantasy settings because it doesnt align with their political compass but by complaining it shows that they have almost no understanding of the setting they are complaining about    tourists and idpol shills keep screaming about how /pol/ is spilling everywhere but all i see is them trying to inject their toxic discussions into everything including our hobbies
  how safer are asteroid drops to colony drops
  thread should have ended here
  no finding escape in fiction  wew
    i imagine its more moderate escapism is fine and stop running away from active problems impacting your life instead of dealing with them
  that would be more appropriate
  takahashi is not conservative votoms encourages free thinking which is the opposite of being conservative
  
  not only is this not an argument but it clearly says here that this series was created by some other guy named aramaki you really had to reach to find some vaguely fascistic series that takahashi had screenwriting duties on and use it as an example which does not bode well for your argument
i mean i agree but at the same time the existence of nuclear weapons means were never going to have another ww2 unless we just choose to not use them so its irrelevant
  conservative  fascistic  freudian slip
  what did he mean by this
  not that guy but i think your reading comprehension is pretty shit he called the series vaguely fascistic while saying takahashi having screenwriting duties is a poor argument for the guy claiming takahashi is conservative
  the war wouldnt be fought in the same slow arduous way there wouldnt be valiant heroes on made on the battlefields there would just be a flash heat and it would be over
  now thats backpedaling
  lol samefag  illiterate moron
  ishinomori too if we go by american meme labels
  that and lots of shitty lowlevel conflicts that you can barely call a war where everyone pussyfoots around and is afraid to use the big guns
  i mean you said it not me
  yeah but its from da bad ending tho  no acknowledging it except for memes
  are you retarded rhetorical 
  nah nukes are for nation states to fight with and theyve worked out its more palatable to fight each other with economics the future of actual warfare is independent militias fighting stateowned fleets of remotelypiloted vehicles
  in unicorn the feddies tried to destroy site7
since when the message of gundam is that war is bad i never get this memes whoever started it must be a a complete naive moron    the real message is that war sometimes is a mean to an end yes war sucks but in the end of the day you have to point your beam rifle to zaku to protect your friend and to make the world a better place you have to fight against your enemies you cant realistically achieve a peace without killing authoritarian regime who wants to drop space colony into your planet
  while i agree with you i think uc gundam does still have an overarching antiwar theme but it isnt neccessarily against war as institution its certain kinds of wars wars predicated by the petty whims of ambitious politicians and high ranking military officers wars justified by blind faith in an ideology wars fought for the sake of conquest its something that all the antagonist factions have in common they all fall into one of the three categories
  bullshit
   since when the message of gundam is that war is bad    since everything 0080 and beyond
    those are not mutually exclusive messages just because a war is necessary doesnt mean its not still an awful process that corrupts or destroys everything it touches
  funny you criticize for lack of reading comprehension then insinuate i was mad because of something i never even mentioned in my post  so basically youre both a bitch and a retard
  bro there are a lot of brainlets who think that dredd did nothing wrong or zeon is good or that the imperium is an ideal state of mind when half of the point of say horus hersey is that the imperiums inherent situation doomed itself to the nightmare world that is 40k    i do agree with you though its like between the idpol and the /pol/ its like out out
  yes but it also says war is a fundamental failure of humanity tomio works are consistent that war is a sign that people have failed their moral duty to keep the peace and that no matter how just your cause is civilians suffer and soldiers have trauma that will be brought back to haunt future generations
  you arent wrong either half the point of the episode where amuro meets his mother is the rejection of the sort of mindless absolute pacifism in the face of moral evil
  fascism is murder  fanaticism destroys  imperialism is unsustainable  i mean neither of these are wrong none of them argue whether theyre bad or not like people itt are mentioning
  except the times they gassed a few colonies zeon has been the best governing force for spacenoids feddies just gas zap and treat spacenoids like thirdclass citizens that come the time of f91 spacenoids want independence from the federation again
buy the toys
    yes and it was specifically angling the notion about how his mom didnt understand the reality of war and judging amuros action based on her pacifist lens is what makes their relationship jumping the shark at that very moment i came out hating pacifist after watching that episode so if gundam was trying to bring me to the camp of war is bad it actually did the opposite to me         0080    yeah this is correct 0080 is probably the only single gundam show that is actually sending the message that war is bad for civilian this is probably why i got a little bit repulsed when watching it it sent different message than 0079 and zeta for sure
  based
why did everything suddenly get so quiet
  and what was char fighting for how was char going to make the world a better place the answer is by making everyone newtypes a new evolution of humans that understand each other and have no need for war
  gundam has been antiwar since the beginning  theyve just been prosoldier at the same time which is a slightly more nuanced view than war is bad
  is there a single /m/ or /a/ franchise that just outright says war is bad without any but or except added in
  its explictly the theme of devilman
     and what was char fighting for    revenge and later to prove himself better than amuro     how was char going to make the world a better place    he wasnt     the answer is by making everyone newtypes a new evolution of humans that understand each other and have no need for war    he doesnt care about any if that in 0079 and he doesnt ever care about the last part
  its implied that newtypes would have no need for war since they can truly understand eachother thats the whole point of 0079
  yes but thats comprehensively proven untrue by reality
    what does that matter that thats implied doesnt mean char ever gave a fuck about it
  its just that chars vision of a place where newtypes can be newtypes is unattainable and can never happen
    also that his vision isnt something cares much about compared to revenge in 0079 he mentions it once never has a plan for it never pursues it and even in the one mention of it while talking to sayla he directly states that hes not so foolish as to think one man can create something like that
  newtypes would have no need for war since they can truly understand eachother  this is why uc will never catch on in the west
  kamille understood scirocco so well that the best course of action was to ram into him
  yes
  i like zeta but it ruined newtypes kamilles newtype abilities are basically super powers which is something tomino specifically said newtype abilities were not meant to be
  ruins newtypes in his very second show  wow tomino sure is a genius    so this is why people say 0079 is the only good gundam and even then it was canceled so you have to read the book instead
  cool robot
  he was a formidable opponent
    i get the feeling that the only reason newtype powers werent more explicit in 0079 was because it was cancelled and that if the show had been able to run its course theyd probably have been more in line with what was done with them in zeta zz  chars counterattack nothing in the novels is on that level but even in the novels amuros ghost communicates with others after hes died for instance
good points
  this anyone who uses that war is bad image unironically and i have seen it done before is a retard essentially believing that the moral is to surrender to oppressive genocidal conquerors war is hell as further explained by  is a much more appropriate summary because while gundam certainly shows that shit happens in war there still remains a just reason for the heroes to fight      but this most of all
huh
gundam finally clicked and im enjoying it a lot but im a bit wary to go forward how true is the gundam has deep intricate politics thing and gundam is just a toy commercial
  how true is the gundam has deep intricate politics thing and gundam is just a toy commercial  gundam has deep intricate politics compared to many other toy commercials
  except at least america didnt kill roughly half the human population and gas innocent civilians with literally 3 seconds of warning
  gundam has deep intricate politics  uc gundam is my favorite sci fi universe earth federation zeon neozeon aeug are all pretty interesting and none of them are just bad guys   gundam is just a toy commercial  gundam would probably be way different if they didnt have to sell toys its the most apparent in 0079 which is unfortunate
  both are true
why are zeon even attacked white base is it just to get gundam i dont really understand their independence war if theyre already independent in their cylinder thing
  im not even reading  the absolute state of /m/ debater
  debater  let me guess bulgarian
  what is the state of bulgaria during the oyw
  its kills mobile suit like your dad beat you
  probably annexed by zeeks
killing people is bad unless they are the bad guys the thread
  why do they call them zeeks is it like how racists say commies
  its because they glorify zeon and everything about it plus calling them zeons doesnt sound that well
  google is surprisingly bad at finding older things these days so i cant link anything about it but the zeek and feddie stuff was actively a choice made by the earliest of gundam translators back in the vhs days loose translations meant to make the dialogue read and sound natural and have an old school war vibe rather than sounding stilted if it was left literal    those were the days before the japan side took an active interest in translation or had come up with their standardized official names and terms to follow so it became a thing that stuck over time despite not really being present in the original    it honestly works out because its more memorable than zeons and federation when theyre used as curses or insults
  zeeks and feddies started with the early official usa release   they werent in the old fansub days i forget if it was nadelman mark simmons or who but i do think there is a specific person credited for them    but yeah basically its just so theres more ways to kisama some yatsus so they made up some slurs since slurs against your opponent is an important part of the englishspeaking war experience
  zeeks and feddies started with the early official usa release  this its also probably to avoid them for being called antisemite for putting zionist name in a bad light
we as a species will always enjoy violence and war even of everyone tells us hurting people is bad and other hippy crap we are a violent species of hairless apes who would smash the face of every other male in our viscinity if we were allowed to do it war is tragic when you lose its glorious when you win mind you that japan became a super duper pacifist nation after losing ww2 before that they were all for killing everything in its path its all just blatant hypocrisy from echo chambers and busybodies      you dont teach a child not to put his hand in a fire nor to be afraid of the dark that preprogramed into his caveman brain but you gotta teach the little fucker not to hit people or torture animals dont cha
  fuck off polpig
  you dont teach a child not to put his hand in a fire nor to be afraid of the dark that preprogramed into his caveman brain  actually yes you exactly have to do this
  you enjoy all the killing thats why
  zeon and zion arent even pronounced the same way
  
  its to sell toys
not all media needs to forcefeed a moral or polemic down your throat   also media can include the idea that war is horrible in its themes without being the core message
  this gundam does have antiwar themes but they arent necessarily the main theme of gundam the themes of the next generation paying for the mistakes of the previous and the youth being the only ones capable of changing the future are much more prominent
  but you gotta teach the little fucker not to hit people or torture animals dont cha  because childrens brains are undeveloped and empathy comes a bit later in life as they gain intelligence if what you say is true every kid with shitty or lazy parents grows up into a michael myersesque psychopath with zero morals obviously thats not true fraternity and peace are natural just like violence is
  top oof mladdie
  what a fucking moron throw away the key
    are you the guy who said normal people are just polite sociopaths a few days ago cause you sound like him and that implies a really bad understanding of what a sociopath is at the very least     war is tragic when you lose its glorious when you win    sure because every soldier whose faction won comes home whooping and hollering about how great the war was and there arent legions of soldiers broken by the experience due to the things they experienced while fighting people who refused to even discuss the war with their own family and in many cases are left emotionally and mentally scarred for life     you dont teach a child not to put his hand in a fire nor to be afraid of the dark that preprogramed into his caveman brain but you gotta teach the little fucker not to hit people or torture animals dont cha    yea you do have to teach kids those things fear of snakes or spiders and many other things that seem instinctual is socially absorbed too and while you do have to teach kids to be selective with violence but dont have to teach them the rudiments of violence itself you also do have to teach them to be selective with compassion and dont have to teach them to cooperate toddlers will help other toddlers they perceive to be in distress and young kids are often very free with their possessions the sane kid can be a greedy shit a few minutes later dependant on mood but the point is that the full dichotomy exists and regulation is a learned behavior on both sides not just selfishness or violence
    oh and since i just noticed the animal torture bit in particular most kids have literally no desire to do that at least to any life form they can personally perceive the distress of ants or something they cant understand is usually it a prediliction for animal torture is a warning sign for sociopathic behaviour for a reason and is normally learned from and caused by a shitty home environment where a kid is beat and takes that anger and beating out on others who cant stop them
  nobody watches gundam and goes damn that robot fight was cool therefore we should have wars in real life like this
  well i did used to know someone who said hed join the army immediately if they ever got mecha
cool army
  i think we can all agree mechaporn is a huge point of mecha  but i dont think moral ambiguity a common writing tool in war stories and mixed messages are the same thing
its a hot take i know
i think the main thing that meme image overlooks is that you can be antiwar even strongly antiwar without subscribing to the idea of absolutist pacifism
  if you kill the people who start the wars there wont be any more wars    tomino understood this well which is why it was the main point of greco
  im one of those people who listened to celestial beings declaration to the world and thought yeah im good with that
  i fixed it for you
  thats not true at all you can think war is shit and a tragic affair for everyone involved but you can still think that there are times where it may be necessary when all reasonable options are exhausted and even then you can still be opposed to catastrophic acts of violence against primarily civilian targets like weapons of mass destruction
  my zeon waifu
  left emotionally and mentally scarred for life  the soldiers and their families maybe but not for the unrelated civilians of the winning side wholl bragging about it for many generation despite never enlist nor been drafted
  are you the guy who said normal people are just polite sociopaths a few days ago     nope wasnt me but i always believed you can easily teach someone to be a sociopath or that those ideas and traits are latent in our minds       muh emotional scars     funny how those traits quickly developed from vietnam and onward our first nonheroic war inwhich we had to pack our bags and go home that clothmouthed ptsd haze of the horrors of war are basically nonexistant in any historical document or fictional recounts until about the 6070 hell even korean war veterans in a similar hellscape mentioned their war stories with a smirk     and i dont think youve ever listened to someone who foughy in world war 1 or 2 inwhich theyll recited their derringdos and how many krauts japs and daigos they whipped into shape and took down is war horrific yup but to some far less horrific then others but it does come off that its the miasma and political leanings that shape our minds and feelings does it not     youre telling me that you never got into a fistfight eon then felt even a little good about yourself after doing it ya dont think people feel thst at all during war
  i i think youre completely agreeing with me
  or more likely he is retarded and changes his opinions on a whim
  funny how those traits quickly developed from vietnam  soldiers suffering from ptsd and the like happened as early as wwi its just that people still had that medieval perception that war is a glorious and honorable affair will john smith mention to his missus how he has nightmares about that time he saw 16 year old timothy having his guts skewered by a bayonet of course not because that was how society worked at the time people opened up to deal with their feelings and emotions after traumatic events over the decades soldiers suffering from ptsd is itself a more recent affair only really having it in the last 150 years or so due to a variety of changes on the way war is waged  you seem to be of the opinion every human is a psychopath waiting to happens and i really cant agree with that notion  go find a shrink or something and stop browsing /pol/ as well
  and you seem to think that 37 billion years of evolution where our basic instincts to survive was by ripping other animals apart and eating their flesh suddenly just dissapeared into the ether when we learned how to make houses     shooting people from a far distance should be infinately less traumatic then stabbing a man in his head and watching his blood gush out of the wound so there should have been one just one instance before ww2 shellshock where men pontificated on the lives they had taken and the horrors they had seen on the battlefield sadly theres none zilp zero zilch when it comes to literature which might lead to a corroboration    furthermore just to strengthen my point early cases of shellshock were due to the stress and trauma of loosing your life or your teammates lives nothing to due with the violence youd be inflicting on your enemies so again that trauma has nothing do honestly do with the violence youd inflict on ypur enemies but the violence that can be inflicted on you glory to the victors pacifism to the loser     im not a /pol/tard place is too depressing and i aint saying humans as noble savages what im saying is that if violence is needed as a tool to survive its more useful if you enjoy using it its ehy when we have sex we think of fickibg instead of procreating another generation we do what we enjoy doing thats why we love war so much
  and i disagree with you on that notion humans are varied and complex they cant all be put in the same violence loving box the way you are doing  im going to leave this debate now since you and i are clearly not going to find common ground and i do not want to waste any more time of my life arguing on the internet
last post is around 1800   thread is still on the first page
  wow thats really weird how that works man i guess this is just a really slow board
  but other threads on page 1 have posts from around the time it is now
  thats really weird man must be a glitch
  where our basic instincts to survive was by ripping other animals apart and eating their flesh  interspecies conflict / intraspecies conflict  shooting a rabbit skinning it and taking it to the safety of your home to cook for survival / being stuck in a base/on a ship for x time you lost track after the first 2 weeks with constant bangs and thuds above you guys you know personally never coming back and the constant threat of painful death by gas bullet bayonet or bomb  the conditions goals and methods are so radically different that its dumb to compare the two the conditions of war put you and people youre close to under constant threat of violence winner or no heroic or no   early cases of shellshock were due to the stress and trauma of loosing your life  im fairly sure if you lose your life you dont have to worry about that  nothing to due with the violence youd be inflicting on your enemies   thats not true back in ww2 raf bomber command had a term theyd use for medical dismissal lack of moral fibre lmf that was thought up as a way of getting rid of lads who were experiencing combat fatigue from just flying over germany and dropping bombs on something they rarely actually knew what they were hitting owing to poor conditions and primitive tech hence bcs pretty poor effectiveness record by all accounts
    necrobumping because you have nothing worth to talk 
and i disagree with you on that notion humans are varied and complex they cant all be put in the same violence loving box the way you are doing    all im saying is at the end of the day after we say all our worldpeacepowerranger speeches were still animals and animals enjoy inflicting voilence and war is as natural to us as fucking is doesnt mean were sociopaths just means that were human     i do not want to waste any more time of my life arguing on the internet    why are you on 4chan then          1 please tell me when chimps or ants go to war with each other are they being manipulated by the chimp or ant oligarchy to commit these massive crimes are there chimp jews and ant jews rubbing their feelers as good young chimps and ants go to die for their wars do the chimps and ants fall into a depression about how many other chimp and ant brothers died and how they took the lives of young     also each and every example given about ptsd is not trauma from inflicting violence on someone else but the fear of someone inflicting violence on them youre not disproving my point youre just reiterating the same points made that arent what im bringing up     you hurt me  trauma  me hurt you  fun pasttime
  ants  capable of humanlevel introspection  you dumb boy even chimps dont necessarily have humantier selfconsciousness/awareness and theyre as close as it gets why would you make a comparison with them for an emotional/anxiety disorder  are they being manipulated by the chimp or ant oligarchy to commit these massive crimes  what does an oligarchy or manipulation have to do with it even if you go in willingly it doesnt mean youll come out the other side okay   do the chimps fall into a depression   as it goes theres very little research on chimps postconflict because of a how rare the chances to see shit like the gombe war are afaik its the only documented example and b because youre meant to take a handsoff approach to studying wild animals to make sure behaviours are genuine and you dont manipulate them/fuck their development so actually assessing chimps that have gone to war in the loosest use of the word is nigh on impossible postconflict no one can say for certain though chimps can develop ptsd depression and various mood disorders as we know from captive chimps we just have no way of properly assessing chimps which have waged war  youre setting very weird standards for this that dont generalise to humans very closely in the first place and dont really go anywhere even if they did because of how nearlyimpossible it is to actually look in to and get a definitive answer  each and every example given about ptsd is not trauma from inflicting violence on someone else but the fear of someone inflicting violence on them  i just gave you an example of the former raf bomber commands lmf stamp dropping bombs on people is stressful  a more recent one would be drone pilots again raf example here the rpas pilots who operate from either ne england or nevada us have huge rates of mental stress theyre almost never going to be within 100miles of an enemy combatant they go home every night and still get it
theres a lot to reply to here and i deliberately put off doing so for several days out of laziness so this will get kind of long winded just ignore it if you dont care         nope wasnt me but i always believed you can easily teach someone to be a sociopath or that those ideas and traits are latent in our minds     sociopathy probably is nurture rather than nature but at the same time the only people who seem to be capable of being taught it are young kids whose minds are still forming because any attempts to do anything similar with adults has failed disastrously one of the more common elements for the background of sociopaths is a violent upbringing where they were regularly beat for no reason and started using violence on others to prevent violence to themselves its not something thats common to all sociopaths but its certainly common to a lot its the same reason why hitting children is frowned upon because doing so teaches them that violence is an acceptable and expected reaction to perceived mistakes theres other reason including that it tends to make children try to avoid punishment rather than avoid crimes but thats certainly one of the reasons
you probably cant teach adults to be sociopaths though armies have tried similar things in the past including britain during world war ii they tried to teach trainees to not just see the germans as no longer human but to actively hate the germans and to want to kill them so called hate training doing so always goes badly because its just not easy to teach humans to hate other humans they had some success in isolated training but once the men were on the battlefield they broke in such numbers that it was deemed unfeasible the army prioritizes dehumanizing the enemy rather than teaching soldiers to hate and even that tends to have mixed results cults foster that feeling over time and through continued isolation but many cult members break for the same reason many servicemen did because its just not something most people like and as soon as they interact with other humans on a real basis it tends to break down a lot of the time     funny how those traits quickly developed from vietnam and onward    they didnt ptsd in various forms has probably always existed but only started getting recognized in even the simplest way around the time of the american civil war even then it was just thought of as cowardice which was a common view until vietnam the change in vietnam was not that it suddenly came in to existence its that the number of veterans suffering from it due to the nature of the fighting was too great to ignore or brush off especially when those same veterans were throwing their medals away in public during protests against the war it gave the public greater awareness of the situation and the government greater reason to do something about it because the public was on the veterans side rather than theirs by the mid 60s when that stuff started happening
 that clothmouthed ptsd haze of the horrors of war are basically nonexistant in any historical document or fictional recounts until about the 6070    this is flat out wrong and plenty of personal biographies of the first world war include reference to shell shock personal trauma from the events of the war or disgust for the events of the war theres references in literature to it prior to world war i but world war i is the first war where there were lots of first hand accounts of the fighting both because there were so many involved in the war and because literacy was only really becoming more common around about then     i dont think youve ever listened to someone who foughy in world war 1 or 2    do you understand that some / all there are plenty of accounts from world war i veterans who hated the war that there are plenty who loved it doesnt change that since the same is true of any war     youre telling me that you never got into a fistfight eon then felt even a little good about yourself after doing it    the scale is so different as to make that comparison childish i think plenty of people do go in to war with a similar thought process but not nearly as many come out of the experience with the same view
     you seem to think that 37 billion years of evolution where our basic instincts to survive was by ripping other animals apart and eating their flesh suddenly just dissapeared    the basic instinct for the vast majority of that 37 billion years wasnt anything of the kind because for the vast majority of that our ancestors were either single celled organisms that collected energy by osmosis or more complex but vegetarian its only with about the last 15 million or so years that weve been meat eaters and even then the consensus view seems to be that protohumans were scanvengers who picked already killed carcasses originally and didnt develop in to hunters of their own for another few million years during which meat was never our sole diet and in fact according to the majority of anthropologists women who collected plants were more often the providers with meat as an occasional treat from the odd successful hunt than something regular which is part of what is thought to have cultivated cooperation in humanity because we needed to work together and protect each member in a group so some could hunt some could look for berries/nuts/etc some could look after kids or elders etc thats part of instincts too cooperation and it doesnt just go away either     shooting people from a far distance should be infinately less traumatic then stabbing a man in his head and watching his blood gush out of the wound    and yet it demonstrably isnt because as another anon pointed out not only do snipers get ptsd too but so do drone operators stationed half a world away from their targets
 so there should have been one just one instance before ww2  sadly theres none zilp zero zilch when it comes to literature which might lead to a corroboration    the only way i can imagine you came to this conclusion is that you just didnt look        heres one of the first google results i got for it for antiwar literature     noone better described the mix of shame and anger experienced by the wardamaged than the poet siegfried sassoon in october 1917 while he was at craiglockhart one of the most famous hospitals for curing officers with war neuroses he wrote a poem simply called survivors     no doubt theyll soon get well the shock and strain / have caused their stammering disconnected talk / of course theyre longing to go out again  / these boys with old scared faces learning to walk / theyll soon forget their haunted nights their cowed / subjection to the ghosts of friends who died  / their dreams that drip with murder and theyll be proud / of glorious war that shatterd their pride / men who went out to battle grim and glad / children with eyes that hate you broken and mad    theres not much antiwar literature prior to world war i and its almost impossible to verify how much of it is written by actual veterans a problem especially true for stuff prior to about 1600 and/or outside larger nations but theres definitely antiwar literature written by veterans predating wwii
 furthermore just to strengthen my point early cases of shellshock were due to the stress and trauma of loosing your life or your teammates lives    that was what the early diagnosis was but even the early physicians who made that diagnosis quickly realized it wasnt true     in the early years of world war one shell shock was believed to be the result of a physical injury to the nerves in other words shell shock was the result of being buried alive or exposed to heavy bombardment the term itself had been coined in 1917 by a medical officer called charles myers but myers rapidly became unhappy with the term recognising that many men suffered the symptoms of shell shock without having even been in the front lines    what youre saying is just a roundabout way of calling people cowards because theyre wounded by a fear for their own lives and its exactly the image psychologists have been trying to dismiss with over a century at this point people are not just traumitized because theyre afraid of losing their lives and thinking it is makes no sense when considering the amount of people who fall in to ptsd long after theyve left the battlefield or who never experience a direct threat to their lives     what im saying is that if violence is needed as a tool to survive    it might be for bears or tigers or something its not for humans because humans are omnivores and need a group to survive violence is often detrimental to the group dynamic so enjoying it would lead to more fights for control and endangering the overall wellbeing of the group including any individual         were still animals and animals enjoy inflicting voilence and war is as natural to us as fucking is     animals also regularly cooperate and protect from rats to primates because animals recognize that the good of the group can lead to benefits for the individual too even if only on an instictual level
    oh and the other reason i forgot to include about why it became so public during vietnam is that vietnam is the first major war in which the public had ready access to instant communication from a variety of nongovernment sources television and radio are a lot quicker and more visceral than newspapers
  why are you on 4chan then  for the pictures  and the shit flinging
  the bad ending  its literally the events happening in the movie what are you stupid them congratulating him is the very moment he realizes everything and 3rd impact comes to a end      then he just fucks everything up and unlearns everything he just learned by choking asuka
  people like him are why every piece of media has to spoonfeed people everything these days otherwise they wont get it
thats so true
completely new to the genre  what series should i start with
super sentai power rangers or just tokusatsu
  no like the mechers
aldnoahzero the greatest show from this decade
  youre welcome
giant robo the day the earth stood still  daiguard
  gekigangar 3
  then why show the daizyujin
  mecha is not a genre    mecha is a way of life
  is it not a mecha
  but it pops up images of power rangers so someone would automatically assume toku its like posting a valkirie while wanting to know about gundam
  the only mecha i know is this toy i have seen before in my grandparents basement as a kid
mazinkaiser  shin getter robo vs neo getter robo  mobile suit gundam  sdf macross  the king of braves gaogaigar  martian successor nadesico     also once again asking if anyones made a new version of pic related
  legend of the blue wolves
why did she dress like a big purple penis
  you should go to a psychiatrist
was kicilia a char
  behold for i am  purple penis    i penetrate the mightiest of fortresses
  she dresses up as a penis to compensate for her lack of one    if i cant have a penis i shall b e c o m e the penis
  she was a char before there even was one
  she compensates for her butterface    johnny was a brave man or did he ask her to keep the mask and helmet on  
twenty men had tried to stop her twenty men she has shot dead  twenty men she shot dead with the big iron on her hip
  by the town there lived a soldier by the name of comet red
  by the name of comet red
  bump
  did johnny ever learn about what happened that day
  shes definitely this in 79 origin pretties her up though
  only slightly enough to not make her abysmally ugly and actually look more her age shes still got that sort of strung out and divorced twice cougarsort of face in origin    its still weird that johnny raiden would fall in love with her on any level since 0079 and origin still have her being a bitch only with origin giving her a side that likes to party after she finishes killing people who insult her over petty shit
  dont think so and msvr still hasnt touched upon their relationship in anyway odd considering she gave him the unicorn insignia to use from what the databooks say
  johnny raidenlightning  johnny ridden  how have i not noticed this
  cca retcon where johnny awakens and was the one to push back axis as a fuck you to char never
  no unicorn retelling where matsunaga helps save mineva and helps mentor banana   fights off ff in a souped up gelgoog jager
  space fashion in uc 70s was weird
have you seen her fucking face without that thing they pretty her up for the origin but yikes older kycilia has some rough features
    not just origin her looks are all over the place
  0079 doesnt have her being a bitch at all   she finishes killing people who insult her over petty shit  still the origin never happened in msg dont imagine that your shitty fan fiction is derived in any way from the original series
  dragon dildo
          the thing about johnny is that it may or may not be true so far we kinda know that in msvr he wasnt in love with kcyllia and yes with asia fellow there are lots of different possible johnny riddens like the one from games the one from hasegawa msv etc
  in case anyones wondering what the fuck theyre saying
  man 10 ms seems to be a slow day for mcs nowadays
  yeah but those were the early days of ms warfare where everyone was still getting their feet wet and johnny would be trying to lead his team and protect his fellow pilots/ships than pad his kill count
    i wonder if she could be saved if he dicked her
  nope
  while true just saying a real robot show that doesnt feature bots being wrecked in droves seem weak by comparison
  while true just saying a real robot show that doesnt feature bots being wrecked in droves seem weak by comparison i got vague recollections of a write up of the sandrock supposedly wrecking 50 leos per sortie
  shes still got that sort of strung out and divorced twice cougarsort of face in origin  stop i can only get so erect
  because ridden is a really shit rendering that 100 reads like the pasttense version of ride and not as a homophone for raiden/ライデン but banrise refuse to accept they made a mistake back in 1984 and just press ahead with it  which is a shame because they were man enough to admit they cocked up with zion
    clitoris anon women dress like a big purple clitoris it is a objective and subjective principle to show repression of the most sacred of the womanly elements
  because ridden is a really shit rendering that 100 reads like the pasttense version of ride and not as a homophone for raiden/ライデン but banrise refuse to accept they made a mistake back in 1984 and just press ahead with it  its weird for all the other names theyve wobbled on that theyve kept it ridden forever
  lol they made her attractive in that so that it wouldnt look so weird with ridden romancing a shaved squirrel face
    ive always chalked that up as weird spacenoid name 1285
  because it looks cool
  i think the official reason was that there was an incident an assassination attempt or one of the fights during the one week battle where someone near her died gruesomely and got blood and gibs splattered on her face this traumatized her so she never goes out into high risk areas now without the face scarf out of fear of that happening again    another one ive heard is that she often visited battlefields postbattle and due to the high casualty count of the oyw there were a lot of unburied dead lying around so she started wearing the face mask out of habit because of the smell
  literally every zeek in 0079 looks ugly now that i think about it exceptions being lalah and crowley
  she looks like a bitter and disjointed ms frizzle after years of hard drinking
  dunno about the first story never heard about it but its plausible    the second story is bollocks because kycilia is commander of the mobile assault force which is based in space theres zero reason for her to go to earth and i dont think any supplementary material has ever mentioned her visiting terrestial battlefields so unless she was forced to walk through a poorly kept morgue too many times she wouldnt have been exposed to the smell of death not on a ship or in her base at granada
  she was piloting the adzam together with mquve when attacking the gundam before odessa she was no stranger to the frontlines
  fuck me
real nt  got shaved bald modified into cyber nt and hooked up to a machine because the feddies cant do shit    poor girl
as beautiful as her hair
it is totally ok to release your rage on the feddies
  twin tails  just like her hair
  and then she is found many many years later and is used by mask for one bit
  found  nope they just rebuilt it from blueprints the psycoframe glows a different colour and it probably uses photon battery for power
  so fukui shitting on the feds again  kiki rape
has anyone started calling gundam penis yet
where is the livestream link bros
  its supposed to be on gundaminfo but i dont see anything posted
  
  thanks
based zoltan
  hes gonna be a barrel of laughs if this was anything to go by
feddies are fucking morons what else is new
  its good on its own but i cant still believe that what happened to the 2 unicorn units its a fucking bummer     also what exactly happened to their reactors anyway
  apparently the big shockwave the unicorn sent caused them to be disassembled like theyd never even been built some timey wimey stuff
  also what exactly happened to their reactors anyway  localized time travel aoe magic casted on the reactors reverting them to before the reactors were assembled in the factory    imagine magicking someone out of existence by turning the clock back on them and in the place where they were standing its now just a single sperm cell and egg on the floor
  imagine magicking someone out of existence by turning the clock back on them and in the place where they were standing its now just a single sperm cell and egg on the floor  i wish i could do that to myself
  zeon starting yet another revolution to save more spacenoids and earthnoids alike from the suffering of living

  is phenex the most powerful out of the 3
  from memory phenex was meant to be the equal of banshee which was slightly improved over the unicorn
  am i missing something or does this really sound incredibly retarded unless they wanted to control her by her becoming a cyber nt the whole process doesnt make sense
    hes just continuing the pattern tomino started in zeta/zz
    i always thought it was just the unicorn sending out an emp wave
  enhancing a natural newtype into cyber newtype is uncommon but still possible    iirc theres dialogue in cca that suggests that quess may have undergone some procedure to become enhanced
is banana dead
  id make more sense if we had a better idea how the cyber newtype process worked and how far the enhancing goes it doesnt help that the way the titans did it and zeon seem to be completely different
  no he shows up in nt
  got shaved bald  short haired girls are cuter than long haired girls so they improved her there
  real nt   except she wasnt michelle was the real nt
  is it just that silver bullet shot from the trailer or does he do anything else is he affiliated to the federation or zeon
whats happening to uc
  that was implied in the novel in the movie rita is at least implied to have been the newtype of the 3
  it went out of hand vecause daddy tomino doesnt look after it anymore
  nt voodoo took over
  millennial marketing
  feddies  it was the titans      why not ask in the actual spoiler thread retard
    considering time travel is now a thing it could just be the actual phenex
  i cant still believe that what happened to the 2 unicorn units  anon in another thread said that its revealed that the unicorn is still intact jsut coverd up by some tape and theres a scene with minerva looking at it 
  they literally said they rebuilt it from the rose of hermes blueprints
  fukui has literally fucked it over by adding his retarded fanfic shit into it    this is really tominos fault though  he was too ambiguous with his initial use of psychoframe in cca and because of his obtuse writing style people who watch his stuff get lost on the details  so they watch cca and come up with shit like unicorn
  this is pretty par for the course for everything from zeta onwards in the timeline
  no it is the best way to connect gundam with ideon with the technology explaination it can explain how to build  they even use ideon swords sound effect in nt for a certain beam shooting scene
  its only logical
how many action scenes are in this if we have at least four its already better than iron menstruation
  w2c
  
  nt a vs phenex  dijehs vs feds  zeta vs asshimar  nt b vs sinanju stein  nt b vs phenex  nt b in neo zeong vs phenex  neo zeong vs feds  nt c vs neo zeong  phenex vs neo zeong  silver bullet vs neo zeong  true phenex vs neo zeong
  thats a lot of neo zeong
  the original source material is literally just phenex and a jegan fighting a neo zeong with a psycho doga in it so yeah the phenex and neo zeong have the most screentime
  newtypes
  nt b in neo zheong  wat
  basically its blue destiny
  id wear those i also have an idea on how to increase their sales rate the trick is to use double layer material unicorn mode pattern and the psychoframe under that heres when the fun starts unicorn mode material should be thin enough  but not see through normally when a guy gets a boner the part around his waist stretches and its blue material with writings gets revealed lower part should be sewn in a way that would look like fron skirt a and crotch armor opens up revealing psychoframe rate my idea
  zeta
rita jonah and michelle better be aussie when the dub rolls by or else
  this pic physically disgusts me and i fear a total disconnect from modern media
  zeta  like the zeta gundam or a zeta plus
  but ideon is a prequel to gundam
  that you wrote this out when others only thought about it earned you one hundred internet points
    ideon punish himself for destroying the previous universe by reincarnating in countless ill fated gm in the new universe
    flashback from the battle at dakar so its the real thing
  thats not tominos fault given that cca is an obvious conclusion to the story and didnt demand sequels like unicorn or nt to begin with
  psychoframe is fucking smalltime compared to the original script that had char beaten by a newtype embryo
  its a story thats not allowed to end
  nutypes
  i wish we could do that fukui at this point  muh space magick  muh actual time travel emp    what a fucking hack
      calm down you zudahs spoiler anons mentioned that the unicorn units despite their magic trickery cant bring dead people back or outright cease people from existing for all we know the reverting time bit was a figure of speech and the unicorn just has extensive telepathic powers that can block or disassemble things to the smallest particle
  its still dumb as fuck i thought zz and cca took the space magic shit too far but this and unicorn are just flat out retarded with it
  i do like that it shows how freaked out people are about it and thus why its going to stop being used come late uc somebody with common sense finally said stop making psychoframe before we erase reality and anaheim listened
  wasnt jupiter its own thing  and anyway zeonism is the neoconfederacy shit of uc feddies did reconstruction horribly so it never really died
  when feds and zeeks are both willing to cooperate on deep sixing the rx0 machines you know shits gone too far for psycoframe technology
  char beaten by a newtype embryo  its been years since i heard this one gave me a chuckle  was it nanais or beltorchikas
how do you feel about banana coming to the rescue
  amuro and beltorchikas unborn child saves amuro from char by making kill shots char has fired at him disappear into nothingness with its newtype powers
        there are slight parallels
  its okay wouldnt be the first time an exprotagonist shows up in a later entry hope he fucks off for hathaways flash though he can come back in uc2
  muh feddies were just as bad  whooooa time travel  newtype energy is pretty much just ki or chakra or whatever bullshit from your favorite shounen now and can be wielded freely     fukui is actually the worst thing to happen to this franchise i literally cant believe this garbage
  thinking zz cca and unicorn went too far with space magic    forgetting angel halo was a thing    youre that shitposter who pretends to know what hes talking about arent you
  i hope he shows up so hathaway can kill him and redeem himself
  frying peoples brains is the least retarded thing from any of them one of the first abilities newtypes had was to exert their presence on each other and possibly even normals like bright it evolved in zeta where powerful nts like haman and scirocco could outright use pressure to disorient other people
zoltan literally massacres civilians for fun what the fuck more you need for gundam to not be zeonwank
  fukui is actually the worst thing to happen to this franchise i literally cant believe this garbage  what about gundam age build fighters build divers seed destiny ibo and greco
  every time i hear about him he just gets more over the top evil and i get more excited
  i like four out of those six shows you list
  literally all of them were no where near as bad as this this is space psychics can turn you back into an embryo faggot levels of retard its like the cheapest italian bhorror garbage
  you must either be mentally handicapped or 12 then
  modern english anime dubs  accents  sorry anon every dub nowadays is just the same funimation vas we dont even get canadian dubs anymore
  i actually have tastes and judgement some people might define as superb
  i pray you never read dune
  on one hand this is just another excuse for look at how eeeviiilll the feddies are    on the other hand the existence of a nt born on earth who manifested her powers without ever setting foot in space pretty much shits on zeons only us unbound by gravity spacenoid ubermensh can be newtypes ideology
  zeons have to rape rita until she bites her tongue off or admit that the circumstances of kiki rositas death were falsified as an act of propaganda
  so after pajeet fucking strayans can be newtypes  so much for muh gravity free soul
    you have shit taste you mouth breathing pleb
  i thought zz and cca took the space magic shit too far  bad taste anon
  premises are never the problem a show only has to be consistent to some degree if a show transitions too hard and too fast people get pissed hence why jumping the shark is derogatory even though its really just describing a sudden turn of events that changes the tone setting etc of a show or franchise
  theres a flashback taking place during chars dakar speech that has new footage of zeta fucking up an asshimar
  feddies  its the fuckig titans you retard
  did you forget when amuro literally pushed an asteroid out of earths orbit using his newtype powers or when judau went super saiyan newtype and exerted so much power it scared haman or when kamilles zeta gundam got powered up by dead peoples souls and killed scirocco or when the neo zeong warped reality and showed banagher the past and the end of the universe     seems pretty consistent to me disabling some mobile suits by reverting the generators back in time is crossing the line though shut the fuck up
how does neo zeong get destroyed
  disabling some mobile suits by reverting the generators back in time is crossing the line though  all of the above instances you mention sans unicorn have obvious thematic purpose that directly capitalize on the whole function of newtypes in the story perhaps the reactor stuff in nt is more similar to that than people are thinking but the skepticism is i think fair its not just a matter of disbelief suspension     the psychoframe/newtype shenanigans in unicorn and nt probably are the least of its problems though i think its just a shitty redundant story
  just got back from the theater banagher comes out of nowhere and slaps it with his dick so hard that it gets sent to another timeline
  phenex uses hokuto ujoken to cut it up into bits before punching through the sinanjus cockpit
well the japanese feedback is coming back and its overwhelmingly positive
  wut  he wrecks neo zeong with a silver bullet
  dumbfuck
    itd be more believable if banana telepathically/pushed his presence onto the federal forces to make them stop in their tracks
  amuro himself returns from beyond the time and hijacks the phenex rita begs him to take her then and there but amuro just slaps her and cries about lalah while the thing explodes in the background
  i just wanted to see this now 
  sore demo
  thats sad i was hoping for mquve to get control of phenex
  thats literally what happens retard
in the universal centrury year uc107 bahama jesus rinkusu finds himself piloting the perfectibility ultrima deux ex meta unicorn maximus typeaaaa against the necro titans who using the secret technology of the neo neo neo neo zeon best known as neo neo sleeves are taking the earth hostage by using psycoframe technology to make the moon drop on earth however jesus rinkusu uses his gundams psycoframe technology to revert the ii neo baund docs psycoframe back in time but fails to take note that by doing so he mass produces the psyco gundam mk7 thus to combat them he uses his gundams psycoframe to summon the gundam protags of all other gundam series to fight against this menace then imprisons the president of this new incarnations of titans inside the psycoframe of his gundam then goes beyond the time and loops himself outside of uc thus making psycoframe unavailable to uc except for the time when uc will need it again and that is when he will return with his gundam to assist humanity again with his allmighty psycoframe so that justice could prevail the end
  yep i know  i mean i cant watch the movie here i just wanted to see it geez calm down
  honestly i think the localized time inversion helps to give credence to the idea that people would be creeped out enough to finally stop pushing the limits of newtype superscience down that path lies some really unsettling stuff of which time inversion is surely just the tip of the physicsexploiting iceberg of well you have a nigh infinite energy source how many corner cases to special relativity can you come up with in the beyond time
  seething
so is rita just a brain in a jar or does she still have a body is she surgically attached to the gundam
  curious about it too
  through twitter or something i havent started trawling for impressions yet
do we get to see punished banana imagine going through all that in the laplace incident for things to still end like this him and his unicorn the boogeymen of society
  autism the post
  flip side princess puss must be nice riddhe got fucking nothing
  this gundam protagonist won at life  too bad he couldnt get marida too
  riddhe got fucking nothing  good
  punished banana  he only makes a small appearance to save jona the and from the little bit of what we hear from mineva in the novel he seems to be just fine having mineva as his gf probably made the entire laplace incident worth it
  hes the one piloting this unsurprisingly
  riddhe didnt even get death unfortunately
  huh i was wondering where the magnum suddenly came from
  a small price to pay to literally become gundam id go through a lot worse than she did if i could actually be a gundam
  setsuna is seething at rita for becoming a literal gundam instead of elsing like him
  boards too including places like futabas robot anime board which is traditionally very critical of stuff    every single positive impression starts off with the character designs are atrocious but though man those designs are bad
sleeves remnants    were officially at neo neo zeon remnant remnants now
  he shoots one of the neo zeongs arms with the beam magnum the recoil destroys the silver bullets arm but his silver bullet has extra replacement spare arms on the back specifically for this then just dicks around until the end to pick up jona after the phenex fucks off
loses both his waifus in the same movie  damn to make matters worse banana comes in to save his sorry ass and just happily goes back to fucking his princess pussy while jona is probably a broken man by the end
  is there any geara zulu action
    threads actually from way before the movie started airing and people were really skeptical but all the recent posts about it have been positive aside from complaining about the character designs and the hathaways flash trailer not showing in certain cinemas
    i watched it without reading the books it wasnt bad the character designs and usage of songs was weird but i have no qualms aside from that but wow fukui was serious in his interviews about psychoframe being ideonite    maybe its because i had low expectations but i enjoyed it far more than expected it does feel like a smallerscale unicorn but at the same time putting everything into occult stuff makes it feel like they finally managed to put together what they really wanted to show    some complaining about the hathaways flash trailer not being shown in some cinemas    it felt like an ending to the gundam unicorn series with lots of homages to previous series with the reused footage the occult elements felt like they went back to z/zz the ii neo zeong felt more like a final boss than in unicorn which was cool    isnt it more like a prologue to a sequel than an ending theres so much foreshadowing like the location of the unicorn    its amazing how people are praising it so much after the total silence from before it aired
this is how we get black history turn a
      aside from the unstable sakuga and overuse of the theme song im satisfied    the mecha sakuga was really good the character sakuga really pulled it down    i watched the first 23 minute video and it didnt get me first 10 minutes of unicorn heart catched my precure    the characters look terrible from the design to begin with i agree with the overuse of songs i was otherwise satisfied the phenex was unexpectedly cool i dont get the setting of how the neo zeong is filled with unknown technology made by frontal chars ghost though what is the logic in him being able to make something like that just because hes char
    how do moons feel about the linkin park guy
    袖付きのキモいパンク男とかウェイストランドの雑魚かよ  このキャラデザは二度と宇宙世紀ガンダムに関わるないで欲しい鉄血かageならありかもだが    the sleeves creepy punk guy is so bad what is he a grunt enemy from fallout  i dont want this character designer to ever have anything to do with uc gundam again he might be okay in ibo or age though
  this ones from the 2chan movie board thread which is also an older thread and mostly just crazy racists screaming about koreans for the entire past month up till the last few posts from after the movie was released    
  fallout  dude he wouldnt even pass as a wasteland raider
  crazy racists are truly the universal constants of messageboards
  im sure ill hate it then
the soundtrack album has a bunch of remixes of unicorns main themes do those play in narrative or is it just kind of a bonus track
    that colony drop    thanks anon i needed that
  wouldnt call it a masterpiece but at least it was less of a blight on the franchise than ibo or age  its like im really on /m/
  i want to add that 2chans movie board is populated by 90 actual crazy people they shitpost all day about nonracist retarded shit as well  the mc is korean why  because the character designer is korean  screw this  its because the chinese and koreans like gundam because of transformers and pacific rim  those are korean hair styles  ive watched all the gundam movies but im starting to get sick of it  why a korean designer to sell it to asia japan would hate it anime otaku dont get along with korea  you mean dumbasses dont get along with korea  nah dumbasses love korea who do you think listen to kpop  is that guy above suggesting that kou uraki has a korean hair style  its korean im skipping it ive watched all gundam series and was looking forward to a sequel to unicorn but i hate that country  is nt short for ntr  you losers have gotten old and stingy and just complain without spending any money so of course japan isnt a relevant market anymore  these characters would look appropriate for a series like tiramisu
  its like im holding my mouth up to an anus and breathing in deeply
  these characters would look appropriate for a series like tiramisu  its funny cuz its true
  have a gold gundam have a director named kim gold in korean not bad bandai namco  i wish they made a unicorn sequel with the same staff designers included  the phenex doesnt look gold  character designers korean characters name sounds korean characters hair looks korean that main characters a korean i want him to have nothing to do with older characters and ms  this is a movie   the character designs look like theyre aiming for teens is that a reason why theyre using korean staff i feel like the youngest people interested in uc would be at least in their 30s is it bad marketing research  uc was popular with 2030s and chinese so theyre making it for them said fukui  i watched it it was good aside from the character designs  how is the sakuga for a movie worse than that of an ova i watched the youtube video and it made me throw up goodbye nt  how much time and money did they have to make this it looked pretty bad  same director as twilight axis guess he likes flashbacks  character designs were bad but sakuga was fine mecha sakuga was decent though the action wasnt as good as unicorns story was decent i didnt expect much so it was better than i thought its not a masterpiece but its not an insult to the gundam name like ibo or destiny or age
    those fucking tails suck as one of the worst redesigns in gundam
  
  fuck you the tails are the best part of phenexs design
  its not a masterpiece but its not an insult to the gundam name like ibo or destiny or age
  did you forget when amuro literally pushed an asteroid out of earths orbit using his newtype powers    no i dont i remember him goign what and riding his horse like a gay stripper while char was talking about lalah being his mom its pretty clear it was the residents of earth as a whole that enabled the axis event tomino even goes out of his way to give his leads embarrassing distracted deaths and a heavy handed ending showing scenes from across the earth watching the lights of axis kys you underage mongoloid you must have a peasized brain to not get obvious imagery thats borderline bad in how unsubtle it is in the context of the rest of the movie and fight with amuro going on about human potential    time reversing rainbow shockwaves is fucking obscene and doesnt even have any purpose beyond special chosen one shit     judau went super saiyan newtype and exerted so much power it scared haman  wow scaring people is just like turning back time you sure showed me    kamilles zeta gundam got powered up by dead peoples souls and killed scirocco  by creating a beam barrier around the zeta to protect him while it crashed into the o yeah good to know that telekinesis also gives you the power to rend time apart like its your bitch and travel through dimensions i always thought it just meant creating force with your mind    or when the neo zeong warped reality and showed banagher the past and the end of the universe  unicorns the start of all these problems because nt is confirming all that time bullshit from unicorn was fucking real and fukuis at the heart of this bullshit     its a huge fucking leap to go from i can push shit with my mind to haha time is my bitch and fuck this dimension im outta here its like superman going from leaping buildings to superboy punching reality apart
  whats this also imagine being the pilot and heir to the unicorn and end up piloting this
  to summon the gundam protags of all other gundam series to fight against this menace  considering what the promos were for the 40th anniversary project im not even going to laugh at this its probably going to be unicorn dimension hopping to gather mcs to save the multiverse or some shit
  i wouldnt mind gundam decade
   mc is korean why    australians are korean  i never knew australia was a korean prison colony
  its a silver bullet theyre moderately cool
  remember that weird white gundam that fought for a bit against the og nz in unicorn
bananna styling with dat silver bullet    lol  the mc is outshone in his own story
  their racists are as smart as ours apparently
  styling  he shoots the beam magnum once which breaks the things arm
    its like a slightly better written johnny spaceboots story
   dont want this character designer to ever have anything to do with uc gundam again     he might be okay in ibo or age though
  uc is srs bsns
  why did they make an animator/animation director a character designer and project director is sunrise high
  that would be fucking rad
  turn a prequel a gogo
  its not a masterpiece but its not an insult to the gundam name like ibo or destiny or age  good enough for me
  first 10 minutes of unicorn heart catched my precure
  we could be fucking anything at this point given how much of a melting pot this place is
  im confused doesnt sakuga mean good animation if youre criticizing animation for being shitty then its not sakuga right
  is nt short for ntr
  literal meaning of sakuga is animation
  sakuga just means animation when used by japanese people it being used as the word for good animation is a western term
  same reason why you call cartoons anime
  its like a slang term for really gorgeous cuts of animation mostly done by singular animators
  this better be called the black bullet
  sunrise not bandai get your shit straight
what are the zeon suits around 850 with the gelgoog swords  shields
man they really fucking hate koreans i mean i arledy knew they did but wew
  dijeh arent they
      dijeh yeah its a zeta era high performance mobile suit amuro piloted one
  east asia has been one concentrated triangle circlejerk of hate since forever you know
  ohhh
  sakuga is individual quality of frames but retarded americans misuse it
  kinda how asshats keep saying sakuga like its untranslatable
  i guess individual quality of frames is too many words for retards to wrap their brains around
  kims not the director thats just stupid people being stupid
  just whatever twitter comments i can find from searching ガンダムnt    it was good    it was so good i felt bad for expecting it to be less its a bridge between the way of newtypes and the gundam world that comes after good job fukui its both a sequel to unicorn and its own thing    it was all fights and great for it it is episodic like unicorn    oh its a single movie i though it would be bandai visuals usual bit by bit theatrical screenings    i wanted to watch gundam nt as ueno toho but its full i guess gundam is still popular    i didnt get it but it was good    i watched it i didnt understand the story but the music and phenex were cool    gundam nt netorare    it was the best really im going to rewatch unicorn again and then nt again    spoiler protagonist uses incoms mustwatch for incom fans    i watched gundam nt it was filled with adults    i hate gundam nt same for unicorn i hate fukuis involvement in gundam    it was a gundam that was kind of like what is a newtype    the gundam nt merchandise was all sold out even though it just opened yesterday    the gundams move a lot and are really cool but the jestas were cooler
  i hate gundam nt same for unicorn i hate fukuis involvement in gundam    oh glad to see /m/ has some japanese users
  the battle scenes were good and more importantly the neo zeong moved more than it did in unicorn    the phenex was cooler than i expected    nt was great i wanted to buy the pamphlet but both the regular and special editions were sold out its only the second day thats unbelievable    i wanted to watch gundam nt but all the seats were full    i watched nt i want a dijeh    you have to watch z cca and unicorn before nt especially unicorn    gundam nts mecha were super cool    my thoughts on nt narrative was cool phenex was cool phenex was coolphenex was cool     some guy who put gundam nt in his username complaining about gundam seed sucking     nt was amazing i wonder how that stuff wil work in exvs    i thought gundam nt would be empty but it was filled with middleaged people i figured i wouldnt like it because its a unicorn sequel and as expected fukuis gundam was too occult for me especially the last fight    i watched nt i thought i was going to be watching gundam but it turned out to be a fantasy movie    why are the childrens voice actors so bad
  i watched nt i thought i was going to be watching gundam but it turned out to be a fantasy movie  while i was expecting this to happen this is the exact same reaction i felt when i watched the film i give it a fukui/10 surprisingly competant
  anything over that would be kiraing and people wouldnt want that honestly pic related has become more relevant by the years theyre shoving unicorn into the frontseat of uc
  so unicorn got the eva01 treatment
  uncoincidentally i dislike bahnaji for the same reasons i dislike kira yamato
    how much rape is in it
  its like asian /tv/ minus the bane and sneedposting
  the gundams move a lot and are really cool but the jestas were cooler  based
so is the nt obvious core block a obvious core fighter if so is it seen undocked curious if its 0079 era frame updated something even more improved over gp01
  based incom chads
  human rape not as much as youre likely expecting
      there was a fantheory that psychoframe just allowed for direct minovsky particle manipulation by humans that tried to gain traction on /m/    basically it explains events surrounding psychoframes like this  axis push was essentially a huge minovsky craft strong enough to push something that large    unicorn and banshee saving magallanica was a beam shield or a similar structure created by hyper condensing minovsky particles    there was some other stuff too but i forgot what it was youd have to look into archives for that
  super smash gundam  id be down
  the recoil destroys the silver bullets arm  oh yeah i forgot the unicorns bm was super powerful  same thing happened to riddhes delta plus
  /m/ btfo again unicron stronk
  was feds antagonized by tomino as inhumane
meet me at the movie
  t barren cave
  i get chinese  japanese but why korean  japanese
  korea blames japan for everything and acts like a victim despite being on the same side in ww2 and being guilty of tons of war crimes that they claim the japanese did and a lot of japanese dont like how they keep doing that
  so basically russia and ukraine but on the other side of the globe
  reminds me how in fgo there was an event that takes place in 1945 and koreans all over twitter instantly started demanding japan apologize for the hate and other ww2 shit that japan apparently did to korea then the event finally happens and there was nothing to do with anything besides the date and suddenly everyone of them pretended they didnt all sperged and jumped to conclusions this shit will always confuse me a thousand years can go by and koreans will still hate the japanese for ww2 shit

  dumb redditposter
  holocaust 911
  arent them all in the east
  gooks have hated nips since long before that ww2 shit is just an excuse because its recent and still kind of relevant
  koreans hating japan for ww2 shit    you mean joining the japanese army in raping/pillaging their way across asia    fuck korea at least japan had the decency to apologize/pay reparations for their war crimes korea is just as guilty but the cunts just whine all day pretending to be victims
  fuck off abe
  retard
  shut up and be a family man otaku scum
  worse its actually like peronism
  yeah if theres something worse than untralatable fags its faggots who expect every word to have a 11 counterpart i feel schadenfreude when i see them bitching
    the feds in zeta created the concept of cyber newtypes by mentally fucking with subjects and them using those emotionally damaged individuals as soldiers so if its bad in nt its bad in zeta
  the recoil destroys the silver bullets arm but his silver bullet has extra replacement spare arms on the back specifically for this    holy shit its easier to make a fuckton of replaceable arms than to reinforce arm/shoulder joints
  translating language is like decoding a cypher you just swap the words out for the right ones and its done 
  or mounting it to a recoil dampening brace that either locks into the shoulder or a swivel able arm that connects to the back and wraps over the shoulder
  i like that they didnt forget about this from episode 4 of the ova when the delta plus fired the beam magnum
how have you guys even watched the movie already
  only two anons have watched it and one doesnt speak japanese  everyone else just read the novel spoiler
    wasnt there some advanced screening in the us last week
  they showed the first 25 minutes which you can also watch on their channel right now
  zeon did the same so dont give me that bullshit
  lmao eva reference  you gotta bekidding me  literally a reference to the original nu gundam when it was revealed
  i feel like the youngest people interested in uc would be at least in their 30s
  thats from mechatalk which may have gotten it from japanese imageboards its been around for ages longer than unicorn and honestly a better idea than just letting nts be actual gods    iirc it was around at least as far back as when the unicorn novels were coming out and the godcorns reverse time power was theorized to just be stopping the minovsky reaction of the generators
  fuck korea at least japan had the decency to apologize/pay reparations for their war crimes korea is just as guilty but the cunts just whine all day pretending to be victims  are you a vietcong /a/ used to have some retarded seamonkey who spergs out if a webtoon is so much as mentioned and he would watch every single thread
  a small subset of feds also the flannagan institution was a former zeon institution taken over by the feds like the nazi scientists the us took in
  the quality  hahahaha
  first 10 minutes of unicorn heart catched my precure  haaaaaaaaaaaaa
  you got blacked
    a subset is still part of the set its not like every single feddie is holding down the character in nt to help cut her open tomino started the concept so acting like fukui is tarnishing the federation by doing something tomino himself has done is just silly
  i thought that too but fukui is a retard but then so was i for watching unicorn and expecting it to be good
  no more brad swaile in gundam shows  kinda sad desu i grew up with him as the amuro dub voice
  gundam nt netorare
  funimation  funi doesnt even dub gundam its a mix of californian and ex4kids actors
  pretty much  
  beam magnum is just that strong
  whats this ntr meme about
  nt  ntd  ntr
  ntdestoyer  actually used to find newtypes  ntrevival/rebuild/resomething  actually destroys newtypes
  retard
    there is not the one line that implies she might be is just ambiguously worded but the more important thing is that cyber newtypes in japanese arent called newtypes at all and instead the phrase is more like modified human which quess is never referred to as by anyone not nanai not char not gyunei not hathaway not amuro not anyone gyunei is though all of them only call quess a newtype so while they considered modifying her the ambiguous phrase clarifies that they didnt need to since she could already use funnels
   gundams move a lot and are really cool but the jestas were cooler  the jestas were cooler  this nigger gets it
      nt gundam doesnt even cover up its core fighter    how lewd
      t fukui      how many dijehs are they planning to shit out product placement is one thing but this just looks retarded and took away from the whole amuros gelgoog identity also why would they have the gustav karl jobbing like this at least the anshka managed to do soem fighting
    i still think the biosensors ability to use the souls of the dead as a power up to make something invincible or freeze enemies is the silliest thing a psycommu derived system has done honestly it kind of works in show but its still weird
  not anymore with nt now time can be literally turned back with newtype hadouken
  unicornfags are npcs
  the story might be meh but i gotta say sunrise can still put out some good looking animation
  nah time reversal no jutsu has nothing on psychic lobotomies
is there yuri in nt
  what an ugly gremlin christ
    no i was counting that too using souls as a power up is weirder than time travel to me
  never disrespect a ghost waifu
  the hair actually looks a bit like setsuna
  do you think the scientists had fun with her body after removing her brain
    frying peoples brain is physically possible now so is messing with brain through electromagnetic radiation or interference with brainwaves time reversal is physically impossible
    im sorry how is frying peoples brains remotely similar to using actual confirmed literal souls as a powerup if its only about connecting slightly similar realistic things them time reversal is possible on a quantum level         this phenomenon seems to reverse the arrow of time the idea that natural processes run forward but not in reverse
  literally not what the aritcle is about  seemingly reversing thermodynamic laws isnt really the same as actual time reversal just as quanutm entanglement is not the same as teleportation wierd shit always happen on the quantum level  having souls ie patterns of brain waves linger in devices that are supposed to capture  process and then output them seems more realistic to me
  thats a really loose interpretation of soul in the classic sense then    but it does then mean pulsars have souls so im ok with it
why are her ears so huge they suppose to represent the phenexs vfin like how it has her twintails
  show me one eeg that looks the radio output of a pulsar faggot
    i know its not what the article is about thats why i said it was only slightly similar as in brainwaves are only slightly similar to an actual soul saying its just brainwaves dismisses the common conception of a soul for a scientific one that suits your purpose which is what i was deliberately doing despite knowing and even admitting it was bullshit that you find it less weird does not mean im required to agree just like youre not required to agree with my assessment that doesnt make my opinion any less valid though because it is in my opinion just fucking weird that dead people can speak interact and act as actual powerups for technology not just be recorded or even live within but actively improve just by their presence
  time reversal is physically impossible    at a theoretical level its physically permissible under some very weird circumstances within the bounds of gr from what i understand
    the same thing that happened to doctor who then star trek lately star wars in short rebranding for new generations to milk money from
  the main uc demographic in japan is pretty old though like watched zeta on tv old
    uh more really good material is being made     yeah what a shame
    maybe they will do a soft reboot after unicorn 2 but for now they are still coasting on nostalgia
    wormholes are theoretically capable of permitting time travel which is why space operas have such a boner for using them not that we have any idea of whether its true or not since we barely understand them and are never likely to be close enough to one to experiment and test the hypothesis we wouldnt even know how to at least as of now if we did get close enough either given that the salient point of wormholes is that they take in matter and energy but dont output any that we know of    its still technically possible though because of the way spacetime is warped so heavily by the presence of a wormhole so that all normal laws of physics break down within them it theoretically allows for something to go faster than light besides spacetime itself which we know does given the rate of expansion of spacetime and possibly to freely travel through time backwards or forwards maybe not though who knows    i mean if it was then where are all the time travellers the fact there arent millions of time travel tourists at important events is a theoretical paradox/conundrum often used to prove that at least we humans will never work it out since if it were then itd eventually become efficient practical safe and convenient enough for more than highly specialized scientists to do it but weve seen no evidence of it so far then again maybe theyre just that good at blending in or maybe existence has built in failsafes against a paradox that prevents it from happening in some way so we never could detect them even if it were possible time travels weird yo
  isnt it amuros core fighter
  the dijeh is used by luo and co which supported aeug in z
is the phenex the first instance in gundam where weve seen a fully sentient ms
  alice and exam are a thing
  its not really a sentient ms its an ms possessed by a true nt
  alice was only implied and exam wasnt sentient it was the nt girl in the test tube remotely taking unconscious control over it when exam went out of control rita or whatevers soul actually resides inside phenex
so the psycoframe is a small scale moonlight butterfly now
  i mean moonlight butterfly is nanomachines powerful destructive but ultimately just some tech     psychoframe literally operates beyond what we know of as reality
  unicorn and banshee saving magallanica was a beam shield or a similar structure created by hyper condensing minovsky particles    i am pretty sure fukui even said that in an interview     most of the newtype magics were always about controlling minovsky particles and pretty much reactor/systems hacks
    i mean psycoframes are just machines too theyre literally made of miniaturized computers according to chars counterattack their operation is mysterious and their apparent ceiling of effect so great as to be scary to us and the denizens of their setting but much of our contemporary tech would make someone from ancient civilizations piss themselves and shatter their world view too    the fact everyone seems content to just give up on understanding the technology and walk away from it despite the obvious good it could do simply because of the bad is perhaps the most annoying part of psycoframes
    unicornfags will call this post autism but its likely the future
  you know how normally we cant hit the speed of light because the way the math works out itd require infinite energy to move an infinitely massive object at such speed    psycoframe is like the kind of material that comes real close to satisfying the infinite energy bit and allowing for the laws of physics to shit themselves in incredibly interesting ways     free energy drawn from the emotions of humans let alone highly emotional teenage pilots thrust into combat during some crucial years of their lives is some crazy ass shit
  fuck korea at least japan had the decency to apologize/pay reparations for their war crimes  they didnt do shit thats why most of asia hates japan
  the potential for bad is always greater than the potential for good and all those corps are so corrupt in the uc its honestly for the best that its abandoned
  nothing of the previous examples are on the level of literal reality warping like the unicorn bullshit suits does    zeta pretty much simply busted the os controls by affecting its own biosensor judau merely scared people but didnt go beyond that no different to the killing intent trope of shonen anime    and amuro fucking died trying to stop a colony with the scene making it blatantly obvious it was the will of mankind on its whole what prevented the disaster
  amuro died  wheres the body then
  and amuro fucking died trying to stop a colony with the scene making it blatantly obvious it was the will of mankind on its whole what prevented the disaster    given what we know now i would rather think that both char and amuro have transcended humanity and became true newtypes hence why the t psycoframe resonates and pushes axis back
  considering all the other suits exploded trying to push axis one can perfectly assume the same happened to the nu gundam that and if he somehow survived that the overwhelming pressure of being used to channel the will of mankind or the willpower force that pushed axis mustve done it either way squishing him and anything between axis and the planet level psychofield or whatever it was that miracle
  except thailand
    and yet we still have nuclear derived technology doing plenty of good every day
     amuro fucking died trying to stop a colony with the scene making it blatantly obvious it was the will of mankind on its whole what prevented the disaster    bull fucking shit char obviously doesnt want it given his dialogue the camera cuts back to the bridge of the rewloola at least once during the events of the axis push to show nanai and others upset about whats happening and again after axis has started moving away from earth and were also shown multiple people on earth watching the light of axis moving away while they go about normal lives with no idea whats happened in what way do you think that suggests its the will of all mankind
  well then around 9999999 of mankind wanted it give or take if just one or two guys not wanting it rustles your jimmies
     multiple scenes established that most people on earth has no idea what was happening   literally not a single scene establishing that even one person at any sure the moon mars or jupiter jad any idea what was happening   only a few guys didnt know    only about 000000000000001 of humanity knew or wanted it if anything not didnt know
machines powered by feelings to think id wondered how gundams kept getting shoved into the super robot wars games
  cca the movie obfuscates it but other versions of cca are less ambiguous about the fact that amuro and char simply ceased to exist    like it or not nt is making that even more clear that becoming a true newtype is moving beyond the physical
  its supposed to be a prototype ground mobile suit based on the rick dias now its everywhere in moon gundam msvr and still being used in late uc 90s for some reason when better performing ms are easier to find barring product placement armor
  unicorn makes it clear that chars body at least just straight up vanished because they recovered the sazabis cockpit and used its psychoframe to make full frontal
  got shaved bald  she also requested to fuck a mobile suit
the next episode preview starts with ore wa tenkuji takeru
shit show  slow sub  ghost soon  fitting
that glimpse of decade as hibiki  hibiki arc when
this show is really shit they get back gaim and what does he do drop some fucking oranges fuck off what nip retard thought this was a good idea
  he was behind a lot of the episodes plot by sending sogo to the past and even pushed the development of several characters    stripping them of their rider powers was still dumb though its clear that here for example they only had kouta for two takes  the scenes in front of the store and the god kouta set  but if they still had powers and appeared as riders they could just have a suit actor appearing in other scenes and koutas actor dubbing that later    what nip retard thought this was a good idea  probably shirakura since he wouldnt have to actually shoot or write it i wouldnt be surprised if the writer talking about how staying in a single format was a bad idea and how theyd need to change things up later was just a way to convince shirakura to drop this set up after a while
once again decade comes back to save the shitshow that is ghost
i liked it
  they really need scenes of the riders being heroic even if they have no powers i know a few did that but all of them should do that
he cant over quartzer
lets see how many oofs they gonna sub
why the fuck god kouta suddenly appear and not disappear instantly when future sougo defeated another gaim
  i think the implication is that he was holding back the effects there were glitchy effects when he appeared even last episode then this week after he saw the timeline was changed everything suddenly expanded and he disappeared
i dunno why but this is cute
this was definitely the best arc of zio so far goofs involving the two sougos were fun and that fight scene was kino gaim actors felt really underutilised though
this will make a good image
  this too    holy shit this ep is a goldmine
wat
woz forever rotting in cuck hell
    
  look there wasnt much of a choice there unless you wanted words all over sougos face too
  shit why didnt we get geiz as the sulky tsundere heroine that hates the waga maou
  is he not already
  that was him before getting his ass kicked in ooo arc
woz intentionally messes with the events with things then explains that its all part of maintaining the proper path to sougo becoming an overlord which also implies that them being with him the way they are is also right and proper    tsukiyomi and geiz are really some dumb ass characters
  nah its more of a common storytelling thing besides so far the only thing theyve been doing is fighting time jacker shit
was this scene kino
  pretty kino as fuck
  the entire split screen battle was absolutely kino especially with the woz cutin
  sasuga kami
  this gas effect on the floor was very common in the 80s i wonder when they stopped doing it
    because modern series and movie producers have mostly lost sight of what made the 80s action flick great
  of what made the 80s action flick great  whats that if you dont mind me asking
  practical effects life threatening stunts and a casual disregard of what parents might think when little hiro tunes in every sunday morning to watch a karate bugman murder the shit out of a cult one member at a time
  practical effects being the immediate answer for a special effect instead of cg while cg in theory can be futureproofed for things like stock footage you cant exactly deny the advantage of there being an actual real prop to interact with
tsukiyomi has no sense of personal space this arc
  its refreshing compared to all the times shes just standing awkwardly to the sides and watching sougo and geizs homoerotic collar grabbings whispering into each others ears and looking deeply into each others eyes all the time
i hope three days later sougo comes back in a later episode still wearing that label on his shirt
i dont know how anyone can call this show shit anymore even despite with the weak cameos the cast has quickly turned out to be fun the soundtrack is neato and now theyre getting godtier directors for these episodes now were getting decade shenanigans next week too
im impressed with how seamlessly this all looks the only thing that looked really off was when sougo was hiding behind sougo talking to everyone while ducking behind himself that looked incredibly greenscreen compared to the rest of this stuff
  i want tsukuyomi to get pushy with me
sound  
sound  
  yeah the audio was the biggest giveaway that there wasnt two of them actually there
sound  
sound  
idk guys im loving this fucking series
sound        its been getting better the longer it goes on and the dynamic between sougo geiz tskuyomi and woz is getting better and better honestly my only gripes are how short the cameos are or how insignificant they feel relative to how much the zio crew is and yes i understand its their show and how it feels like they keep showing like 3 of the same transformation per episode i feel like the transformations are padded out a bit more than usual and thats ignoring woz announcing things
  my only gripes are how short the cameos are or how insignificant they feel  i mean most of these characters have their own series with 2550 episodes with their faces in them im okay with just having a glimpse of what they would be doing if they never became riders this is sougos series
  it would actually be hilarious if tsukuyomi falls for sougo and we cut back to 2068 and we see older future tsukuyomi ruling alongside oma zio geiz would seethe so hard hed burn hotter than crossz magma
sound        i get it it just feels like if youre going to go through the trouble of hiring them for an episode or two on an anniversary season give them more than a minute heck even have them help you out with some problems or something eiji was almost there but he was nonexistent in his first episode and in the second one he was mainly tied up unable to do anything at all though he did manage to give sougo a nice speech decade at least involved the au riders into things and worked with them sougo feels like he meets the guy gets his upgrade then the episodes basically done geiz had the most interaction with the returning riders so far with that whole kaito thing emu is a runner up
you know he keeps saying this but its starting to feel like  
  after the great dry ice famine of 91
now i am really confused   woz talks about sougo time traveling as a super wrong like time jackers and is disappointed by it   so what the fuck does oma zio do as king of time is he actually a good guy trying to keep time in balance or something
so i take it its safe to assume that this seasons daddy issues are between the primary and secondary riders
  im going to go on a limb here and say oma zio isnt actually a villain the foreshadowing has been there since ep 1 sougo broke up the fight between those thugs by letting them beat him up instead oma zio could be pulling a grander version of that painting himself as the evil villain to unite the 2068 folks against some greater threat to the timeline fits sougos character perfectly him pretending to be kurotos underling also lends credence to this theory the only flaw with it is that sougo and oma zio are seen fighting in the scans but that could easily be another misdirect and oma zio ultimately gives his life to power up sougo
  only if sougo decided to wait until he was 50 to have a kid grandfather/grandson is more likely
  everyone from the future are actually sougos children
  i can actually see that oma zio is the last rider because he wanted to create a world where he was the only rider the world needed
  nearly every scene of this episode can be screencapped its glorious
who wrote this two parter its the first one i like from this show    also anyone has a webm of the tiny melon watch joke
  never mind just found the webm
  this is shimoyama but its honestly got a lot to do with this being directed by kamihoriuchi
  this episode was actually written by mouri not shimoyama shimoyamas probably not coming back till postmovie since hes writing that
i just wanna go play overwatch dammit
  i just want you to know that your efforts are always appreciated thank you
that suica watch gag made me buy a toy fuck
  boy mechs moving to rider from sentai
the first zio episode i actually enjoyed  well ill be too bad kami isnt staying around to save the series
takaiwas shoulders looked like they were suffering throughout the whole fight with the gaim armour on
  ekodama
god kouta vanishing at the end    that almost made up for the nothing that was kaito in these episodes
im so fucking tired of secondary clashes with the main rider we are not friends wait we are friends in the end but im still a fucking prick to you or indifferent at best  its been like 4 seasons already can we go back to the drive and mach wizard and beast kabuto and gattackhere it was kabuto who was a prick but still somehow more friendly to its secondary than most hibiki and ibuki agito and g3x kind of main and secondary    inb4 sento and banjou they were friends  yes but they still butted heads so much it was annoying and tiresome
  i just wanna go play overwatch dammit  how can you still play that shit how are you not bored of the same fucking gameplay its been like 3 years by now
  i think you forgot things in some of ypur examples    mach was a bad guy for a portion of the show when he went edgelord  agito and g3 werent friends at the beginning either at least as riders  and if you arent giving sento and banjou anything then shouldnt give it tendou and kagami either  speaking of which sento and banjou were never on opposite sides they argued but were never outright againest each other
  mach was a bad guy for a portion of the show when he went edgelord  but that was a ruse and he was friendly to drive for most of the show hell even their start conflict was stop being a cunt to the roidmudes and stop using the slowzone shit no fuck yo ok fine and was resolved in like 1 episode then they were good friends for the rest of the showexcept the ruse part  agito and g3 werent friends at the beginning either at least as riders  thats why i said gx3 and not g3 gx3 and agito as far as i remember were on the same side hikawa and souchi were friends from the start  kabuto and gatack  their had friendly banter that wasnt annoying or tiresome    never said opposite sides im just tired of main and secondary disliking each other for the sake of it
  gx3  wat
  g3x my bad one letter and you get confused sorry you know how hard is it
with decade appearing next i felt they wasted a natsumikan pun joke at the end of the episode featuring an orange fruit rider
i want oma zio to step on my face and call me unworthy
so what happened to future sougo
  he went back to his timeline
  but hes only 3 days in the future  wont there just be present sougo thats naturally been 3 days in the future too  how does the loop close theres just 2 sougos running around now
  presumably future sougo disappeared when god kouta did
  but why
  who do i hold responsible for this episode kami can only improve so much with his kino powers so someone had to have fun writing sougo this episode
  i was really expecting him to turn out to be a ghost or an overlord by the end its weird that they didnt go that route
this is the weakest 5 episode the series ever had  no kouta commenting on his godly power and kaito asking the script how did he survive for 5 years with only monsters and dna changing fruits
not how i wanted to know man not how i wanted to know
  im blanking out on who they are who retired
for all i know this place would be a literal garbage dump and swartz would somehow make it sound cool
  they had to channel the greatness to the main ep
  not translating gakuen to high school    whoa
  
this 5 episode made me wanna give up on life
  fuck off /v/ you faggots are worse than /pol/
  woz cheating on sougo with geiz  if this were oma hed have handed down the death sentence to this adulterous prophet
  you fuck off go play your stale team comp first person shooter who hasnt changed since fucking blizzcon 2015
  but its changed a lot and not for the better
  seriously though the people shitting on it now have just decided that theyre going to hate it before they even watch the episode
this weeks 05 episode makes me like shwarz
  so like are all his close ups and weird reactions a reference to something
    play paladins its the far better game
  and its free and actually changed a lot from its humble origins as an overwatch clone
  literally every movie war ever
what the fuck is wrong with swartz
  because god kouta only kept him around using his powers presumably he faded away along with god kouta since that future was erased
  juicy
  its allegedly where toeis studio is located where these guys are now
      the toei animation museum is near that station and they film around those parts often
  its too late now tho         oh god you too huh
  its never too late
  you have the give the cast some credit    they can do comedy really well not as good as in build but they have 40 more episodes to prove me wrong
  41 is a relatively young age for retiring from music
    you guys didnt hear about her retirement because fgo overshadowed it im too lazy to look it up but i remember her studio complaining about that
  once again fgo shows its cancerous effect in japan
  how the game has been around for a while right
i dont know if its due to many kr leads being inexperienced actors or just writing but it feels like a lot of main riders have this earlyshow bland weenie phase that they take a few episodes to grow out of before they grow a real personality sougo managed it after the exaid twoparter and ore wa tenkuuji takeru is what happens when that doesnt occur
  
  sougo and the fatter sougo
  friendship ended with geiz
  as much as i like sougo and woz they havent been as fun as they were this episode outside the 5 mini eps whoever wrote this ep knew exactly how to draw out the best in them
  fgo has been around for 3 years in japan
geiz is trying to be all brooding  as soon as woz says this wozs composure is like skating on thin ice and you can hear him trying so hard not to break down laughing  then when swartz appears everyone and their mother cant keep a straight face with geiz immediately losing it  this is absolutely hilarious
so is swartzs actor is also a play actor
  its literally like the guest stars in gokaiger
watch zio weekly as it airs live  stopped watching the subbed version at the start of wizard arc  fell behind on the 5s since i dont want to watch them without full understanding from the main episodes  sucks real bad
  decade never saved ghost though his last appearance was heisei vs showa
woz no
  episodes 9 10 11 and 12 were all written by nobuhiro mouri whos also writing at least the next arc before this he wrote a few ooo episodes most notably the grasshopper yummy story most of gaims crossover episodes including the toqger special and a bunch of ghost episodes
  yes he was sanada in prince of tennis and is regularly on other plays
  every time fate gacha does an event it hits trending topics on twitter instantly its super popular
  fuck thats how theyre gonna get woz to fight zio im so fucking sick of this rider vs rider shit on every show
  rider vs rider shit is fine but zio is really overdoing it weve had geiz and zio misunderstandings nearly every episode
  is it really misunderstandings when geiz showed up in the first episode openly declaring his intent to kill sougo and has since then made several attempts to kill sougo
when will swartz go ham in main show
  think he meant geiz going hes becoming maoh everytime sougo intervenes him fighting another rider
  implying its not true  you know thats 100 the end game if there is no change in timeline
  at least its not tvn  ah mou
  thats why i said gx3 and not g3    its the same person what the fuck retard    you cant just claim a riders upgraded form is a different character
  nigga you are fucking retarded think of it as time frames g3 is from start of the show to like 23 g3x from 24/25 onwards
    i think youre the one who is retarded here if you are basing it on that then you shouldnt be complaining about most secondaries because by that point they have their shit with the main rider worked out    if you want to sort it into timeframes bullshit then news flash thats the halfway point of the show
  yep you are retarded  im not talking about having their shit figured out or partnering the main rider in battle  im talking about fucking regular ass friendship hikawa and souchi were friends without the unnecessary rudeness or boring headbutting weve had recently    read my original post this is about main and secondaries being friends without one of the other being extremely cold toward the other or outright not friends  emu and hiiro were colleges not friends sento and banjou were headbutting friends sougo and geiz are friends but geiz is all fuck you zio im gonna kill you    i just want a main rider and secondary rider that are not fucking rude to each other out of suit like tomari and gou kouta and micchynot the secondary i know before he went evil takeru and makotothey were always talking about oh yeah we are like brothers eiji and date/gotou
  thats not misunderstandings first until the gaim arc there was literally no change made to the timeline that would have prevented sougo from becoming oma zio which we know because wozs book was still predicting everything all the stuff with geiz tsukuyomi and the time jackers is as far we know part of a stable time loop even now sougo eventually going off the deep end is a legitimate threat    second its not misunderstandings because geiz only held off on trying to kill sougo right away because tsukuyomi pushed him to wait he made it immediately clear that he would take any excuse no matter how small to pick a fight and thats exactly what hes done    theres no miscommunication going on here sougo is legitimately dangerous and geiz is a shorttempered asshole
  you cant justify a show being good if only two of twelve episodes have been actually watchable  the twoparter format is awful the old characters that came back did absolutely jack shit the writing makes no sense the characters are good i give you that but everything else has been mediocre at best  the 5 episodes are golden but the main episodes are painfully bad
  you can if you think ten out of twelve episodes have been watchable and eight out of twelve have actually been quite good no shit if you think the shows bad youre going to think its bad stop watching it if you hate it so much
  time travel rules make no sense  massive plot holes in almost every episode  butchered characterization of old characters or plain misuse  sougo jumps randomly from retard king to an actually competent kamen rider depending on the circumstances  geiz also jumps randomly from a seasoned war veteran to a wimp in every sense of the word  twoparters  you may like it but you cant say that zio is good it isnt
  time travel rules make no sense  the time travel rules are ridiculous but consistent in how theyre shown to work which is all you can ask for with time travel its basically the same rules as deno    massive plot holes in almost every episode  name some that arent about build    butchered characterization of old characters or plain misuse  the only old character whose characterization is off is kusaka and kusakas consistent with how hes been portrayed in other more recent media thats downplayed just what an asshole he was if by misuse youre complaining about how most of the old characters dont have their powers thats how gokaiger did it and you didnt fucking complain then emu doesnt run around being invincible and tendou isnt jumping around through time while styling all over everyone because then the show couldnt be about zio    sougo jumps randomly from retard king to an actually competent kamen rider depending on the circumstances  sougos pretty consistently shown to be a natural at combat and crafty thinker over half of the episodes so far have been about him puppeteering everyone around him to get what he wants hes a doofus who cant do anyones finishers right because it helps people underestimate him including the audience    geiz also jumps randomly from a seasoned war veteran to a wimp in every sense of the word  hes a resistance fighter against a guy who could disintegrate armies with a wave of his hand somehow i dont think geiz was fighting for as long as you think he was in the future or hed be dead the fact that sougos skills as a fighter have already surpassed geiz is deliberate its supposed to be unnerving to him and the other characters how quickly zios power is escalating thats the point    twoparters  theyve been a staple of rider for a decade now theyre not going away half of the most beloved rider shows use twoparters and some of the worst such as ghost dont use them
  geiz also jumps randomly from a seasoned war veteran  when was he a war veteran hes been getting his ass kicked by zio sincce episode 2
  i get that is how theyre doing it i just wish we had more scenes with them is all you dont even need to have them transforming or anything just give them more time like i said aus in decade were around way more so why not do the same thing except now you have the actual actors to work with
  i have some catching up to do but it was kinda getting on my nerves how zio messed up the finishers and catchphrases it felt really wrong in an anniversary season like something power rangers megaforce would do because of laziness whereas in zio its intentional
  its a running gag anon whenever people see it they comment that it looks wrong the duality between zio simultaneously being a wideeyed goofball and an incredibly dangerous overlord in the making is the central concept of the character    if anything itll be a sign to worry if he starts doing the finishers and catchphrases correctly like he does builds right when hes kicking the shit out of geiz
  the time travel rules are ridiculous but consistent in how theyre shown to work which is all you can ask for with time travel its basically the same rules as deno  go back to feudal japan and get thrown into a lake nothing  go back to prehistory and mess with dinosaurs nothing  go back randomly and interact with people actively changing the timelines almost every episode nope still nothing  go back three days in time and interact with yourself tsukuyomi and woz go ballistic instantly    name some that arent about build  exaid still turns into kamen rider exaid when another exaid takes his place on the timeline dan kuroto is still developing gashats  kamen rider club still exists even when fourze was removed from the timeline takumi inui is alive and there when the orphenocs were removed from the timeline  how in the hell did nitou get the wizard ridewatch since wizard was removed from the timeline and he only met him after he became wizard  the continuity gets fucked up if you consider the fact that dan turned into another ooo and killed his dad negating all of the events of exaid but the exaid episode also happened so  team baron exists zawame city is a thing helheim is also a thing and the world isnt taken over by plants also did kaito survive by sheer strength for 5 years in helheim  those are the ones i can remember but im sure ill find more if i analyze every arc carefully    character misuse  takumi did nothing nitou did nothing kusaka was a wellintentioned asshole instead of a complete asshole dan was completely ridiculous kouta just dropped three oranges the old riders are just there giving powerups like npcs instead of being themselves    i give you the sougo and geiz points it seems like geiz is not a resistance fighter but the one guy that survived and managed to get back into the past    and twoparters are a personal issue i think oneparters worked wonderfully with build and exaid
  and some of the worst such as ghost dont use them  nah ghost clearly changed to two parters after the first 13 or so episodes
  go back three days in time and interact with yourself tsukuyomi and woz go ballistic instantly  yeah one has to do with interacting with a past version of yourself and woz stopped beign mad because he trusted that the circumstances merited it and this isnt even an argument for why the time travel makes no sense if anything you could say argue its bad characterization  exaid still turns into kamen rider exaid when another exaid takes his place on the timeline  in 2018 it only happened because zio destroyed a exaid and it took a while to resurrect in 2016 he was able to do it because the erasure isnt instantaneous  dan kuroto is still developing gashats  he was always going to be a gamedev and he turned into ooos in 2013 when we see him in 2016 he isnt developing gashats  kamen rider club still exists even when fourze was removed from the timeline takumi inui is alive and there when the orphenocs were removed from the timeline  gentaro wasnt the only one interested in kamen riders in his own show takumi got turned into a human  how in the hell did nitou get the wizard ridewatch since wizard was removed from the timeline and he only met him after he became wizard  sougo gave him the blank watches like he has done to everyone  the continuity gets fucked up if you consider the fact that dan turned into another ooo and killed his dad negating all of the events of exaid but the exaid episode also happened so  exaid didnt even exist at this point since he was already erased alterations to the timeline dont occur simulatenously the exaid timeline was affected then the ooo one  team baron exists zawame city is a thing helheim is also a thing and the world isnt taken over by plants   hellheim isnt a thing its a gaims ability  the old   emu confronted aexaid without his powers  eiji was used as a weapon by hiina  dan was aooo  kouta sent sougo to the past to teach him a lesson
  exaid still turns into kamen rider exaid when another exaid takes his place on the timeline dan kuroto is still developing gashats    the continuity gets fucked up if you consider the fact that dan turned into another ooo and killed his dad negating all of the events of exaid but the exaid episode also happened    i guess you mean that both of these together is the problem or is there supposed to be an issue with the first one although yeah it seems like the secondary writer seemingly forgot that exaid stuff should still exist during ooos time  although i guess one could argue that there was just a lack of references to the bugster virus rather than any evidence that it had been erased    kamen rider club still exists even when fourze was removed from the timeline  i dont see why this is unbelievable gentaro could see the rider clips in some other situation and still decide to create the club    takumi inui is alive and there when the orphenocs were removed from the timeline    we see what happens there though he loses his powers during the series which is why he doesnt die due to backstory    how in the hell did nitou get the wizard ridewatch since wizard was removed from the timeline and he only met him after he became wizard  well the watches are handled by sogo and/or geiz offscreen it easily could happen depending on how they explain the situation    team baron exists zawame city is a thing helheim is also a thing and the world isnt taken over by plants also did kaito survive by sheer strength for 5 years in helheim  technically its bootleg helheim the official site references the monsters as invesslike monsters rather than outright calling them invess theyre also under another gaims control and he wanted to a dancer so he obviously wouldnt destroy earth although yes its just a shortcut to break rules
  i would argue ghosts first thirteen episodes are also its worst by an insane margin like even when it starts to suck again later it never gets as bad as those first thirteen
woz concerned about geopolitics  dude youre from the future you know whats going to happen
  we see what happens there though he loses his powers during the series which is why he doesnt die due to backstory    but inui was an orphenoc has been for years before the start of faiz meaning at some point prior he had died and revived as a zombiewolfthing no orphenocs means no revival which means no takumi
i dont understand
  saionji was just not a charismatic villain and the stupid fetch quest was just childish even for a kids show
    geiz thinks sougo is going evil everytime he plans something like in wizard
    people think drive is good when only post banno the series is serviceable
  imma guess that the original accident that turned takumi into an orphenoc just plain didnt happen to him same as exaid not existing completely wiped out the bugster virus and made kuroto into a peon his dads company since he never discovered it
  buildfags cant handle anything that isnt their precious brony show
  bluepilling on zio  anon
  the time travel rules are ridiculous but consistent in how theyre shown to work  literally 1 thread debated about how consistent it is just to be agreed by the end that eh fuck it you are retarded to expect consistency in a rider show much less about time travel
how am i supposed to take swartz seriously after that 5 that wasnt how i expected his actor to act at all    fun episode otherwise though
i dont know about you guys but ooo arc felt a lot more enjoyable than gaim arc the host for another gaim was forgettable and the least focused part of the conflict and future sougo didnt get any closure after the fight ooo arc had its own issues too mainly the crammed cgi mech fight but the sheer presence of a likable another rider host with character beyond just being dan kuroto great use of its cameo characters and crafty blend of two different rider series aspects with the overlord theme of zio via nobunaga just make it the most enjoyable episode arc
  the cgi mech fight in the ooo arc was great though    both arcs were pretty great if you ask me
  ooo arc barely had eiji in though  i get why kurotovirgins are pkay with it but i cant understand why eijichads are happy hina was pointless as well  might as well call it actually good version of exaid arc and nothing would change really
  and the least focused part of the conflict  i thought that the little focus it got was too much as it was the dancing shit gaim had was and still is unbearable
  zio doesnt seem to really be an anniversary series the way its being advertised its pretty intentionally having all these cameos of old characters giving the new cast advice on how to handle shit which i dont think is a bad approach except for what i just said about how the show is advertised peoples expectations arent being met
  i dont know why people have expectations of all the old riders running around with their powers decade did that and people fucking hated it while gokaiger did pretty much the exact same thing that zio is doing and everyone fucking adored gokaiger of course they would follow the model of the bigger critical and commercial success
  eiji had some good scenes in the 2nd episode he was just missing in the first one
  he had like two scenes in total in ep 2  in a fucking ooo arc  i think even fourze had more screentime despite having a standin out of suit
  there was little eiji time but it did look like it matters to sougos awareness of what a good king should be like since he unironically wanted to learn that from dan kuroto it also did well with depicting a different side to eiji if he remained with the diet following his tragedy in which he still would be eiji by his basic beliefs its the big implications from short effective screentime that hold a lot more effect than kaito is still kaito even when he is stuck in a forest for 5 years
  but decade was a bigger commercial success in merchandising box office and even ratings this last one gokaiger couldnt even get a real boost at all gokaiger just had warmer fan reception    and decades complaints mostly came from the lack of original actors and the messed up ending original actors would immediately fix one of those points and the other just came from a bad production and last minute changes
  gokaiger wasnt a 2parterheavy series when it actually uses them its for major upgrades or plotrelevant developments which is precisely what 2parters are meant to be used for
  shirakura is trying to turn back the clock and go back to the previous status quo of twoparters as the norm well see how long it lasts
  i think even fourze had more screentime despite having a standin out of suit
narrative gundam cpack revealed
damn i held out for nothing i like the look of the narrative but a and b packs werent doing it for me and now c is replacing armor
why did they forget the bicep armor    looks good otherwise like a little babby unicorn
  its unicorn but worse  par for the course
  looks like ass discount dendrobium  discount unicorn
  aaaaaaaah just give it regular armor this is going to look like absolute shit in kit form
yamero
  did you rike it
  so its just a manlet uniorn
  nu gundam with unicorn psychoframe    i could make something like that through just kitbashing and even then itd look better than this shit
  its ok i guess but god damn now the exposed biceps stick out like a sore thumb even more
damn so much for the mc eventually piloting phenex itself     is it true that the phenex is actually a disembodied loli
  do it  no seriously i want to see it
  purposely sabotaging uc to give sunrise a wakeup call so they can finally animate his decadehidden frozen teardrop designs    based
  i see that it still forgot upper body day at the ms gym    no amount of squats is going to get past those trex arms as /fit/ knows
  he has literally nothing to do with narrative mecha design in any shape or form
  you can tell katoki designed the narrative just by looking at its legs/chest proportions
  are you retarded
  does it hurt being this stupid
  if novel spoilers are right he will narrative will get trashed by ii neo zeong    you even see the core fighter getting saved by the silver bullet in the last trailer
i still prefer the finincom pack more
  while i think that having the mcs gundam be a scrappy betatest unicorn is interesting narratively no pun intended but i just cant see this design being popular in gunpla form
  fincoms
  also the nt gundam does nothing particularly impressive or significant jona gets into the phenex at the end
  i think this is actually a decent look for the patchwork nature of narrative after watching the preview
  i assume the gimmick will be it being an easily modified frame that you put together how you want since the suit is well not much more than the frame in its natural form    like even the minimal armor it has in most pictures is bolted on option equipment
neet gundam
  its the uc gself designed to have modular shit that means you have to buy 6 different kits to get every pack
  betatest unicorn  but its literally the betatest nu  the narrative has nothing to do with the unicorn other than having a psychoframe
  i dont like the shoulders
  its much smaller than the nu
so its literally the development units between the nu and the unicorn
  i liked how the fed pilot called it a scarecrow  that makes more sense that narrative as a name
  no  its a prototype frame used to test weapons for the nu    narrative  nu  unicorn   xi
  never skip arm day nerds
  am i crazy or do other suits not look like straight up gunpla like this one does
  its a prototype frame used to test weapons for the nu  so narrative is exbein    then numkiii and unicornexexbein    but then what is xi
is the narrative just a stripped down mu gundam
  the proportions are kinda there
  first was penelope that officially was the last of project zeta then anaheim secretly builds a version with a much improved more compact minovaky flight system calls it the xi and sells it to mufti
  anaheim secretly builds a version with a much improved more compact minovaky flight system calls it the xi and sells it to mufti  they just had to jew one more time
  i think it either predates the mu or existed along side it
weed gundam
  can afford to give it psycho frame  cant afford to give it some fucking armor    bandai probably knows itll look exactly like unicorn
   afford to give it psycho frame  but it has a psychoframe retard    why dont you stick to shitposting about shows youve actually watched
  its probably meant to be scavanged psycoframe since mineva apparently didnt dismantle and dispose of the unicorn properly like she promised      learn to read
  why dont you stick to shitposting about posts youve actually read
  youre probably right the psycho frame parts are in the same spots as the unicorn gundams      no anon you are the retard pic related
  just want the narrative gundam  the suit itself with incom backpack is pban whilst fuckhuge metior pack thingy is regular release  this ugly pos will be regular retail too
  mineva apparently didnt dismantle and dispose of the unicorn properly like she promised  why would she ever do such a thing
  the narrative has nothing to do with the unicorn other than having a psychoframe    well it has a roundabout relationship if not for amuro and the nu gundam being part of the axis shock event the federations fearboner over newtypes might not have reached the fever pitch that led to the development of ntd and since narrative was part of nus development process you could say its separated from the rx0 machines by only a few degrees
  the pbandai is solely the incom backpack lol just an add on
    couldnt we just have the silver bullet instead
  1800 yen for just the backpack to an hg
  pretty much
  makes it look like a build fighters custom of the narrative
wait its actually a barzam in disguise
is planetes /m/
tough one i asked myself this some time ago i arrived to the conclusion that its not really /m/ but that its a drama about a /m/an i watched it not long after it came out though so i dont really remember how much /m/ech is featured in it     also i recommend it to everyone it is a must watch wether its considered /m/ or not just thinking about the show gives me the good kind of willies
spacecraft have always counted
  yes it is  mecha isnt strictly gundam and super robot stuff but the influx of newfags over the years has made it seem like that    planetes is /m/  ghost in the shell is /m/  star wars is /m/  macross is /m/  eva is /m/  flcl is /m/  time of eve is /m/    mecha is a very vague thing it cant really even be described as a genre anymore  its more of a set of visuals themes and stories that adhere to an aesthetic primarily including robots of any kind
      considering that we consider /m/ shows with lots of mechanical stuff but not necessarily focused on them like lotgh id say that planetes is more /m/ than many others
  realistic spaceflight is /m/ as fuck
  is initial d /m/  whats the barrier between /m/ and not /m/
best use of frame of reference in an introductory sequence
  initial d can be considered /m/ to me but id say its soft mecha  it has some elements of mecha like the bond between a man and their partner machine  and the story revolves around this dynamic and the mcs strength and personal growth coinciding with that of his skill in the machine    but its not explicitly mecha
  that one third world made spacesuit was basically powered armor its totally /m/
it is now
i still cant believe hes gone
  spaceship are automatically /m/    future spaceship is obviously /m/
    how much of this is /m/
/m/  mecha    no limbs not a mecha
  i have limbs am i a mecha
  the toy box has robotic arms for debris retrieval
  objects in canuck
  i like how manga was more on worldbuilding side  i liked the political aspect of the tv series more
    breaking my heart man hes in a better place though
  so thats why he sweated so much
  not to mention dextre
/m/ is practically just a retro anime board now desu
  2003 is retro  anon what the fuck
  might be painful to admit but 2003 is in retro territory now everything pre2006 is
  theres flaws but its one of the rare anime adaptation that i consider superior to the source material    they added 3 times more characters and yet they all mesh together as if they were always meant to exist and have their role having clair look like the snobby bitch against hachimaki then turn out hachimaki is the one with a glorious father and she is the poor minority was a masterstroke they removed some slow parts that meant almost nothing for a larger storyline that encompass all of mankind without making our mc into a band of roving heroes  im very pleased they dared changing scenes entirely like the rescue on the moon to do what was best  even changing the space mine was a good call only a retarded trump country would take their chance against a kessler syndrom realistically they would try to neutralize ship remotely    i was also surprised to discover the manga artist is the guy who make vinland saga
  one of the major inspirations of mecha isnt mecha
     its more of a set of visuals themes and stories that adhere to an aesthetic    sounds like a genre to me
  does anyone have that screenshot of when moot band that guy for shiting on planets
  no shit next youll be surprised that one of the major inspirations for a heavierthanair flying machine isnt a machine
i remember liking the anime when i saw it a while ago but i read the manga recently and it was awful
  good show but the episode about the guys wife destroyed me
  /m/ is pretty much a science fiction board in general
  that one and episode 11 are my favorites
  thats because screen writers fundamentally changed the plot from description of a realistic space age to a drama set in the said space age it results in radical change in characterization subplots and number of characters for example much of  hachis trauma and recovery arc happens in the 1st volume itself way before ai joined the team anime actually has ai around the time of hachis accident and subsequent trauma  resulting in a dramatic storyline much different than the clarkeesque story of manga it can be understandable given that manga is quite short just 4 volumes long and was aiming for different kind of story so it helped to expand the plot over 26 episodes in that manner personally i feel that fee and locksmiths portion were still better in manga   for this reason i believe that planetes anime is one of those cases where they managed to pull off modifications in adaptation that works so well it becomes its own thing in a good way to the point i think both are different things altogether and must be seen as such instead of taking one as substitute of the other which is why i see the planetes anime and the manga as their own thing
  i read and watched both so you know  however im triggered by your choice of words here  from __ realistic space age   to a drama set in the space age  the drama ended up more realistic so you had to keep the word      i suppose thats the one but i dont know if its moot      destroyed me  what do you mean by that not that its lacking in impact but i would think other episodes raised any bar bad or wrong  as stupid as it was the ninja on the moon would actually be useful to make movie
  please save yuri
  i read and watched both so you know  i did not imply otherwise  however im triggered by your choice of words here   __ realistic space age   to a drama set in the space age  the drama ended up more realistic so you had to keep the word   reread my sentence again in case you inferred it wrong  not being condescending just clarifying what i am saying is that   manga  description of a realistic space age with most plausible tech  anime  drama set in the aforementioned space age  arguing which one had realistic drama is moot since both are fundamentally different kind of stories manga hachi is an entirely different character than anime hachi
  close enough
does eva actually prevent people from getting into mecha a lot of mecha fans see eva after theyve already seen something else like one of the toonami gundam series whereas if eva is someones first mecha series it also tends to be their last
  of course it does thats why so many people here call eva an /a/ show im not about to argue its not mecha but all of its mecha aspects are completely superficial to the show it doesnt make people interested in mecha it makes people interested in its drama so they go after more of that instead not one of the shows plot points couldnt have been accomplished without mecha
  gainax/trigger anime is stuff made by people who like old anime for people who hate old anime
  i for one got into mecha through evangelion though it wasnt a quick it took me long to get out of eva and into watching other things i was about to take the road and watch gurren lagann and never watch any mecha until i watched the original gundam and got hooked then its another hurdle since i was also stuck in just watching gundam shows that was until i watch shin mazinger and was opened up to super robot and then i watched variety of mecha shows since then and now im here
no thats stupid if someone who doesnt like mecha watches eva because of how popular it is and they dont watch more its because they didnt like mecha in the fist place
oh for the love of god normalfags arent turned off by /m/ because of eva they already thought /m/ was gay lame and stupid to begin with but watched eva simply because its concidered a classic you see the same effect with the gundam trilogy they watch the trilogy begrudgingly but since watching zeta or v or x or turna doesnt get them gold star patrician on mal theyll tell you no im good     heres the reason why mecha isnt loved in the west they think its kiddy and wont make them look interesting to their peers or the opposite sex the burger weebs greatest kryptonite is looking childish so they wont watch orguss and the sure as fuck arent going to watch a brave show     its also the reason why genres and shows targeted at a male audience is more heavily scrutinized then one towards the female audience women just watch what they want while men are constantly peacock about with what they like and showing superior tastes to the other plebian males
  they think its kiddy  okay but why and how does that hold any weight when they also watch battle shounen
    cause shit like this and voltron and transformers plastered that stigmata in with cement its like trying to get someone to watch garo you can try but i doubt youll ever succeed     battle shounen is marvel its accepted to like it but youll see plenty of fuckers screaming about how mature and sophisticated they are for not liking it and theres always people trying to tell you how dark and grimngritty hitman reborn is its still peacock dancing
  its all surface level bullshit of course old super robot shows look kiddy on the surface but anybody whose actually watched one would know most of them werent fucking kiddy at all but you cant tell that to a normalfag without them rolling their eyes at you
  no shit its surface level bullshit since we all could probably cite the top ten of any otaku that we meet at any con if i went up to any of them with a copy of dancouga nova angel cop or school days and the shmuck had no prior knowledge of any of the shows im betting 100000 that none of those fuckers would pick the good show dancouga theyd just pick the show that looked more socially acceptable    pic related he probably doesnt know what a dancouga is
  i dont like braves because i cant stand the way they look sue me
    hol up where are you getting copies of dancouga nova
  the good show dancouga
  cant blame you ive seen a ton of robot toys as a kid that looked like one of those brave mechs with animal heads on their chest and all i could ever think was that they looked like lame ripoff transformers this is before i found out the series influenced eachother     i recently began watching might gaine and it feels weird seeing those mech designs i hated as a kid the show hasnt picked up much and so far every episode has ended with might gaine combining and doing the same finishing attack on the villain of the week
  this is an interesting observation
  thats the opposite  if you discovered gundam now you would believe its just a childish show / gunpla ads without taking seriously any of the war themes of the original  gundam origin however is reversing that but it will never air on mass media    even 20 years later evangelion still brutally murder expectation and make you look for more anime that take their mecha as more than toy  rebuild of evangelion however is killing this for the same reason as gundam    but theres a reason so many /m/ series of the last decade still try to improve over evangelions recipes
  thats a very interesting point    i agree that many most people watch eva for the drama and that you can get away with the mecha entirely and still works but i really dont think that the /m/ aspect of eva is superficial  there is a lot of discussion of the inner workings of the evas weapons tactics etc actually way more than in many mecha series proper i believe that people who do not get interested in mecha after eva wouldnt have been interested regardless as    say
  the would pick the good one    that would be angel cop then
  make you look for more anime that take their mecha as more than toy    thats the majority of the genre though the subverted expectations come in when an eva fan actually watches other mecha shows and realize that their beliefs about how eva was so much more mature and different just came from them having b experience with the genre
  evafags dont watch other mecha
  i love having an excuse to post this
  my initial reaction to eva was that it was an episodic motw story with some abstract designs and above average characters eoe was a decent lsd trip i guess but the whole thing didnt come off to me like the wow 10/10 artistic deconstruction greatest anime of all time people love to parrot it as
  itll more likely to get them to watch ultraman or ideon if they cared enough to go back to its roots if anything
  everyone presumes that all mecha shows are like transformer g1 tv series almost everyone in western anime fandom wants validation as a connoisseur who consumes highbrow art in form of anime we get people repeating whatever popular opinion community has as pointed by  and   google genre deconstruction it will always show some shitty tvtropes pages and anime forums i wish we could go back to good old days when watching japanese animation videos on vhs was considered cool enough regardless of material one is watching  that genuine happiness seems absent in online anime forums specially when it becomes battle of bigger epeen with huge ass animelists or acting like a patron when someone asks good anime to watch
  do you remember when you could talk about laputa in the same breath as amon saga and not get a stink eye look when shonen battle anime wasnt a dirty word and ranma 1/2 was animes golden child     do you remember when you could mention guyver slayers and magic knight rayearth and that that person in the convention would know what you were talking about that they wouldnt put on airs about the shows deeper or shallow qualities and try to dissect it with post modernist talk     remember when the anime community was super fun and friendly
  what went wrong
  people who watch ttgl wont watch other mecha anime
  naruto
  spoiler  its getting a tv version in 2019 expect it to air on toonami if it isnt dead by then  not that toonami is really mass media anymore
  its usually as you say opbut eva only got me further into mecha when i was a 14 year old autist although i had previously enjoyed pacific rim greatly so theres that
  but theres a reason so many /m/ series of the last decade still try to improve over evangelions recipes  theres only like 3 shows i can think of that were inspired by eva dude    the only reason people are okay with eva as opposed to other mecha is the monstrous look of the evangelions im almost convinced of that no one gives a shit about zambot even though zambot came earlier and is even more grim going all in on character death where eva pussied out in most cases because zambot itself is a goofy combining robot samurai and the art looks like shit    evas edgy robots give western teens plausible deniability its not kiddyshit i swear
  it happens tons of times in other broad fandoms when a fandom grows exponentially large it usually creates a hierarchy or caste system of fans     take movies for example you have the shlubby plebian on the ground who loves adam sandler and micheal bay movies who think that titanic and avatar were the bestest movies ever    then theirs the beret wearing faggot who tells you how the cinema is art talk endlessly about truffoit and godard and bergman and will analyze the shit out of every single frame of every terrence malick film     then theres the guy in the middle whos not a stone cold retard like the first guy but not an atentionwhore asshole like the second guy who understands that films can be art but their first and foremost for enjoyment not pretentious prattling but hed rather get good enjoyment then the one from a bottom feeding fish sadly no one listens to that guy and not knowing how to serve all three the producer will make run of the mill pedestrian work that they know wont offend any of the parties just irritate them     the anime fandom is like that except far more spergy far less intelligent and the guys in the middle is a shrinking minority overwhelmed by moeshit that just wont stop    also our standards for quality are infinitely lower then in films which has shit like solaris or tokyo story where ours is isnt whats objectively great or the best the medium have offered but what dumbasses watched on cartoon network we dont got no roger ebert to set the standard of critque
  i dont know man eva is still probably my first experience with /m/ if youd call it that and im heavily into all the classics both tokusatsu and giant robot anime now thanks to the influence they had on anno
  tldr  assholes who wanted to wear the big boy pants dictated arbitrarily that they were the intellectual class of the fandom and found anything slightly mature or poetic to be profound and praised it to high heaven while the bottom feeding fish wanted to look smart and kept reciting the same drivel those ontop kept spewing like a shit eating oroboros worm
  only 3  i only go that low if i stop at plotless shit that only exist to copy other stuff rahxephon  dont confuse with series who did watched how evangelion said established tropes can be portrayed as horrible and decided to drop all the childish stuff they would have done and made something tasteful  original knowing sc was successful like that    eva implied the death of a lot of people just not a lot of mc when you look at the shit that happen maybe a meticulously animated crushing death of toji would have made it more lighthearted  nge debut is pretty childish outside of the monster mech ill agree and it never totally dissociate itself from the tropes of childish super robot but what it does with it is absolutely not kiddyshit  compare that with recent gundam which take the war is bad heritage but still use it to cater to younger child and advertise gunpla  incidently gundam 00__ copied evangelion as well i could make a long list on that one without touching all the other sources  only universal century avoid that and thats only because they know their fanbase want more than a pilotkid
  gundam 00 copied eva  go back to /a/ you faggot youre clearly not smart enough for this board
  2nd impact imagery  meticulous silent recap to talking statues  a god damn eva failed synchro scene  notshinji and notasuka scene  magi/veda computer  notasuka death to the other expy  top of head  next youll tell me 00 didnt copy full metal panic
  i think her chin is the size of her waist
  rahxephon  eva clone  lmao no its literally an updated version of raideen you know that one anime tomino directed the first half at least look for the interviews    tldr it all goes back to tomino
  author copypaste eva scene  pretend its inspiration from a less popular story to not look like a lazy hack  typical denial lets skip ahead where you tell us how you get dozen scenes recreated word for word    to complete the loop your answer must explain why rei is a brain damaged monster why asuka is a n emotionless bitch and why best girl is yui__
  i dont see why it would anyone going into anime is going to see enough nod to eva theyll want to see what the hell it is  rebuild of evangelion is more of a problem because thats what the new generation is going to watch first
  this entire post
  the internet
  but how did everyones exposure get more narrow when so much more became available to them
    its the i never watched rahxephon myself and listen to randos cherry picking shit out of context so it has to be an eva clone meme again
  nobody who isnt into mecha already watched nge because of the mecha thats the reason
  personal attack and baseless smear because he have no argument  anyone who watched both shows and arent a fanboy or a troll concede it would be nothing if it didnt take from eva but keep trying maybe youll find a insult so scatting the internet will stop calling it a eva clone
  dancouga isnt a masterpiece but its a solid show with a lot of great things  probably would have been better as a series of ova instead of tv though
  anon i like raideen as much as the next guy but rahxephon doesnt even pretend to hide where story influences come from  it blatantly ripoffs eva while covering it with raideen imagery  in fact it would activly improve the show if creators went with something closer to the original version
  also our standards for quality are infinitely lower then in films which has shit like solaris or tokyo story where ours is isnt whats objectively great or the best the medium have offered but what dumbasses watched on cartoon network we dont got no roger ebert to set the standard of critque  eva is uniroinically our standard no matter how bitter it makes some feel
people who get into mech through eva expect creativity  instead they get about 20 seasons of ultraman using the exact same plot and almost every gundam hummering war is really bad guys it really is trust us message over and over again not to mention amount of stock footage formulaic writing and shit directing this genre has  can you really blame people for turning off  at least popular mainstream modern shounens dont look like garbage most of the time  mech is and always was a niche thing liking it doesnt make you an elitist or superior to people who have neither time nor desire to be real anime fans pretentious experts and ecelebs aside
  eva  creative
  do i get to hear more memes about eva ripping off ultraman and ideon from people who havent seen either nice
  given were talking flash lets just start with   why cant she be subbed bros
  people have actually subbed more of it however im unsure if itll ever be complete
  something about having a nuclear reactor hpht furnace and about 5 other devices in your chest is incompatible with modern science     no matter how big you depict her tits
  delete this
  i like this honey what is her name
  honey jack
  because even if she were she wouldnt give your fat loser otaku ass a second glance and would probably end up being a dyke anyway
  we are sickos that dont deserve it
  speaking of sickos anybody got a link to that doujin where honey finds out she was only created by her father to be a walking onahole for him
  honey guns men
thats the worst version of her anyway
is shin the sequel to the toei one
  what are you watching /m/
  oh only now noticed her nipples stand out under the top in best shin tradition nice
  flash  the worst
  youre right that would be universe  jk nipples will probably push it to top honey adaptation
  because bernie lost the primary and cant fulfill his campaign promise to make anime real
  red dead honey
  why cant she be real  but she is anon what else would she be negative limitative    but really she is more of an allegory anyway pure goodness something for you to look up to and compare your own imperfect morality to of course she is completely amoral just like panther zora  naturally you could also simply fap to her if thats what she means to you
  honey lived in my dorm and heres my bisected body to prove it
  why cant she be real  because shes super
  bernie   not ron paul   zoomer newfag
  ron paul  autist
  the bd actually has them
  the bd actually has them  from his wording id say he already knew that  by the way has someone managed to find a rip of those blu rays online or some way to properly import them
  shes incredible math
  i call your incredible math and raise you perfect chemistry pic related
so is honeys butt small though
  so is honeys butt small though  yes at least for all preuniverse versions    この頃 はやりの女の子  お尻の小さな女の子  こっちを向いてよハニー
  if it was made today she would have a much bigger butt maybe even too big
  it thought chiisana was more of an idiom for having what would commonly be called a tight ass or otherwise clearly defined and shapely rather than the literal meaning of small  because that aint small
  because that aint small  thats the joke but to be fair the song applied to the anime not the manga    as for your actual point 小 chii literally means small but you are right in that in this situation it is intended to be a compliment not fat but as you put it tight and femine pretty much ideal according to japanese beautystandards
its small desu
  that mouth  go nagai really never gave a fuck did he
  that mouth  i agree sister jills mouth in that picture looks simply appaling then again she is an ugly old hag 
mazinger zeros honey is hawt
  why isnt this guy doing a cutey honey manga
  why isnt this guy doing a cutey honey manga  dont know why arent you doing a cutie honey manga
  its actually two guys yoshiaki tabata and yuki yugo
mazinger angels honey is hot
  absolutely t h i c c
so  favourite nonnagai cutie honey manga everyone    ill put forward ooedo honey by yamaguchi masakazu not for being an elaborate narrative milestone i admit but because i love the general idea honey in a historical setting and that it features some nice action with my tarantula
  thicc and puffy
do forgive me for the ignorance but i know nothing of cutie honey besides some general knowledge picked up around here over the years    is the franchise actually good or is the appeal mostly how precious cutie is whats the best way to get into it the original manga/tv series
  watch ovas best bang/buck
  new cutie honey and re cutie honey yeah will do thanks mate
  is the franchise actually good or is the appeal mostly how precious cutie is  it is actually good yes people do fap to honey and other characters but it is probably the best exploration on the field of ethics as a whole and human morality specifically in go nagais works though some may argue that devilman does it better honey not cutie is precious because is is pure goodness not because shes attractive    it is a go nagai franchise of course so you might or might not enjoy it depending on how much you like nagai in general      whats the best way to get into it  id say the manga 1973 is the best entry point hands down  but if youre looking for an anime there are some good options  the original 1973 anime as it was the first  flash especially if you are a sailor moon fan its not cempletely subbed though  universe if you want something that feels very much like the manga    i do not advice you to start with either  shin as that is sort of a sequel story to the original anime  rech which while fun isnt close to what the franchise is about at its core  any of the live action stuff all of which is at least as derivative as re    but whatever you choose as your first experience you should definitely continue with other iterations and have fun
  dont that guy literally told you to go for the best fap material if you care for the story do not start with a sequel and do not start with the least accurate representation of the franchise
    oh geez the first manga only has 2 volumes ill just read that and expand organically from there cheers    flash especially if you are a sailor moon fan  fuck yeah    its not cempletely subbed though  oh
  its not cempletely subbed though  oh  if you know or at least understand german  theres a bad german dub out there and even completely uploaded to some streaming services as i recently found out
  a bad german dub  does it have a techno opening like sailor moon did
  does it have a techno opening like sailor moon did  no it has badly translated or rather newly made up german lyrics just like sailor moon but quite differently from sailor moon it did use the original main theme        by the way is this the only instance of onegai in a different language
  also for your convenience i went the extra mile of translating the lyrics and no i didnt make it anything up theyre really this trite wordy and cringeworthy    süß wie wilder honig und beherzt ist die heldin  gertenschlank bezaubernd und schön sieht sie aus  sie hat die kraft der liebe  wenn sie es nur will wächst sie über sich hinaus    sweet like wild honey and sprited the heroine is  willowy charming and pretty she looks  she has the power of love  if only she wants shell excel    cutey honey cutey honey  sie verändert unsre welt  sie verwandelt sich und handelt  wie vom blitz wird dann die erde erhellt    cutey honey cutey honey  she changes our world  she transforms and acts  then earth is illuminated as by lightning    so kämpft sie so siegt sie nie unterliegt sie  und dann ruft sie honey flash  sie ist ehrlich unentbehrlich    thus she fights thus she wins she never yields  and then she calls out honey flash  she is honest indispensable    cutey honey cutey honey  cutey honey verliert nie  sie ist ehrlich einfach unentbehrlich  zauberhaft und voller magie  so kämpft sie so siegt sie nie unterliegt sie  und dann ruft sie honey flash     cutey honey cutey honey  cutey honey never loses  she is honest simply indispensable  charming and filled with magic  thus she fights thus she wins she never yields  and then she calls out honey flash
  lets get arr to finish it they already have a go nagai fan as their main volunteer editor and thats how steel jeeg finally got finished
  thanks krautbro
  and theres also spanish subs of it until the end out there
  neat  by the way is this the only instance of onegai in a different language  animetal usa did an english cover of it    neat
  animetal usa did an english cover of it  thanks never knew of that and it was surprisingly hard to find  i must say it does sound a bit underwhelming  but so does their other stuff not sure whether thats down to them and their adaptation skills or whether anime songs arent easily forced into this style  then again  koda kumi did manage a respectable rocky version of onegai and luz electronic verysoftmetal version is quite nice as well
how about a little bump with some fanart
  yeah animetal usa is very hit or miss  their girl shows medley lacks the umf that animetal lady brought    i do like some of their stuff like their cover of dyrl the first mkr opening and the dbz openings
  i do like some of their stuff like their cover of dyrl the first mkr opening and the dbz openings  yeah okay i listened to those just now and they are a bit better though i think the lead vocalists voice is what i mostly have a problem with it just seems a bit too  mild
  now that i think about it are there any covers of dyrl with the real english lyrics misa hands minmay
  are there any covers of dyrl with the real english lyrics misa hands minmay  i doubt it that would require making them out in the first place  horrible handwriting
  i think theres a decent shot of them in one of the art books and there should be a better view in the hd version
so wait is the english translated version not the entire series of flash ive had it for ages but if im missing parts i feel completely flabbergasted    also who loves the movie
  well holy shit i had to go look it up this whole time i thought shin cutey honey was the same thing as flash and ive ignored so much awesomeness
  well now that your eyes have been opened to a whole new world you can join the many anons in despair over the missing subs    and  well  if you want more suggestions for cutie honey stuff that you most likely dont know translated or untranslated just ask there are so many great untranslated manga that you probably missed one that adapted flash for example  and there are three different liveaction adaptations  also just to make sure you know of all anime now there are 5 1973 shin flash re universe
  im downloading flash currently and ive seen re and universe the live action movie and the live action series that had mikie hara in it    i dont know if i could handle the 73 show it looks like its too old school for me    as a sorta tangental fill in i really like birdy the mighty
  i like the mystery of whether we see birdy nipple or a part of the shirt fabric still narrowly maintaining a laststand covering it
  the live action movie  which one 2004 or tears both are quite  different but definitely worth watching    i dont know if i could handle the 73 show it looks like its too old school for me  well give it a try it is kinda oldschool and you might need a few episodes to get accustomed to it but it is a nice little series    and of course reading the 1973 manga is advised as that one is the original after all
  i think the 2004 one ill go look for tears and ill get the 73 show and see how i like it
  anyone else doing a rewatch of the original animes episode 5 this weekend it aired exactly 45 years ago and she was great in it  by the way im rewatching all the episode at the moment like i wrote last week in the thread on /a/  i cant be the only one doing this
one from the /a/ drawthread by jtsketch

  i want to eat dat ass
  i want to eat dat ass  dont you dare touch my waifu  just joking shes not shy about something like this im not jealous and our relationship isnt that fragile and i can definitely see why youd find her attractive
  ill take her sisters ass then
  her sisters ass  her big sister jill  hope you survive that anon
  hey nice to see that people other than me are now starting to bump with tarantula pics thanks mate    though i now feel i should balance that out and post something nontarantula for a change pic related
  i just posted that because im reading the manga now  i tried starting with the anime but it seems a little slow for my current mood i have that problem with some of the older anime adaptations of go nagai comics
  its an anime adaptation of a go nagai comic longwinded and poorly paced due to being stretched out ad nauseum  cutie honey anime are generally better than devilman anime and some others in that regard but yeah the 70s one is very 70s and not very suited to modern viewing habits though you should get used to it after a few episodes    if you want one that feels very much like the manga while still adding its own twists and turns try ch universe  if you just want fast pace and dont care much for an authentic adaptation try rech    and if you want one thats not an adaptation at all theres shin ch that one is a sequel to the orignial anime but works as one to the manga 1973 which means the first two volumes if you have a 4volumerelease as well
  heh i see what you did there no problem  my response still fits but have another webm
    ill probably jump back on it once i finish the manga and find the mood for something a little slower it wasnt bad but im just not all that patient at the moment    i heard universe was ass but i might give it a shot anyway
  i heard universe was ass  the only ones propagating that are tumblrites not joking some of them come here to spam cutie honey threads with their hate and negativity  the same people also hate on the manga basically they are mostly fans of the original anime you can read up on some very revealing discussions in older cutie honey threads in the archive  if you dont mind spoilers    oh and re fans from /u/ of course we also got a lot of those spamming the weekly universe threads when it aired as it wasnt quite as inyourface about its lesbianism
  in that case ill give it a shot thanks anon
  /u/  not /y/
  thottie honey
how about more from the drawthread  this one is a genderbent thus male version of tarantula
and another one from the drawthread  small and simple still cute
by wachichan  finalfantasyinspired boss fight with tarantula as one of the party members
  can confirm we had chu threads get derailed by hard leftist politics like   stalin did nothing wrong those kulaks were asking for it  level politics     it made the threads pretty shit
  it made the threads pretty shit  well yeah we had those things happen wasnt that specific occurence in the episode 4 thread from the same radical feminist that complained about the statue scene  i was more refering to those that were extremely nitpicky later on often without knowing what they were talking about the funniest thing ive heard must have been a selfconfessed fan of the 1973 anime complaining about universes animation fluidity and colourchoice  its always the haters trying to ruin it for people who like a thing not much we can do about that    but id still say the threads as a whole were quite cozy sometimes more so sometimes less still always a good opportunity to discuss all things cutie honey and on a weekly basis with the franchise gaining new fans
  the only ones propagating that are tumblrites  as a nontumblrite my only criticisms towards chu were the fight scenes being stiff and not having nipples which i know now the dvds do so im waiting for someone to upload bdrips to watch chu
  my only criticisms towards chu were the fight scenes being stiff and not having nipples  which is fair the fights were generally short and uneventful they werent universes main selling point to begin with and there were no nipples which is the same for other cutie honey adaptations that aired on tv but they didnt get an update for homevideo  the thing is that neither of these things is worth making a fuzz over in the dedicated threads  and for the nipplesissue as well as for its different intro which was toeis fault it was attacked far too harshly by some    another valid criticism is that it had slight pacing issues in the first few episodes at least for an episodic series bingewatching it it feels far more natural  it did obviously opt for a traditionalstyle exposition but i still didnt think it would work that much better in a backtoback rewatch  and lets be honest nearly every series anime or otherwise fucks up its pacing at one point at least
  but is she really human
  but is she really human  well  theres one easy way to find out have her solve a googlecaptcha
might as well post it here  theres a draw your waifu with this strange onlinetool thread on /a/ right now so i did  just a very quick mousesketch and many things that urk me about it im really not an artist but hey who cares    animation  
  it would be really informative since i cant seem to solve it
  since i cant seem to solve it  robot detected
as ive run out of drawthread deliveries to bump this thread with heres the sailor moon another story inspired pixel stuff i made    i omitted a few sprites that contain implied nudity for blueboard reasons just to be safe full version here  
  also at the moment im doing similar sprites for tarantulas cutie honey a go go version the longhaired one heres a work in progress the enemysprites are done the portraits are a bit more difficult  but im getting there  she soesnt have an official colourscheme so i experimented a bit and tried to give her something that resembled other versions colourschemes plus three different palettes for her human disguise    again pic related only shows whats definitely worksafe heres the rest  
  bump  and well a small update to this because why not
  page 10 again  another wip halfway done  sorry i dont really have anything better to contribute right now  maybe pixiv stuff again soon
and its done a go gos tarantula in pixels  again full version here      and i cant actually post an extremelysafeforwork version as my isp seems to have been rangebanned from posting images  well i can post it once everything works properly again also the full versions more interesting anyway    oh and i received a new delivery in the drawthreads a few hours ago cant repost that one either right now sadly i guess i could link to it but lets keep that for the next bump
  well lets see whether posting images works again 
  hey apparently it does  so heres the newest delivery from the drawthread as well by plaidsleep    guess ill go back to posting pixiv stuff when its time to bump again unless of course someone wants to discuss something
okay pixiv stuff some honey
  /m/ is moving fast right now close to page 9 in just 8 hours  bumping to be safe
    high heels  another thing shin did right original too iirc
  original too iirc  if youre talking about the cutie honey costume yes that has relatively flat heels in the original just like in the manga that kisaragi honey untransformed wears high heels and so does misty honey  and the latters are quite extreme    honey in high heels got popularized by flash which probably took that design straight from sailor moon the way mahou shoujo looked had changed quite a bit over time  and in the end its more of an aesthetics thing id say that when your heroine is a robot you might as well have her fight in impractical shoes
  the autism that radiates of this post is strong im surprised you didnt add a uwu
  uwu is reserved for weebs not autists
  that post is not nearly as autistic as seriously replying to a post thats more than a month old and obviously ironic uwu
remaster when   with english subtitles 
  was this popular i played it but only really enjoyed the campaign as the free play was a massive grind
  honestly very good it just felt right to me the ms felt a little floaty at times and the wepon charge function could have been done away with but it felt pretty good to me though im a little biased because my dad got it for me when he went to japan on business and he knew i loved gundam
  it was at the time but looking back at it i dont think its actually good
around the time crossfire gets a remaster
za gureato debato
  misa  minmay   but  die
minmay a best  misa a shit
which one is used goods and which one isnt
  there is nothing to debato gureato is and always will be za besto
  shammy
its complicated    dyrl minmay did nothing wrong its just happenstance that misa spent more time in a much more stressful situation with hikaru grew a stronger bod and thus won    tv minmay started out as a selfabsorbed shit at the end of the series she had selfactualized and matured into a great woman the ideal waifu hikaru basically admitted though that at that point minmay was so great it would be wrong of him to tie her down with a relationship by that point shes more of an ideal than a person misa is just a good fallback option
  dump em all there arent any good women in macross
  dump em all there arent any good earth women in macross    fixd
  grew a stronger bod  dohoho
  arent any good women in macross  youre shitting me
  theyre both used goods
but how would you deal with the recent incidents weve been under attack by mobile suits from gundanium alloy made in outer space these indestructible suits have the earth at a virtual crisis     what do the specials think you fought with them
  nuke them its the only way to be sure
    oz would probably pack a leo full of nukes then send it off since its not suitable for them unless its man shaped and physically intimidating only to have it trip over a pebble on its way out the hanger door and take the entire city off the map which theyd then put down to insurgent actions and form a new subsection of oz to deal with
  fill cargo planes with nuke leos and drop them on the gundams
but what about the problem with those mobile suits
  were discussing the gundam problem have you not been listening
  hey guys check out my new ms design
  wheres the beamsaber what are those red things on the left shoulder is it me or tis that torso a little small it doesnt look like the cockpit will have much room
      very interesting that would mean the disarmament of my military would have to be put on the back burner
  what is going on with that map behind you south america is far too the right
  some smart aleck spilled water on the map and we keep forgetting to replace it
  but its an lcd
  shh dont tell him that we lied because the lcd screens we get always suck
  who are we buying them from this is ridiculous if all of them suck this much
  china of course even in the uesa era their quality control is subpar but hey its cheap
leave those gundams to me
  give the gundams 24 hours to surrender if not youll destroy the colonies since the uesa is able to block communication between the colonies its likely that they can also stop that threat from reaching people in the colonies to avoid panic and riots
  gundanium can only really be destroyed by heat shooting it with a bunch of bullets wouldnt do anything which is why the leo was so ineffective
  then strap a beam cannon on it ala gelgoog cannon
  sir why not have spies learn who the pilots are and kill them via sniper please dont take the advice of those fools zechs and treize
  because weve already tried that commander why waste more vital human resources is any one else on board with my nuke leos plan
    better idea we spy on them find where they resupply and send the nuke leos there
  leo tommy guns are pretty baller
  tommy guns in general are pretty baller
  nyaa imma takin over dis here colony see
  whats that noi its a gundam
    leos had beam weapons too they were just really weak other than the commander version shoulder guns which could fire one strong shot followed by one very very weak one if they didnt take time charging up    that one there below the stockfootageintroonly bazooka is a beam rifle and they can also use beam dobers
  south america is far too the right  just like in reality am i right fellas rimshot
  not exactly remember wing selfdetonated but most of its armored shell just proceeded to keel over all manner of suits hit the gundams with beam weapons but they werent sufficiently powerful enough and at the same time they routinely took enough damage from ballistic impacts to require repair    when hero wanted to destroy both gundams how did he do it naval missiles he didnt succeed but he still messed them up and caused duo having nothing more to go on than witnessing the missiles knocking both suits back underwater to remark he knows gundaniums impact tolerance
  suicide a closecombat leo with a warhead theyll expect a normal explosion
  have leos commit seppuku by beam saber to confuse and distract them for a flanking attack
  just like in reality  cough venezuela cough brazil cough
  maybe heat is more important in gol  does tallgeese have a heatlance specifically because of that    it also seems that once the gundams show up mss start to use more beam weapons over ballistic but its been a long to to watch wing or read the manga
    the first ms weapon to deal more severe damage to a gundam was the taurus beam cannon otherwise there are a few instances where pilots exclaim or it is shown that theyve suffered minor damage from a direct hit like the bazooka that zechs hit the wing gundam with or the virgo beam cannon that didnt break the exterior armor but managed to put the wing gundams knee joint out of action crippling it
  dat filename
make them fight 100 of these
  increase  the  forces
  sigh
  ughh
  sigh
why dont we just burry a nuke in a remote base send all our retard soldiers with the oldest batch of leos and then quitly let it leak that we are developing antigundam mobile suits in this location then when the gundams show up we just remotly detonate the nuke and then let the media scream how the gundams detonated a nuke on earths soil
  thatd be too obvious the gundams would see through the plot easily
      
  sigh
  that bunch of retarded teens hah they will not be able to resist this bait plus we can always put out some extra rumors about us having recaptured the old scientists that made the tallgeeze that will be sure to lure them
  instantly explodes
time to give it up
  
  why was his dub voice
  what are you talking about  his dub voice was perfectly fiiine
    its so weird to me that it came out this way as you can see in the op the lines he has are pretty normal and wouldnt even stand out as odd if they were read normally but not only did this guy shout basically every single line he did it while sounding like animal from the muppets    like you have to assume the people involved in this dub were humans why did none of them at any point think you know this voice doesnt really match this dialogue maybe we should try a different one the most forgiving explanation i can come up with is that it was some sort of injoke that they got away with sticking in the dub because hes a pretty minor character
  the entire suit isnt made of that special material i always imagined the armor was special but the frame it was mounted to could only take so much fantheories
  well anything is better than snobbishly looking down on the writers and assuming they didnt think things through
    the dub doesnt actually list a va for general septum if i recall from a thread a few years back so someone probably did it as a joke and then made sure their name wasnt in the credits just in case
  he knows gundaniums impact tolerance  that was a dub line heero wasnt trying to destroy the suit with the missiles he remotely activated the self detonation device and was using the missiles to set it off duo disabled it earlier though so the suit didnt go off
gentlemen were wasting valuable combat resources just chatting here
  valuable combat resources are you talking about our soldiers or are you talking about mobile suits
  areyoumskingfunofmeanon
  youre saying reduce the forces 
hey guys i stol i mean borrowed this design from some guys in japan what do you think
  i seem to recall a few times where leos with doberguns also managed to mess up the gundams and at least stop them advancing so high calibur weapons probably do have some effect
  writers are mostly retards though
  the leo doberguns fall into the range of pilot gets knocked around and the gundam seems to have taken some damage but its not really visible and really minor
  clearly a leo cannon armed with two dober guns on the shoulders is the right course of action
  ninety two million
  wing is ripe for many custom ms why were they scared of doing so
    ozs qc was a good bit better than the alliances then again they were the ones in charge of constructionand the coup
  i dont know man especially since the leo is easily the second best grunt suit in the entire franchise
  the best being
  zaku ii
  reminder
    i think its less fear and more a complete lack of interest on the part of the creators suzumura was interested in telling a melodramatic story not in telling a mech story whatever pressure sunrise put on him or his team for designs they were turning out as new units rather than variants which sunrise probably didnt care about the distinction if anything theyd probably favor it since variants may have been viewed as less salable than new units
  wing msv when
  this guy designed the leo
    the leo commander shoulder guns just need better recharge rates to be really scary first shot blew massive holes in another leo but an immediate followup shot only took the outer armor off an aires   that custom model is pretty fucking awesome though      at least the magenacs got lots of custom variants from gunarms to three different shoulder cannon variants in this one shot and i think another variant with a single shoulder gun in a different shot    i also always thought the sandrock should have had guncannon style shoulder guns like the similarly named uc mudrock gundam     wonder if i could make that in one of those virtualgunpla games
  isnt that just really similar to a tragos in walk mode
  and heres the magenac with a gun arm    i will admit to occasionally writing shameless shitty fanfic outlines for a setting that bashes ac and oyw uc suits into one setting thats mostly uc based but slightly less brutal
  we should definitely change the spelling to magenac maganac makes me feel this weird sense of disgust i cant put my finger on it
  i mean its pronounced maguanac
  leo is easily the second best grunt suit  made of explodium  windham m1 astray flag tieren genoace shiden etc etc  youre right about zaku ii though
oh my goodness
  really then how come they have a job and you dont inb4 you blame the jews
thinking leos are actually great    whats so good about them i mean they are uglier than zeons suits and even less effective    zaku vs leo    im sure the zaku wins easily omitting the pilot
  considering the leo can use beam weapons id say its closer to the act zaku or hizack
  leo has beam weapons weighs dozens of tons less and has better equipment
  leos have a cooler name so they win
    yeah i think ac grunts have dimensions in between late uc and early uc ms
  yeah just like they saw through treize using them to assassinate the pacifists in the earth sphere alliance military
  what the fuck was treizes problem
  muh honor
  i thought that was wufeis problem
  why do you think wufei was gay for him
  being gay is not honorable
  leaflet campaign
aries is the sexiest wing grunt
  damn straight it is
  or is it
      no its actually the tragos its sex appeal comes from the fact that its shoulder cannons can even tell gundams to fuck off
  poor tragos always gets forgotten
  i guess its too bulky for some though thats precisely why i like it
    t h i c c  h  i  c  c
  but hes just happy to be there having a nice time whistling          shoulder cannons are great and having multiple mobility modes with their hoversleds is even better
  the red things are a deployable beam shield like the mercurius had only this one can fight back
  the fuck you need goggles for when youre in a mobile suit  inb4 jdecker screencap
  uh
    they could work like the vfheadset in the turna and link with the onboard computer to display extra details and help with aiming or something theres not really any reason the regular monitors couldnt handle that even in the turn a but its an element regardless realistically theyre just included as a nod to wwi and wwii era pilots in open canopies who wore them to protect against wind and there was certainly no effort given in show to justify them or show them doing something like the above idea but you could probably come up with something if you wanted to
what
what
    chicken butt
what do you guys think of this
  the coloring made me mistake it for an anime girl from the thumbnail perhaps saber lily
    rg leo when
  alternate plan what if we just figure out what it is the colonies are mad at us for doing then agree to stop doing it the gundams either withdraw or they continue fighting allowing us to turn public sentiment against them even in the colonies    when their support dries up theyll cease to be an effective fighting force
  smallgeese
  i like it
  did anyone here that
  smolgeese
  damn it i considered posting this
super advance japan probably have something that could stop them
  forget the mecha where did they find four people large enough to be seen from space
  uh ttgl
  who was his fucking va his voice was ridiculous
  as far as i can tell he wasnt credited probably because the guy knew if they ever found out who he is hed never get work again    im curious to hear how comparatively normal septums voice must sound in japanese but not curious enough to download an episode
  gundaminfo has subtiled wing on youtube right now
  thanks i completely forgot that channel existed ill give it a look
put your kitsune up
  the moon landing was fake
waffles innit
  simultaneously skipping and pursuing leg day
  the breasts are way bigger though
  way bigger
hit too close to home did it
  what is gunit what is tiels impulse what is frozen teardrop
  i cant believe they did a gundam thing called gunit hahahahahahahahaha
  id better be patient then
  me too
  whats the delay on naruto and bleach
     what do the specials think
  i dunno how this guy survived every single gundam and never died
can anyone tell if this thread report is real or figment of schizophrenia all this gundam talk is not healthy
  what
  kuma
but for my money this is the best gundam series
  youre saying
uc baddies  german military aesthetic  ms are absolutely terrifying    ac baddies  french military aesthetic  ms blow up constantly    did everyone else notice this
  brits antagonists soon
  if a guy named mcgillis isnt british i dont know what is
if theyre indestructible why dont we emp them the inner frame and circuitry cant be indestructible
  analogue sir      military aesthetic wise though also thats more scottish  we all know how the scottish feel
  are you implying zakus dont blow up constantly
  continental drift my dude
  last i checked scotland was a part of britain
  thicc in all the right places tits thighs crotch pauldrons
  what exactly is beneficial about a thick crotch
huh
there are many things i would like to know
  protective of leg joints i guess
  so true
  does thicc joint mean good chest protection
  aint that the truth
  what
  what
  what
  it sucks being a fan of the zaku i i just like the way it looks better and made it my main suit in the ps2 zeon gamecant remember the name it was allot like rise from the ashes on dreamcast
  nothing to be ashamed of theres fans of gouf  gyan here after all
  by exhausting them a siege battle plan just hope they dont obliterate all the opposing units
  leos  aries
  gyanko posts here
bowsette
  gyan rosling
no not even technically
that up smash
shooting a man after throwing him out of a plane
  mercy kill
  at least he can talk
  he didnt fly so good
  ultra kill
  zeonic front      pretty good game
  man its crazy to think that they actually used to localize gundam games even on a dead system like dreamcast    i wonder why the fuck they stopped considering gundam is much more popular now than it is then
impressive
  very interesting     subtitle comparisons  
  an actual gundam wing web
  yeah
  no one seems to ever admits how impressive of a shot that is
  what was the point though like in what possible circumstance would he survive being thrown out of a plane    also if lady une is this good a shot how come she didnt win the war singlehandedly
  people have survived skydiving with parachutes that didnt open
  oh
i am pretty sure that river only kills people with swords
  is just a japanese map
hm
huh
heh
  indeed
im gay by the way if that helps
  
  i remember writing this incredibly good feels reading that someone cared enough to save it makes my day thanks anon
  he inserted himself into the literal illuminati as their primary arms provider using private military companies and then when their goals didnt align with his  that a willingness to defend your beliefs is necessary for beliefs to be tested in trial by fire in order to ensure that they are beliefs worth having them and that the people fighting for them deserve to have them     whats more is by keeping a culture of combat it pushes forward the idea of self agency that people must be in control of their own lives to take responsibility for themselves    he saw the coming change coming that the illuminati romafeller who exist as a portmanteau of new business and old family oligarchs would disregard this and that would mean that if people under them would never become strong enough to overthrow the order once it became complacent  so he installed himself in a position which would ensure this did not happen
  gundaminfo has subtiled wing on youtube right now    not anymore it doesnt
  people do sometimes survive skydives without their parachutes opening
  oh
  heh
  whats so funny
huh
  are those tallgeese legs on a leo body the proportions feel off
  considering the leo iv is a notsotallgeese it makes some sense
i want to do sexual things with relena
  relena darlian  who draws a picture of someone before theyve finished watching the show
  a lot of most fanart youll find are by people who doesnt have any stake in whatever show/game/whatever theyre supplying art for theyll like the character design and want to draw it
  hm that would certainly explain why so much fanart is just a picture of the character doing a generic pose in front of a white background
  she still goes by darlian at the end when she because the minister of whatever the fuck
  
    yeah but nobody would call her that unless they have only a passing knowledge of the show
  i heard an old wives tale about the producers being pissed off about wing gundam getting taken down on the first episode
septum  that part of your nose that separates the nostrils  with a voice like that this cant be mere coincidence
  probably but it bears mentioning that septum is also latin for seven which is in line with all the other number names in this show
  poor taurus i feel like its the most underappreciated wing suit i think its problem was it was associated with the mobile doll system mostly
ummm knack 2
    sure just like only people with passing knowledge of 0079 zeta and/or chars counterattack call casval by his assumed name
  thats different because he continues to go by char and even when he stops going by char he goes by quattro instead
    not really because relena continues to go by darlain too its the name she chooses to identify with just like char the only difference is that char uses it more on screen after its revealed even then relena only ever uses the peacecraft name when politically convenient if i recall which makes up a large part of the show but she still chooses to go by darlain afterwards
why does this thread keep bumping despite their being no new posts it must have happened at least a half dozen times now and itd probably have died a week or more ago if not for those bumps
      op really likes their thread i guess
  wonder if i can hit 500 by the time were done
each gundam uses the same attack patterns as could be clearly seen on multiple occasions  im not saying all other pilots suck but if boss enemy in a game used the same attack second time id easily be able to dodge or counter it
  poor leo he just wanted to more daka
  damn hes been going at it for over two months now also   777 days until avatar 2
  is avatar /m/ might watch it if so
  get to da choppah
  qt european princess falls in love with an edgy japanese teenager  but why
    must be the same sperg that made the virus buster thread id bet  anyway if hes refusing to let the thread die we can at least post logh reaction images
  septem is latin for seven  saeptum is latin for enclosure/fence/wall/floodgate/divider
sir
  very interesting
  because none of the later conflicts were a baoa qu tier gryps roughed up the argama but didnt sink it bright left after the nahel argama was rolled out and left beecha to be the captain and chars forces were more focused on making sure axis drops than they were taking out as many londo bell ships in fact another way to look at it is that none of the other ships bright has captained gained that high priority target status that white base gained purely by fighting the oyw themselves for the most part    thats not to say the titans and neo zeon are stupid just that by that point everyone had ace pilots in mobile suits so sinking flagships stopped being a big deal
  that makes sense
  did this va ever do anything else
  there are some who say he is now the president of the united states
  2 seconds of brrrtttt  explodes externally
  i wouldve voted for him on the basis of his voice alone this is the best presidente in 16 years
  you will never hear usa dub septum debate his opponents  i thought you tax policies were that waaay
  i can imagine her opponent with septums voice it sounds like gold
  what
  could you repeat that you were speaking too softly
  what
yep everyone but me sure is fucking stupid now if youll excuse me i need to crash this asteroid into earth
    what a bunch of extremely low quality posts    all pol is fag
  yeah
best way would be to equip depleted uranium bullets to a large aries force and throw a whole shit ton of leos at them to distract them as the aries do single pass fly by ground support missions
  this is the funniest meme i have ever seen    why is logh such a boon for humor
  
blah blah blah
  because he said he was gonna kill her and that made her wet
good ol fascist dictatorships
well thats cool but you dont have to be afraid to go harder
is reinhard dare i say ryo horikawas best role
  no because he was also captain falcon
whoa
  vegeta is still cooler
  vegetas a large fellow
  when turna reset everything after g gundam they had to cover a few holes in tue atlantic
  but i mean seriously like everybody seriously how are you supposed to survive against a threat like that im serious what should zeon do theyve tried everything even gunarmor are just blips   even in sheer numbers they get fucked over gaint nuclear laser canon one chick ruins everything like zeon just cant compete
  turns out general septum was one of their smartest guys which really explains a whole lot of things    however  zeon
  maybe its sd gundam generations and oz is working with zeon
  perhaps
hm
  monkeyland  this post did not age well
  ughh
  i dont think it was correct even back in august
  why not make your own mobile suits from gundanium how is it possible the world government is less able to secure a resource than some 5 nobodies in space
  i havent watched the series so im completely ignoring the underbearing plot of the universe
  check wiki  virgos were made of gundanium  fucking what i dont remember that at all
  nigger are you deaf thats exactly what they did
  it was a lower grade of gundanium so while they were sorta resistant to grunt attacks on the rare chance that their shields didnt block the attack the gundams gundanium weapons were still strong enough to defeat their armor    heres a webm where a taurus beam rifle is able to knock back and only moderately damage a virgo unable to penetrate through all the way
  wow i really dont remember grunts ever doing that well vs the mobile dolls maybe i should rewatching wing i remember thinking how stupid it was to suggest a dozen people are going to commit suicide to take down 1 mobile doll
  okay this is epic
  i didnt know that either  maybe cause the scientists made these two beautiful bastards that virgo is based on
  not really tallgeese was made of titanium alloy its never explicitly stated any nongundams are made of gundanium in the anime manga maybe
  the manga is one of those rare manga that actually goes even faster than the anime it is complete garbage and does not state anything of value not even the art is good
  remember thinking how stupid it was to suggest a dozen people are going to commit suicide to take down 1 mobile doll  well that suicide charge only happened once in the tv series proper and the intro of endless waltz inserted a few more suicide attacks just for the hell of it heres another webm where one virgo was knocked on its ass and another able to be shot down by a beam rifle      what are you talking about tallgeese wasnt made in response to the gundams it already existed before the gundams were even an idea as part of ozs next generation ms development lady une captures the gundam scientists and force them to make the mercurius and vayeate which oz refines into the virgo those suits are made of gundanium
  what are you talking about tallgeese wasnt made in response to the gundams it already existed before the gundams were even an idea  yes it was you nonce the plans existed it was the prototype it wasnt actually built until the gundams appeared as a means of fighting them    those suits are made of gundanium  where is that stated
    the tallgeese i was already built before zechs requested it it was just pulled out of mothballs since it was never nessecary before that point i think it required a bit of maintenance after its long storage too
  it wasnt actually built until the gundams appeared as a means of fighting them  what are you talking about the first time the tallgeese was shown in episode 3 its already in a hangar at the corsica museum collecting dust with its head detached and in a state of disrepair walker calls it a historical artifact zechs takes it away to have it refurbished for his use    where is that stated  official website guidebooks and the fact that the vayeate was able to tank a medium power tbr shot for a couple of seconds without disintegrating in episode 24 just losing quite a bit of armor instead bottom of this page scan from the gundam wing ms encyclopedia says 装甲材質 ガンダニュウム合金 which you can stick into a translator yourself
  hm
desperate
  so zechs was kicking ass with old outdated technology what a badass
  more than any other gundam wing is structured in such a way that older is usually better tallgeese and wing zero were both mothballed or in wing zeros case never built because they were too good and everything since then has been watereddown versions of them tallgeese is still a bleedingedge mobile suit if you can actually handle it the problem being that almost nobody can
    i mean turn a and greco are both about finding or building suits that are thousands of years old but still more advanced than contemporary technology due to social and technology stagnation or outright destruction ibo glorifies older suits too
  we counter with a new gundam of our own and start destroying colonies until they surrender
once the big zam is mass produced
    the gundams will have a slow ungainly unit they can destroy in record numbers
  makes you wonder why on earth they thought the big zam would be such a game changer
  the vayeates cannon and generator look so fucking cool
  have some more friend
  did they ever explain why the backpack generator opened    also i think vayeate being a huge dick in endless duel has made me substantially fonder of it than i otherwise would be
  i dunno it just does during the fight between wing zero and the mercuriusvayeate heero is able to use the vayeates beam cannon even though trowa is incapacitated and out of the fight because he can physically open it up and manipulate it
  it really does
also fuck steve king
would a quadrupedal mech be more practical for combat than a humanoid one    could have a lower profile/take better advantage of cover  less issues with balance no upperbody/spine  more distribution of weight  could still move with a leg blown off
  why dont you ask  that and well just post cool looking mecha instead deal
i mean big dog is a quadruped for a reason

its all shit     gundam  star wars shit  macross  moeshit  votoms  boring shit  mazinger and getter robo  mexican shit  brave series  transformers power rangers shit  code geass  pizza shit  patlabor  dumb police shit  logh  brainlet politics shit    its all fucking dumb and i hate it
  sounds like youll fit right in especially if you stick to a/z
theres so much cynicism about media on this board and on the internet generally and i truly dont get it if you hate all the media youre consuming get a new hobby or try writing/producing your own content    like im totally down with criticism currently writing a phd on new hollywood love me some criticism but a lot of internet chat about pop culture isnt even criticism its just this endless dirge of negativity and sadness and i dont get it
  if you cant find anything to like in any of those shows the problem is straight up you
  its just this endless dirge of negativity and sadness and i dont get it  its probably just people being driven mad by the inherent emptiness and blandness of pop culture combined with anonymity allowing people to vent more freely    doctoral degree in liberal arts  enjoy endless debt for nothing in return
  s probably just people being driven mad by the inherent emptiness and blandness of pop culture combined with anonymity allowing people to vent more freely    then do something about it go full mishima and commit seppuku after taking over the warner lot or something     doctoral degree in liberal arts    actually i got full funding and teaching while doing it so its been really good financially only an idiot does a phd without funding    tho also im a depressed tranny so planning to kill myself at 30 anyway lel
    fellow phd /m/an here fuckin a right cept for the suicide part    go r1 or dont go at all also never pay for that shit fucking never
  i guess were all looking for something that we just cant find anymore but were just too invested that its just hard to not care so instead of finding a new hobby and shows to watch or just looking for something else we just end up being jaded and cynical
weve been over this lads theres only 1 good giant robot show
  you forgot to complain about evangelion and gurren lagann
  youre assuming op is serious and not just a haha i was only pretending to be regarded  shitter why we have so many of those here now thats a question
  still the tranny phd anon has a point
the fuck are mods waiting to purge this shit last i checked low quality posts were against the board rules
  /m/ has mods
  the mods have forsaken us long ago
    star wars shit  youve either never watched gundam or never watched star wars
yeah im thinking that hes back
you will never see this in full in your lifetime
  good
  who the fuck wants to see duo be a deadbeat dick not even the whole president of mars thing washes away the shit he pulled on hilde
    for what its worth frozen teardop is not meant to be adapted as is it was more of a dumping ground for ideas for a wing sequel
  and nothing of value will of been lost
  not having more amazing twomix openings
  its a bad sequel
i just want to see those actual designs that katoki refused to show
  source
  they will show up in next srw alongside ibo because muh mars  plus eggkun
your

  o
  i dont think i want to
  rubber
  bungee
  is there a good translation id like to read it i like wing a lot more than i did when i first watched it on toonami
  no you wouldnt like to read it
  after hilde breaks up with him in mc0012 duo travels to mars getting into a terrible motorbike accident in mc0014 most of his limbs are fractured however he is aided by trowa barton once out of the hospital saddled with debts he meets hilde again who has become a librarian in the lanigreen republic after moving in with her he begins to work to earn money to fix his motorbike and proposes to hilde the two are married in mc0015 and he cuts his braid off    however he soon leaves again taking off into the martian wilderness when he returns in mc0016 hilde has become a nun at a local church orphanage when the priest of the church bequeaths it to them the debts of the church are also passed on to the two as their assets were shared in marriage  the brunt of which fall to hilde and so she demands a divorce from duo who has also incurred many debts he accepts the divorce but not before promising to help pay off her debts when he returns again in mc0017 next summer he discovers a child whom is also named duo maxwell and closely resembles him living at the orphanage although it is not clear if the child is his biological son or not he denies it aloud but inwardly muses that the child would have been born in the time of his absence after marrying hilde during this time he remains a close contact and ally of the preventers      he seems to have been training his son to take part in the upcoming operation mythos and he and duo are present for the reawakening of heero yuy from cold sleep him being the first one to greet heero upon his awakening he acts as support for the new pilots throughout the martian conflict    in the epilogue of frozen teardrop duo is elected third president of the mars federation with hilde schbeiker as first lady heero yuys adult clone alpha acts as his aide
  maybe in 30 years when sunrise needs some nostalgia bux from the west
are there problems with southeast asia and /m/ or is it just one poster
fillipinos usually arent looked upon favorably in the toku fandom they tend to be really cringy
  i always thought it was the brazilians
  them too
theyre like american teenagers except with a poorer grasp of english
theyre not so much problems as they are people we laugh at especially people like buddy paraiso
  why is it because if toku stars not getting paid for con appearances
  anybody got that pic of the filipinos reaction to super megaforce
tokunigger is looked as children because most tokushit was watched by children in sea
  singapore  retarded cannot think for themselves shit english  flips clingy cringy shit english  indos retarded cringy shit english  hong kong no longer spotted around here because china took away their internet good riddance
  what about thais
  clingy shit english but they make funny knockoffs
  what about the rest
  same person from that engrish gridman thread
  i run an after war gundam x shitposting page on fb and nearly all the viewers are phillipino
  dont you know witz dad was a mobile suit
everyone thinks its south east asians but they are actually australians
  i run an after war gundam x shitposting page on fb
  cringy  just enjoy it not everything has to reddit related to be funny
  op here  havent watched it beyond ep 1
  encik u tink sea can enrish one really is it don be bodoh sial
  based
  how exactly did they get to do such a decent ultraman again
  based
    everyone is always confused between indonesia and malaysia
well they recently got nanoha detonation screened on their cinemas so they are clearly doing something right
  that d180223 asshole is a prime example of a cringy retarded indo with shit english i couldnt even make it through the first 30 seconds of that gridman video he did with that md chaos faggot
  i like d180223s stuff
at least we didnt invent robotech
  you cant convince the vocanon
  to be fair the language is similar
big
  zam
  big xamd although for some reason its not included ditto mars daybreak    raxephon and earth engine are the same size  neat for some reason i assumed earth engine was bigger
  does nirvash x even get to do much in the film i actually like the design which is really rare for kawamori
  why is it wearing stilts what in the design necessitated that
so i guess the sdgo private server is up ive been hearing very small amounts of information through the day today anybody know anything else     i found this link s    i guess to make an account you need to email some chinese people lol i found this quote     no kidding not scam i have a lot of accounts that no one uses it you can go through my email account to contact me my email is 331402678qqcom  take this with a grain of salt looking for anons to confirm
im a fucking idot 
  i played it last night yes
  whats avalable right now i honestly dont feel like grinding for years all over againt to get my old units back
  up to capsule machine 24 then you can get a bunch of other suits on bp and buy s ranks and shit with just straight up points  not counting any blueprint drops that may be there
its sdgo just like i remember it takes a bit to get used to chink language through but otherwise the ui is pretty much the same
lumber gundam
this game comes out in couple hours and it looks pretty cool        for ps4 and pc
looks fun but probably something id play for a week or two before dropping it
  it has singleplayer so that would be enough time to complete it
post the most attractive shoulder mounted weapons
  shoulder cannons are the best
hello
  handsome but there is already a guncannon thread
i love shoulder cannons
all hail the king
and his majestys jester
what is more important length or diameter    also missiles
  forgot pic
  what is more important length or diameter    my gf says diameter
dont mount the cannon on the shoulder  have the shoulder be the cannon  also yell until you bleed otherwise it wont have maximum output
    mr producer the mic broke again
do these count
man sentai has some pretty great mechs with should cannons
  heres another one
    yuor of like baby because all baby have less than 4 cannon
  at least this time you throat isnt bleeding
howdy
the only throne design that i like desu
does a shoulder bazooka count
 do you guys watch dxd
    no
  b o o s t o  o  o  s  t  o
  why not scale mail is one of the few actually interesting things in the series
  you said shoulder cannons yes
  one of the few actually interesting things in the series  implying the series has very little things of interest    sort of answered your own question thing there chief
where macross
    your moms house
how was this thing supposed to hover and shoot the cannon at the same time
  maybe its a recoilless gun
  that son of a bitch im gonna shoot his shoulder cannons off
magna buster
  zeke space magic
  listed as a 180mm long barrel cannon usually they name it such if thats the case like with the guntanks 180mm lowrecoil cannons    the gm cannon has the guncannons legs solely for the issue of recoil and balance from its 240mm cannon if the dom cannon exists to compete with the range and effectiveness of the gm cannon then my guess is thatll have the same recoil and balance problem unless those thermonuclear leg thrusters are magic
  maybe it has some really good timing circuits on the thrusters so that they accelerate it forward just at the moment the cannon fires and cancels out the momentum change
  yeah sorry i got confused and thought you were responding no to scale mail in specific im not very good at reading these days my minds so foggy i think ive got something going wrong i need to see a doctor
  no harm done anon
the oigami from armored core for answer     its essentially a collapsible shouldermounted artillery gun
  i loved that thing wished they made a laser/plasma version
i like my shoulder cannons simple and effective extravagant is nice too though
  i really love this it looks like its from the 70s80s but is actually quite recent
  the heavy gundam unit line is great
the mk iii has somw swxy shoulder cannons
  maybe its supposed to act like a classic spg ie shoot and scoot
itt we post zeon ms and shit
gas the fed war of independence now 
  i feel this thread is transparently made by somebody not from around here
  what do you mean 
  i mean if op really wanted to start a zeon thread he couldve used an actual zeon related meme but the op image is not the character that racecar johnny guy hes not really from anything /m/ related at all but from some comic that got popular on /co/ for being ridiculous op couldve had the decency to shoop the uniform to something that at least looked like a zeek soldier but we didnt even get that its poor form
  this is just /pol/ shit posting since pepe is banned on sight if its used for an op in decently run boards
  lame it also sort of sucks seeing as this threads op seems to be a poor copy of a thread made in this exact vein with the same kind of title made a few days ago thread piggybacking
  this picture is retarded if theres anything analogue to a polish mercenary killing commies in gundam it would be a mercenary killing zeeks
  how dare you  my thread is original
  checked and sieg zeon
  what a fake zeon supporter get gassed filthy earthnoid
  i like how the artist just gave up when it came time to do the flags lmao
  yeah zeonism under gihren is more blanket totalitarianism wearing the aesthetic veneer of nazism you could make a case that its really more similar to stalinism hell the second neo zeon war starts because char pretends to be a posadist
  if you watched an anime with explicitly leftist themes and came away wanting to larp as the nazis who lost only half as bad as the real life ones then i think you need to get your head examined
  thats a nice colony you got there
  strange thread    but stillsieg zeon 
  we should try to drop another colony on earth maybe it will work this time
so much for the tolerant left
feddies fear the space samurai
  we must secure the existence of our people and a future for spacenoide children
this thread
  fuck off feddie
  its a covert way for people who identify with real nazis to larp as them in public theres a reason animenyc forbade cosplays of zeon and other similar groups
    imagine being totally unable to differentiate between fiction and reality like this
best suit  prove me wrong
  based and zeonpilled
sunrise did it again
thank you fukui youve done it again first you saved gundam after age flopped with unicorn and now youve done it again after build divers flopped with nt
  ww    isnt this the japanese version of lol
  yeah
  nips are obsessed with zeek uc news at 11
ucshit  of fucking course gunplafags are npcs
looks like aus really are the only thing worth following anymore
  they are the ones that fund this franchise so we can shitpost about it faggot
  yeah man i really hope they make a sequel to age
  i mean if it leads to a new restock of the gunpla
  i liked age it wasnt good but i enjoyed it while it aired at least
  lol fuck off the last au barring gbf s1 worth a damn was 00 and that was practically a decade ago
  npc  is this supposed to be the new cuckposting
  once again ucniggers eat up whatever sunrise shits on their plate
  where have you been anon  long story short npc is used to describe people that dont think fro themselves and just follow popular trends  ironically most of the people that used npc memes are in fact following a popular trend
  fucking kek at this walled garden of a board i really envy how detached you guys are sometimes
  its obvious what it means if youve played a fucking videogame once in your life im just flabbergasted by how one retarded meme was replaced with another like that     you want real irony redpill anyone who says that one unironically needs to finish the matrix trilogy and pay attention to the colonel sanders looking guy instead of tuning out the plot
  at least aus dont try to ruin already existing material so if they suck you can just ignore them
  except the first au which sunrise has forgotten about
  theres only been one good au since the turn of the century and it was just over a decade ago and shat its self in the movie
why does the z fly inverted in atmosphere but not the zz  also does the z have 2 sets of landing gear  im pretty sure i have artwork of it resupplying both ways
  why does the z fly inverted in atmosphere but not the zz  ask the artist  also does the z have 2 sets of landing gear  having more plastic with models means they can charge more duh
  its from an official artbook
  i love kondos painting and vision of gundam
  what does that have to do with asking the artist
  thats a zeta variant designed to be in flight mode msot of the time so the aerodynamics on it might be different the original zeta was not designed to fly in the atmosphere it was meant to slow down reentry but iirc when it flew it did so the normal way
  yeah the z gundam should have the flight characteristics of a shuttle at least in atmo
remember that episode when punkass kai conceals a spy on board the white base     this is after he deserts but as we all know he comes back and proves himself helpful so they have no choice but to let him join again but while he was away he meets a young girl who is providing for her younger siblings with money made spying for the zeon and by less reputable means she sneaks on board white base in exchange for a bag of money that she leaves to her siblings kai finds her on board he even knows that shes a spy but decides to shelter her because shes just doing it to care for her family and he figures it has nothing to do with him and if kai hasnt shit the bed enough already he convinces amuro to lie for him and doesnt make a big deal when he catches her contacting the enemy    the zeon attack white base and she feels responsible because she leaked their destination to the zeon she refuses to stand idle as white base is attacked knowing there are children on board in her eagerness to help and in her military inexperience she is flung from the gunperry by the missiles exhaust blast and falls to her death in the atlantic ocean    has an episode ever hit you this hard /m/ates bright noa was within his rights to have kai courtmarshalled but doesnt out of pity the guy has suffered enough the last scene is kai reminiscing what she said about how the world cant stay sucky forever and that her brother and sister will have better futures than they he shouts why did she have to die over the atlantic i never liked kai sure he is a decent pilot and engineer but he is unpleasant and disagreeable and he got so much worse when morale dropped under mirais directive that being said nobody deserves to lose somebody they care about or feel responsible for
  didnt you read gundamsan miharu totally survived
  im still watching the main timeline ill get to it eventually its better if she didnt though
the kids fates are even worse if some side stories are to be believed
  let me guess raped by feddies
  by titans zeerks and feddies at the same time
  i fail to see how it could have possibly turned out well for them their fate was made clear enough we didnt have to know it explicitly
  close basically spend early 0080s being experimented on then theyre pretty much lobotomized and turned into some of the first cyber newtypes and given the names one and two
  i expected nothing good for them but still what the fuck
  how awful awful writing that is to say was there any significance to it being those two specifically i hope the sidestories arent all filled with cheap cameos like this its uncreative and the writers will never run out of material if all they do is give a backstory to every civilian casualty and minor character from the main line of shows it was barely acceptable for origin to do it
  i except it went like  oh so youre relatives to that one gal that almost sabotaged the white base crew  cue oozing dark aura and grinning faces with no eyes
  i see what is this called
  iirc they were the test subjects for the prototype psychogundams in some side story that fleshed out fours background in origin theyre given a happier ending with sayla setting up a foundation for war orphans where they go to be raised
  in gundam san they keep accidentally making fortunes and get sick of the excessive wealth
  what would zeon accent sound like
  it sounded like mumbling in the japanese i too want to see how it was dubbed
    in the dub its vaguely germanic
    kai was never really a soldier he was always just some kid who shouldnt have been there in the first place i think he had a very good development arc with surprising depth for a support character seeing him in cameos in later shows always makes me smile
  this is now a kai appreciation thread post why you love the white bases number two ace
check your mailboxes i just got my copy of xabungle two weeks early time to go watch graffiti
  i got my shipping notice a short while ago gotta wait now
  you gotta love the op man its lit as fuck
  post pics of jetpack arthur stealing melon heads girl
        xabungle has the best miq songs
graffiti was fun obviously its for people whove already seen/like xabungle since its just a glorified clipshow i did learn that the tron episode didnt air in the kansai region because they had aired a baseball tournament instead      crap i was trying to find that 80s car movie that used blue gale xabungle in its trailer have some commercials instead         so from reading second hand about how graffiti tweaks the ending its always sounded like arthur romantically steals elchi but its more like oh hey lets go fix your eyes      hey you is so goddamn good
    whatever happened to mio these days anyways
  is there a full set of xabungles vocal songs somewhere these are really good
  heres the third and last mio song from the show      and its english vocal version       she had an album called mio miq perfect best that has all her songs from several anime series including xabungle
  eng vocal ver starts 2411
  crap i was trying to find that 80s car movie that used blue gale xabungle in its trailer  i only know majestic thunderbolt  
so is millie browns character gonna turn out to be the reincarnation of a mothra priestess or something
  we know she has a sister that isnt around anymore and she seems awfully drawn to the big fluff but i guess the whole thing could just be a red herring
the godzilla x mothra ship is going to explode after the movie comes out holy shit
the second coming of mothra  moth frontal
  yep this ship is gonna sail hardcore
what are some mecha series with a focus on romance im looking for something cheesy and sentimental to watch i dont mean love triangles just a guy a girl and a nice robot  pic semirelated
  fss the movie    guy saves the girl from a horrible fate is pretty simple    f91 had so much potential for a knight in shining armor deal between seabook and cecily
  orguss has a romance plot thats rather important
votoms for sure gasaraki might
  legend of the blue wolves
  gundam x eureka seven
  armitage iii  zoe dolores idolo has a romance subplot too but its of the tragic variety
escaflowne
zetsurinoh  ningyou tsukai  dyogrammaton
  macross 7 is about a mans love for his music
  i saw mars daybreak recently the romance between the two main leads is interesting and something you rarely see but i think the show is not as exciting as it could be
m3 sono kuroki hagane
seconding gundam x garrod and tiffa have the best gundam romance and its quite central to the plot
xenoglossia
daimidaler
    cheesy  08th ms team if you havent already despite the rushed romance its still one of my favorite entries      yes gundam x is extremely comfy in all ways including the romance component    ill go out on a limb and suggest baldr force also they just released a fan translation patch for it earlier this august and it honestly blew away all my expectations since it was originally an eroge you can find what youre looking for here too if youre okay with visnovels and having the opportunity of fucking your sister       zoe dolores  also a good suggestion incredibly sentimental and if youre a father probably especially so     theres also martian successor nadesico blue gender buddy complex kannazuki no miko and rahxephon incredibly pure btw off the top of my head
godannar
  zeta gundam  best girl won despite everything has happened best girl prevail at the end
  f91s relationship between cecily/berah and seabrook was more like two people caught on opposite sides of the conflict
there are none that have a focus on romance that i would call good except for the fss movie
the face and curves on these things should be illegal
  its obvious why noa was lusting over him so hard what a stud
oh no my gundam is having her period
  who is this qt
  alexander is so fucking sexy
  iirc brownie the most posted of the nyorobotics girls
i faintly remember these thick thighed white mecha model kits that were posted awhile back never remembered the name though
  perhaps the robots from power dolls 10/10 ryusei approved robothighs
  i wanna cum on those cheeks
  thank you couldnt for the life of me remember the name
  i was expecting the rest of them to look a bit similar or just as uh appealing
  not looking appealing  pistols at dawn
  look on one end youve got a cute busty bunny with a nice set of colors and panels on the other youve got spoiler battle fever /spoiler
  do you even clap
  never found her appealing to be honest too high on the furry scale despite technically not being a furry instant turnoff
  thats pretty hot
    i always forget how deep brownies designer goes
  remind me why these things had tits and a face when the equivalent were four eyed box faced cold steel tank mecha
  you are a man of taste
more appealing than any fag
  youre only saying that because shes got bigger tits than any fag
  not more tits
  he doesnt customize his smoll plastic girls    what are you a fag
   not being sexually attracted to battle fever
  so whats the context here
  niabot vs anti spiral versions of dai gurren i guess
  i see that you too are into pegging
  where is this from
      crossbone gundam
j9 griffon
  i dunno that looks a lot like astranagant to me
  i couldnt give a damn about transformers but the porn makes me like this one
  best choice  inb4 getting rekt by e5
  wheres the dick
posting best uc girlmecha
  sauce
  yeah im gonna need some sauce for this or context or just something to go on besides suit vore
  good taste
    it was just some oneshot pixiv stuff i found while searching for brownie
  returning to og when
  too bad shes taken
love this design
    is strike witches a good /m/ show how does it compare with panzer and haifuri
  strike witches is okay  strike witches 2 is bad  brave witches is good
we dont talk about these mecha musume on /m/ because eventually we get to infinite shit and cancoal
  pretty much what this guy says  movie is also on the fair end of ok i guess ending is kinda derp tho
  this every so often we have a thread of giant robots anthropomorphized as girls but eventually someone starts wanting post boat hoes or bringing up the show about animaleared lolis showing their pantsu and propellor boots
  brave witches is boring
so apparently eva is coming to netflix gundam unicorn is already there and thats the only gundam entry so my question is 0079 when
  gundam is hulu territory
    but anon that just isnt true netflix has said it wants to be the place for anime it will keep digging its way into that cozy burrow of debt till it has all the mecha hopefully it gets outlaw star next
  you sure that statement doesnt actually mean that theyre gonna make a shitload of live action animus
  it has seed wing 08th ms team andvictory  iirc
  i only torrent shit anyways
  im surprised they havent put any of the recent aus like ibo or 00 on netflix yet
    i suppose that makes some sense as their next content push since disney and warner are letting contracts run out and no longer willing to give netflix any of their stuff so they can run their own streaming service anime is less likely to run in to that problem between the variety of owners and japans happiness to farm anime out to foreigners for foreign distribution
    crunchy roll is gundam territory they have 00 wing endless waltz seed destiny g fighter build fighters build divers ibo and unicorn i just wish they would get all the old uc stuff torrents i know i have include 0079 08th and a bunch of ac stuff but i really wish someone would stream zeta or 80/83
  forgot to include zz in there
they might have cca on crunchyroll too i feel like there was another movie
why cant you just torrent it like a decent human bean
  my computer is broke atm also when it was working i had trouble finding all the torrents i wanted
the normies can fuck off
  the lack of uc stuff anywhere kills me the only ones carried are 8th ms team on hulu and unicorn on netflix     where the fuck is the original
  on bluray in my antiquated physical collection of media
on the topic on watching gundam im thinking about going back into ms zeta gundam i took a break midway though since they just kept going back and forth from space to earth and earth to space should i try and find where i left off and continue from there or just watch the compilation movies
    in italy it was added to netflix two years ago
  thunderbolt gundam movies hopefully
i really hat3 turn based rpgs but i tredged along and managed to get through picture related should i put my war boots back on for front mission 2 if i take turns attacking again i think my hair will fall out
gentle/m/en tumblr has both destroyed raw images and is now throwing out adult content in the next two weeks due to both of these stupid ass moves on their part it is time to start collecting /m/ related scans/official art and dumping them here we have a booru we can archive shit now is the time to do something
  sjw finally running the asylum
  why would you ever use tumblr for smut    in fact why would you use tumblr to archive anything
pinterest
  tumblr recently banned porn and lewd drawings  their auto flagging bot is flagging anything   they are literally making it a christian site
  a lot of newtype scans and similar official /m/ art was uploaded there
who started the one year war i have someone telling me that there was a false flag assassination attempt by the federation that caused the war and theyre citing war in the pocket i dont remember enough about witp to disagree
humanity started the war
     tswanlover    those fucking birds started it man you cant tell me otherwise
zeon started the war by gassing a colony and committing the largest terrorist attack in human history  the federation started the war by refusing to grant sovereignty to a state that wanted no part in it    in truth it was the dolphins
  i always knew it was those sea mammal rapist bastards
  land mass of australia is 52 of the total land mass of earth  dolphins gained 52 of new territory because of operation british  motherfuckers were behind it the whole time
  those bottle nosed bastards they cant keep getting away with it
  uh the federation did grant them sovereignty
  didnt they then also sanction them on a number of things sort of like the whole brexit thing
    its never mentioned in the animation and it doesnt make a lot of sense to place embargo a place capable of self sufficiency thats legally capable of trading with the other two major powers side 6 and jupiter anyway any such trade barriers would be a formality at best at that point and only really serve to drive prices up a bit rather than actively prevent trade
  they started a the bardot policy which was embargoing side 3 and also a massive army buildup for peaceful reasons which was obviously meant to attack zeon at some point
  pretty sure side 6 declared neutrality/independence when the oyw kicked off not before ill concede on jupiter though they did h3 deals with the ef which had lots more money they could use to entice the jovians to reduce business with the republic/principality
  actually jupiter was pretty antief leaning and gave zeon a shitload of h3    fucking jupiter man
  looks it up   they did   shit my memory is bad just to antagonize the feds
  why do these artist always make cool designs but are completely terrible at cleaning them up its not hard to do
  zanscare/jupiter empire is just them taking things into their own hands after neo zeons stopped popping up jovians have always had it in for the feds
    its never mentioned anywhere in any animation where as we know from the film trilogy that zeon were made an autonomous nation prior to the one year war and from the tv show that they could freely trade with both side 6 and jupiter the bardot policy is just databook fluff and doesnt actually make much sense given the above information since you cant blockade a side effectively and side 3s ability to freely trade with other groups means the embargo is just a tariff at best and not even one that directly benefits the federation itself but instead mostly benefits side 6 and jupiter        the film trilogy establishes it happened before the war after degwin calls gihren a hitler they talk about how preparing for the arrival of newtypes in a conversation thats not in the tv show before degwin rebukes gihren during which he points out that the federation made side 3 the first autonomous spacenoid nation and that he had made it a principality to advance zeon zum deikuns agenda it implies this all happened 10 years or more ago long before the one year war
    ah knew i had a webm of it around somewhere its actually just before degwin calls gihren a hitler not just after like i recalled it sounds like it even happened before deikun died too which would make it possibly 11 years ago
    ah my apologies you said side 6 and not side 3 according to fluff it only declared independence about two years before the one year war but theres no information given in the show or movies to my knowledge im not sure that makes a tonne of sense though because what is established is that riah is quite rich and has a thriving economy and can actively boss the federation around because the white base is scared to step out of line and even the zeon ships comply with orders only char threatens the mayor of the colony theyre on everyone else keeps in step with any orders they give and wont even fight till theyre out of side 6s territory it suggests a more firmly established and longer lasting independence than 2 years to me though its by no means definitive or anything
  outside data books all animated works prior to origin ova made it look like pozs war of independence with showing gihren having ulterior megalomaniacal motives about establishing a master race which would comprise the entirety of human race   i was hoping for the origin to delve more into this so what we know is that  deikun was a lunatic who wanted a war at a time when all side 3 had was just volkswagen vans   there is already is discontent among did 3 denizens over feddies being over bearing  deikuns kids unbeknownst to populace were put under house arrest and later experience many assassination attempts also what the populace never knew was the inner faction rivalry  zabis consolidate their power by turning the republic into a principality  feddies being depicted comically arrogant incompetent fucks mess up agricultural pods of a space colony which i hear in manga was caused by an asteroid  poz starts military buildup with military academy and shit much to the chagrin of federation which led us to zeek military academy kids taking on a feddie base full of drunkards after the aforementioned incident in previous point makes you wonder whether entire federation army were just booze drinkers  at this point whole thing looks like zeek wank to the level of getting pozzed but we should not forget that with secret ms project alongside arms buildup it was subtlety implied that poz were readying themselves for a war  origin stopped being pozzed after the colony drop episode  degwin was satisfied with peace negotiations but gihren had his plans  revil does pic related
  thus   revil did what was necessary
  actually there was nothing to stop zeon from dropping more colonies after the federations diverted the first colony drop onto expendable australia and the federation fleets were destroyed at loum
  look behind any uc conflict  jovians there  hmmmm

do i get to be the mommy
why 99 of arts on ilia are so lewd
spacenoid milkies
  probably because she dresses like this
  using a woman  top gun was a better recruiting tool for the navy than anything outside of war you want high recruitment rates make a homoerotic movie
  speak for yourself  i want lilia to smother me with her giant neo zeon millkers
can i have my own mentally unstable cyber newtype
  can they use psychoframe magic to turn me into a full frontal ple
so im treading through first gundam again and i got to girhens speech the best part isnt the speech itself its bright calling him out on his horseshit
if i join would i be able to have cima to take a dump on my chest while screaming at me that im worthless human garbage
  okay why did neo zeon dress like jrpg villains
  gross desu i like busty hentai girls but dont try to make illia what she isnt leave my mutiny committing gf alone
  that image set of purus gangbanging her
  the only games they had on axis was jrpgs do you know how many time we played ff729kill me
  because they were based and redpilled
  could you share it with me fran
    wow illia im not actually a cybernewtype stripper i just dress like one for work pazom
  illia  thats clearly chloe

  the most important post on /m/
  hot zeon sluts
  zaft needs you
how did we get from this      to that
what if the mobile suit fights were replaced with sex suit fights
  oh just because she dresses in outfits that she likes makes it right for people to draw fucking porn disgusting fucking japanese men
  to recoup support they had to get radical
  i came here to fix your dress code
  having most of your dependable soldiers getting snipe will do that to your forces
    youre someone who could be a mother to me
   neo zeon  in fairness most of neo zeon dressed like normal soldiers it was just the newtypes chara mashymere and illia that went bizarro and most of that was at the very end anyway illia didnt show up til then mashymere had a normal uniform during the first half of the series and chara well she was always insane really
  at least mashymere just rips his sleeves off chara goes full lewd
    out of the way boomers  this is current uc style now
  does neo zeon fund its activities by selling milk to the urban colonies
    she has the mortar headd feet      kickstarters and cryptocurrency scams
  kono pressha
  its fine cause zz haman looks retarded too
    cima is just a tired zeon cougar that needs good federation dick and/or pussy
  i wish he would draw something besides scat
  why do zeeks always get the best pussy in the show

  thanks brother
            zeeks would be into this shit
  im glad they censored her anus itd be too obscene otherwise
      my eyes
best girl its coming  she is basically marida but better  also hathaways flash has a lot of ntr so get ready
  another ple clone
  thats a boy
  rein aim was basically a federation ace who was being promoted as the second coming of amuro ray along with being the pilot of the penelope gundam    after his failure to stop hathaway his career essentially stagnated and he never went anywhere with it he never gained the satisfaction of shooting down the xi gundam
  fukui will turn him into a cyber newtype clone of amuro  just watch
  nope normal person    shes a pretty girl
  so mrfukui why they clone amuro but in rule 64 version  why not  genius
  fate stay nightjpg  its rule 63 anon
  oh so then hes actually the second coming of jerid
    fine by me ive always wanted to fuck amuro
  absolutely he progressively became a joke among the manhunters and ultimately only got his win against hathaway due to kenneths minovsky net trap
  wasnt there a rule 63 char in an unicorn sidestory i think she piloted the rebawoo
      from gundam last sun 0096 manga
  so whats zoltans last name i assume alliteration is the norm for full frontals
  akkanen the guys edgy like that
  he aat least could have had the decency to keep the alliteratiion
  wish volume 6 could be found online
  now this is a better send off to the conflicts of the old generation before they give place to the formula wars and late uc than unicorn could ever be
  the fomula wars manga was surprisingly good
  i hope it is the next stuff to get adapted hathaways flash gives me hopes of the better novels and manga being animated
  formula wars   is that the conflict in f91
  th precursor it deals with the final embers of zeon a lone colony filled with old people and youngsters who never knew f the zeon and fed wars and the one centered on mars zeon where theyre finally snuffed out
    its easier to just say its the f90 manga formula wars sounds more appropiate for an inuniverse name for that conflict but from searches itll mainly just bring up the 1991 snes game wiki and manga ddl links      
can someone enlighten me on why is lane aime a bad person in hathways flash i thought lane aime was supposed to be the main protagonist since he is from the federation who that time is against mufti a terrorist organization   based on why i read about him through the comments in other forums a lot of people commented that he is a jeridlike character a piece of sht
  hes jerid in the sense that hes the rival who cant stack up to the protagonist otherwise hes a good guy that believes in the federation besides their faults compare him to hathaway whos pretty much just a white sandnigger all based on what i heard over the years anyway
  how i wished we get a series of ovas on the technological competition between the ae and snri akin to something we see in the beginning of macross plus when 2 different engineering teams trying to compete their latest valkyrie prototypes with their own respective test pilots to determine who is the reliable and effecient model    this setting sounds interesting to me as it shows the fall of ae and rise of snri
  i thought lane aime was supposed to be the main protagonist since he is from the federation who that time is against mufti a terrorist organization  technically at the beginning of zeta titans are federation special forces who fights aeug which is officially labelled as a terrorist group
  imagine a pseudodocumentary styled anime about the development and testing of tech from series like aoz or f90
  technically at the beginning of zeta titans are federation special forces who fights aeug which is officially labelled as a terrorist group  but is mufti a terrorist group that tries to accomplish whats right like the aeug or its just straight up bad
  on paper mufti goals of stopping the oppression on spacenoid illigals and some of the lower income sector by the manhunters is not a bad intention    its just the fact that hathaway was basically insane in his attempts to try and appease quesss spirit along with most of muftis largest supporters being war profiteers and neo zeon radicals it ultimately led to the group doing some highly questionable things from attacking civillian airports in melbourne to burning much of adelaide the ground to slaughter the federations congress
      iirc their goal is to fight against the effs new policy that bans certain undesirable people from stepping foot on earth and theres basically border patrol on earth hunting down illegals    the issue is hathaway is a retard thats actually only in it because he has a boner for the newtype ghost of the mentally challenged quess and is still trying to impress her
  how big is the tech gap between the penelope and xi
  wouldnt know never read the story the way gundam wiki lol wiki describes it they seem to be guilty of straight up assassination and have caused a few hundred civilian deaths      the msvr johnny ridden manga came close before it flung itself wholesale into the whole conspiracy plot and char/johnny wanking
  so basically aeug if aeug was ran by the titans leadership
  they are nearly equal in abilities the only diffrence is that the penelopes minovsky craft is built into an armor module while the xi gundams entire minovsky craft was built into it
  they are sibling units as can be seen from their model numbers they both incorporate the same tech but the penelope is a bulky machine that is a combination of a slim gundam that has a lot of additional equipment attached to it while the xi is bulky to begin with but still more compact than the penelope and has all the tech integrated into its body instead of being addon equipment
  the effs new policy that bans certain undesirable people from stepping foot on earth and theres basically border patrol on earth hunting down illegals  are they also building a wall and making the spacenoids pay for it
  they get taxes and they could make a orbit spanning defense network through said taxes so yeah
  is it an appropriate comparison to equate them with the vmax from layzner odysseus has the addon while the xi has the builtin version
    bananaxmarrida produce a child
  theyd have to be some sort of iron womb clone to be born because marida cant have children   tfw no marida coing and singing her baby to sleep while banana hugs them both while being the smaller of the two    would it be a case where banagher is still with mineva but marida asks if she could have his child
    marida deserved better
so is going to be yet another feddie wank in the footsteps of unicorn
  audrey asks marida to move in with her and banana so the child isnt left fatherless
  on paper mufti goals of stopping the oppression on spacenoid illigals and some of the lower income sector by the manhunters is not a bad intention  i wonder how does the laplace box incident from unicorn actually tie in into the current political situation in hathways flash
  083 does something like that only the competition is between the gp units all designed by anaheim
  when was unicorn written/published i have a feeling fukui didnt read hf befrore then
  most likely puts the federation even further on guard ecoas is most likely rebranded as manhunters hathaway has an easier time gaining supporters from the disillusioned on earth due to laplaces box being opened ect     the federation also most likely have a blood feud with londo bells leader bright noa due to his constant interferences in the previous incident thus making hathaways execution even more useful to them
  a young federal officer and mobile suit pilot for the circe unit lane is assigned the prototype rx104ff penelope despite having little combat experience he displays pride in his abilities however he is shown to be somewhat emotionally unstable after the mufti incident in uc 105 he was promoted to captain     the   wikia  makes him sound like a cunt pride  emotional instability are never good things mixed together in a gundam series
  is general revil a newtype i rmb seeing people commenting that general revil is a newtype according to the msg origin materials
  revil was confirmed as a weak but still notable newtype from multiple sources     gundam the origin  sd gundam g generation series  gihrens greed becomes a newtype at levels  original series implied it a few times  novelization notes him as being a potential newtype
  if anything unicorn gives the feds even more reasons why manhunting is ok who knows what other unique units like the shamblo are hidden on earth
  iirc some of the games like to give him the weakest newtype rank    i think its more that in a war where he was on the side that was seen as less technologically advanced and even somewhat backwards he had the most insight out of all of them and was willing to embrace the new and unknown and the white base is sort of seen as not just heroes of the federation but also as revils little pet project
    the biggest hint that revil is at least a weak newtype is in movie 3 where hes one of those the others being confirmed nts amuro sayla and mirai who are affected by lalahs presence at solomon
  they call him the second coming of the white devil  unicorn 4 dagon tba
  manhunter is less antizeon and more border patrol earth    iirc the fed soldiers that rough up quess and her friends on earth in the beginning scenes of cca are sort of related to the group that will become manhunter
  ae didnt really fall since they still design fed grunt ms
  they have far less business and power than they used to and dont develop as much new tech as they used to
  thats just banana is red hair
  how big was the manhunter group i mean its not that unlikely that someone who had there at torrington would sign up to get some revenge/prevent another remnant attack
    dont they eventually come back and build the victory types when zanscare gets uppity
  think of it this way post hathaway ae is post dreamcast sega theyre around but far from genesis glory days
  i wonder if they will give hathaway a happier ending getting executed feels bad man even bernie went out in glorious battle even if he ended like overcooked meat by beam saber    i say they should at least let him die in a blaze of explosions inside the xi
  happy ending sounds like quess ghost saying he did a good job
  maybe itll be where in his last moments he beams an info package of all the scandals/crimes the fed had been doing far more than enough to get everyone in the govt in trouble except for interns and causing public trust to disintegrate overnight
  if they let that hack fukui near it hell have quess show up and say  its sad isnt it hathaway  then hell lose or give up before banana and company show up and save his ass because it doesnt matter that hes a terrorist that fucked up earth more than the people he hates hes against the federation and that means hes automatically a good guy
  is the whole light novel translated
  dont you have somewhere else to shitpost
  that would be a good ending at least as far as tomino stuff goes still dies alone and unloved mocked by the ghost of the girl he loved but at least reveals the shady as fuck shenanigans going on    also would be a better end for bright who laments his sons death but at least it had some meaning to it rather than be accidentally executed under his own orders
  ergh just realised itll just be like unicorn gundam perfectibility
why all the pessimism it is that likely it will be horrible butchered to fit in the shitstain timeline that included unicorn    i expected it to mostly be stand alone as hathaway from flash would have some issues emerging from the horrible version he got in cca
  say that to fukuis blue destiny only with triple evil feddies and zeon did nothing wrong unicorn rewinds time
wait fukui is directing it oh this is going to fucking suck fucking let me nuke japan right now
  you dont deserve this you but here it is you filthy slut
whos dick did fukui suck to get so many damn jobs when he isnt that good wait japan  never mind
  no they havent announced any staff yet
  yeah its well known that the average japanese male femtopenis is so small as to might as well not exist so who did he go down on indeed
  someone mind elaborating on what he means by a lot of ntr
  gigi  mistress of some rich old fat man ends up moving in with kenneth but you should not be selfinserting as faceless old fat men
  i cant believe hathaway can go this far for quess as to oppose the federation
  fukui was a best selling novelist whose works were adapted into at least one hit movie who was then hired to write gundam novels which were adapted into one of the most successful post2000 gundam series    its not actually that hard to figure out why hes getting gigs
  what did he do before gundam what was his hit movie
  wrote milfics mostly    usually compared to tom clancy which either means hes big into the tech aspect of conflict or its an attempt at insinuating a sort of my country is the best jingoism    im one to believe the former considering how tech porn unicorn comes off as
  usually compared to tom clancy which either means hes big into the tech aspect of conflict or its an attempt at insinuating a sort of my country is the best jingoism    this claim is propagated entirely by retarded americans who have no fucking idea what theyre talking about    his biggest claim to fame is about a super top secret prototype super submarine controlled by a literal cyber newtype hes always been but what if newtypes and ideon though

  should have bought from japan so youd have the original packaging and easily identify and catalog them instead of blank box recasts
    that looks way over the top to even consider buying
  wait it actually comes with the flight unit finally been waiting to get one in mg and its the red dragon variant to boot
    looks nice but so expensive
just about done with the modifications im scaling the xamel to 1/20 and making it an ai autonomous tank
  it does but i think the chink 3rd party flight unit looks better i have it on my regular pbandai red frame
  its not exactly the same regular flight unit  the side plane wings are replaced with those 2 caledvwtch thingy on the sides  is this release similar to the mg turn red where its pbandai in japan but regular release everywhere else
  whered you buy your bootleg at anon
  gundam central its a nice build desu but you will need glue treat it like a tank model or a hasegawa kit and youll be fine   also theres no way this is 1/100 scale its way closer to 1/144
finished my regult after months of sitting on the bench i drilled out one of the missiles and inserted a plastic tube like it had been fired small thrusters were added to the legs and i used plastic tubing to replace the guns muzzles
  i like this alot weathering is a bit heavy but the overall results are great
  wow i dont even care about the red dragon shit i just want the shield and backpack
  i think the guy was going for the heavy weathered look considering what those things go through during the show and those little extra videos
  i figured from the series that the zentradi kept using the same machines without fixing them until they fell apart so they should have 100s of years of damage
    then i stand corrected great job
parts arrived although it doesnt fit perfectly out of the box it looks a lot like id pictured it not sure ill actually put both cannons from ryuseigo on it because just one looks armored core enough for my tastes    after all im calling it gundam lost raven
what ever happened to builders parts system weapons   how come bandai stopped printing these bad bois
  what kit is that    fss kits are hard to distinguish for me
  engage sr3 from wave 1/144 scale
ive been slowly working on the acks kiryu over the last week  the shape and proportions of the kiryu is great the build process is a nice change from the usual with bandai kits and theres some unexpected under gating on quite a few of under armor parts which is nice because theres a lot of surface detail with wire parts and such i have a few gripes but nothing major some nub placement on a few parts like the neck armor and forearms a bad seam line on the arm cuffs and and that the lower hatch of the absolute zero cannon had to be sanded down in a couple places to seat properly when closed    pic related is current progress still in the assembly and nub removal stage
  fuck yea kaiju
  thx
  shit the pack actually works quite well considering im dropping eins built in shoulderguns these work as a replacement now to solve the booster problem
  i like the concept
/m/ i want the best 1/100 astray red frame normal not kai and money isnt an issue  should i get the metal build or the hires  pic is the metal build    is it just me or does the hires have abnormally oversized legs
    very nice im seriously considering buying one for myself as a christmas present especially since they keep showing up very cheap on mandarake at the moment does it have a full inner frame kind of hard to tell from the promo photos
  there is no reason not to get the highres over the others it looks ridiculously good without much work
not so huge
  only partial the forearms chest heels and head arent the neck and crotch are abs parts with rubber parts around them
    nice even though its not a total inner frame whats there detail wise is enough to give a lot of nice painting options its enough to convince me to pick one up
  what a shitty clusterfuck design
about last time question about photos and display base  you guys actually suggest doing two photos with and without model and cutting out display base basically the only program i have to that is gimp but it would mean losing image quality    but is it really that bad and ruining everything to have clear display base visible on photo the only other option i see is to use claw holder instead of ass holder but it will still be visible especially on 1/144 model    i really tried to make good stuff with lighting and such and all i got was scrolling down all photos and comment its all shit this clear part at its back ruin everything
  in my opinion theres two schools of thought 1 incorporate the base into the model by painting it up to look nice or photoshopping the base out which relies on your photo manipulation skills if your goal is to do a photoshoot of a diorama then removing or incorporating the base is essential if youre just taking clinical shots of your work then the base should be minimized but can be largely ignored
  its a shame the picuters are this hard to see beauce of the photo quality but the kit does look pretty nice
    im not really about doing diorama yet but i wanted to make interesting poses with basic background that was going to be ignored anyway something i posted here     in such case i dont really see how could i hide the base
  just to remind you that  in the next replies the shitposters are probably gonna get you   btw the xamel is a unique design one of the few ground suits that has a weird design you commonly see in mobile armors shame that bandai wont make new kit based on it so we could talk about it
  thanks but im used to the shitposting if you like this mobile suit i say get it its a fun build
  the only program i have to that is gimp but it would mean losing image quality  thats not how that works    also buttrods are perfectly fine youre dealing with toys after all
    even if i would set 100 conversion without cutting size it still look worse    plus i would need to apply same adjustments to two photos each time unless im missing something
  what a fucking clusterfuck holy fuck is this garbage
so i think i might go with this color scheme because i can never get away from purples lol but at least its not blue
  i think that pink is a bit too bright
any recommendations for long range mobile suit kits i was just looking at mine and realized theyre all close combat
  id start with pic related
  verka narrative when
  hows the kit ive been meaning to get a mobile armor for a while now and the narrative might just be it
  obviously a pic from twitter
when tf is the qubeley damned supposed to ship i thought it was being released late november
is it true that this kit is piss yellow the side pics on the box show a more transparent gold color but ive read otherwise
  its been out in japan for well over a week    start living there instead of relying on shitty resellers
  that one specifically the gold coating ver is fine it was the first version that was pissyellow
  hi res red is best version of normal     the mg and metal build are too skinny with no over sized backpack because they were made to be the tactical arms variants
  the hg zaku i sniper is pretty amazing for a 2006 hg  nice details folding knee stand and even a braided cable connecting the rifle to the backpack
  still waiting on an mg of this hell even if its pbandai
  i used to think unicorn was more of a mistake than astray ive changed my mind
  bandai will never release an mg zaku i
  special mg  those huge fucking bandai seamlines    bravo
  whod you order it from  inb4 nippon yasan or usagundamstore
  nippon yassan is good gentei is the real theyre good when in reality they arent
why is preshading hated so much just straight painting looks so flat and boring
  because idiots think its maxxxxxx preshading or nothing also because probably less than 10 of this general could preshade well
  its just autism in the community some guy posted a youtube video saying that preshading doesnt do much if youre going to shade and weather it afterwards anyways and it started this whole debacle of extremes of preshading is a waste of time and preshading is absolutely 100 percent needed youre shit at life if you dont do it
since when does the astray have individual toes
  wow this is awful is this the hirez
  yup i dont think ive ever seen anything quite like this  look how wide the feet look compared to the mg even
  holy fuck lol i would have felt so bait and switched by this the other pics shown look 100x better than this the normal redframe is absolutely better than the hirez the feet are absurd
  did you fucken guys see fucken the pics of the new fucking p bandai red frame fucking holy fuck is it shit fuck
  those arms  shit dude
  i would totally let him fist my rear skirt armor
why is the bandai logo sometimes blue instead of red
  good for kicking toe funnels
  bandais model kit department merged with tamashii nations to form bandai spirits all new kits are coming with its blue logo as well as reprints of older kits so if you got something like a nu ver ka and it has a blue logo it means it was printed after the merger
  bandaionline kurama shop
  thats why i said normal redframe
how do snapfags live with the fact that their unpainted model will always look like shit compared to a painted one
making progress
  still cleaning the enamel wash then comes the decals weathering and top coat
  would you mind taking more inprogress pictures of your process and do an imgur album xamels my absolute favorite and ive recently gotten in ma k so what youre doing is bonkers to me
  not a problem ive been taking progress pics throughout the day which is unusual for me so youre in luck ill post what i have in a minute
  experimenting with asymmetrical design but im not sure i want to do a cannon on one side and the vernier on the other i have a central location i could mount the vernier    not sure what to replace the vernier with though
  xamel rescale project 
  what if and hear me out one huge arm on one side
  the proportions of it are kind of whack enough without making one smaller than the other imo i tried the idea by putting the old arm back on it but it just doesnt do it any smaller just looks weird
first build how do i improve
  but what if im both and dont have a preference i have some painted kits but also a lot of snapped up and panel lined
  your model is lightsaturated take a picture in the sunlight outside artificial lighting is usually bad for models unless you have a photo booth and have at least a rough idea of what youre doing
    by not having an obscene amount of autism like you while just enjoying their hobby of building their favorite robots
  just buy lego
  lmao i can tell that angry dude is a snapshitter
  why is preshading hated so much just straight painting looks so flat and boring    its not hated as such the thing with preshading is it makes the final colors look dull  flat compared to postshading much like mixing black with a color to make it darker also makes it look much duller  less intense than mixing it with a darker shade of a similar color    another reason preeshading is disliked by some is because people who have terrible airbrush skills tend to prefer preshading because it hides the fact they cant spray straight lines or control the brush well
told myself exactly 12 months ago id get into making dioramas  havent
  by playing with them mostly theres no paint on most of kits because i wanted to use them as pseudowarhams skirmishes and pose them aim them etc without fear of damaging the paintjob the poor gunpla ive painted get the shelf treatment nearforevermore and now that im reminded of them i should dust them the action bases are great for simulating space and elevation in a threedimensional area    its still autism but not your particular flavor of autism
  youve got lots of months ahead of you dont beat yourself up
  apply the waterslides
  wow i just finished my red frame kai tonight i almost had buyers remorse because the hires version got announced shortly after i bought it but some of those proportions just look way too strange to me like the massive duck feet    pictured the one i just finished went for a metallic red chrome leg/abdomen pistons clear black on chrome chest in practice i dont think it turned out all that interesting since i matte coated it the gray metallic sides are tamiya smoke which turned out surprisingly neat looking
  damn thats a nice effect with the smoke i will def remember that since all i knew about that color is you can use if for shading
    oh forgot to ask what clear red did you use for this and which gold and/or other paint you use for your golds
  you did it wrong youre supposed to start with hgs then work your way to an mg or an rg after a few kits read the guide
  mr color clear red c47 under the clear red is alclad chrome for the body and mr color silver c8 for the giant sword/backpack which is why they might look slightly different the gold is alclad pale gold
  you could start by painting it
  forgot to add to my post  since you were interested in the smoke as well thats after applying it to either the alclad chrome or mr color silver cant remember which metallic i used on those pieces and then i matte coated it but its still quite shiny even with the matte effect
  first build  really makes me think also stop using markers
  cant see shit captain
what are the best paint brands for handpainting ive heard vallejo is good but im not sure what else
  citadel if you can get it for cheap
  vallejo but the adhesion isnt great even for acrylics tamiya has an enamel line i normally avoid testors but their model master line of enamels seems decent      nice bait
  not bait citadel is perfectly fine its just too damn expensive because games workshop
    citadel is good but its made in such scummy way that it doesnt last long on purpose so if you buy it then you have very limited time window to use it before is goes to shit
  did they ever fix the bottle design where they purposely made them so they couldnt get an airtight seal so the paint would dry out even if it just sat on a shelf forcing you to buy more
    not that guy but i thought this was a meme until i looked up reviews and saw people complaining about their paint turning to sludge in the bottle
      are citadel paints made by grabblers
  gw  what do you think this is the same company that overcharges for plastic you dont know how good we have it with bandai till you take a look actually plenty of military scale aircrafts have been priced really well lately but fuck gw they upscale their plastic prices so high
  by knowing that they dont waste money on a part of the build that is utter tediom
  its worth it for its high quality
  you say this if other companies dont exist that provide high quality and welldetailed plastic for only a small fraction of what gw charges its worth it for its high quality with gw is a fucking meme and only reason its allowed to continue because there is no real model alternatives for their games
has anyone built any of pic related im really tempted to pull the trigger on 3  4 sets but cant find any reviews anywhere
  those look neat as fuck what are they
  yeah i got myself 1 set didnt get to play with it much but its pretty fun
  why dont they ever do the same gold plating from hyaku shiki 20    that was actually nice
  ive been working with vallejo for the last few weeks on a project depending on where you live and what the weather is like it can take a while to cure which you want to give it time to do because if you try and put down a clear coat and its not fully cured yet it will ruin the coat    and of course absolutely mandatory to do topcoating thankfully you get your best results washing it anyway so youre going to be putting at very minimum two coats on top of the vallejo color in any event
  those look neat as fuck what are they    i dont know what theyre really called but i found them on aliexpress searching for rihio multiabyss pic related is the contents of a single kit theres 3 different sets available and it seems from all the examples on that page you can make an awful lot of different mecha with a few sets    showz store has them too but more expensive
  wave 2 looks like a little titanfall mech too
weathering is done all thats left is a final top coat which i ran out of
  theyre very neat the accessories are more evocative than really detailed but once youve settled on an assembly of pieces you can add details to them yourself easily
  by taking pictures where we can actually see something on so we can then tell you what you could do better    seriously why dont people like you look at the picture you are uploading first surely you yourself should realise that you cant see any detail at all in this     also what are those thing in th top left if this is your first build
      im not sure if i like the ubbly texture but other than that it does look cool

  so did it end on the obligatory we gave up our powers because episode
  well they finished off the villains so the earth is safe but instead of the powers lost forever the nexus prism extracted back the ninja stars and flown out to space as its legend continues with a possible new team to fight off evil in another galaxy
what are your personal hopes/fears for beast morphers
  hopes  that its good  fears  that its bad
  with it confirmed that beast morphers is seasons 26 and 27 i wonder what the weird time on thenickelodean deal is about they made it sound like it was a 3 year deal
  hopes/fears  i have no hope since its the same writing staff of the last 3 years
  biggest fear is that since its gonna be the first season/seasons under hasbro that its gonna take awhile for it to find itd voice ao well get more shit like this 
  i hope that with the shift away from a school setting theres a shift away from the mediocre sliceoflife episodes that dominated ninja steel seriously not one notesworthy thing happened in the super season outside the anniversary episode and perhaps the still unaired christmas episode teamup the entire damn season was villain plots and questionable moral lessons    my fears are that itll just be more of the same
the same guy who wrote ninja steel also wrote lost galaxy a season that had slave camps and suicide bombers
  the suicide bomber thing was something he regretted almost immediately but really lost galaxy arent really any different in terms of structure lg is just darker
  dont forget the main villain murdered a child
  the still unaired christmas episode teamup  whats that
  preston and koda teaming up to fight sledge and poisandra alledgedly    
  i honestly want to look forward to this holiday episodes are normally clipshows but one of ninja steels few good points is that the three clipshows weve had so far have all been nontraditional and the halloween ones especially are actually quite fun    still ninja steel hasnt exactly earned the benefit of the doubt the odds of them fucking this up is depressingly high  best case scenario is blue ranger brothers teamup against fun villains worst case scenario its a fucking crossover clipshow
alleged hasbro lighting collection leaks     stay tuned
  would power rangers be better off under disney again
  i hope that with the shift away from a school setting theres a shift away from the mediocre sliceoflife episodes  didnt the casting call for beast morphers include roles as high school students
  fuck me i hope that shadow is real ill buy the entire spd figuarts to have that full team
  shit it did i thought we were getting government spies
  thats actually a pretty fair assortment love that magna defender and shadow ranger are going to be some of the first figures in the wave im curious on how the roleplay weapons listed are going to turn out      not that i remember unless they suddenly decided to pull a kim possible sometime during production
  it would be cancelled and forgotten under disney
  thats actually a pretty fair assortment  some people are complaining that theres too much mmpr but it honestly seems perfectly fine for a first wave to show people you know what youre doing
  too much mmpr  it is white would have sufficed limiting mmpr to one per wave would be better for the long haul you risk losing people once mmpr is complete
  its just the most recognizable girl a tommy and the most popular monster in the shows history   seems more like theyre trying to make the first wave a success then it being a straight pander
with transformers stuck at 7 am hell this is probably why hasbro pounced when offered to buy power rangers   i wonder what the ratings will be like on a season adults actually go out of their way to watch
  oh i kinda see what theyre thinking theyre gonna try and release these in waves where not everything looks exactly the same like the disaster that was bandais legacy line   wonder how long they can keep doing that without resorting to just doing more monsters
  adults are already a huge chunk modern kids care that little about tv
  yeah its like 50/50 now
man i know beast morphers is pretty much gonna have the same staff but i want to believe because hasbro studios typically puts out good stuff
  the most recognizable girl a tommy and the most popular monster in the shows history  too many heavy hitters too soon if they want this line to have legs many people will lose interest once they complete mmpr they really should have kept it to just tommy then maybe kim in the next wave and zedd after that boa blew through the mmprs in 3 waves and then couldnt sell the additional waves theyre so backlogged from unsold stock that the psychos that were supposed to come out in january are only finally starting to reach the us now
  maybe it is jumping the gun to put three popular mmpr characters in the first wave but most of your complaints are predicated on how hasbro handles the mmpr distribution in the next wave considering they managed to throw in characters only the larger fandom would want in addition to the recent reds im willing to trust their judgment so far
  itd be really funny if the second wave is like a complete opposite and its like mystic force operation overdrive and instead of another mmpr ranger its squatt     all in all im gonna wait for what they do for the second wave before i start doom saying little too early for me personally
i was struggling with making a list of good seasons since the good ones are good for different reasons so i made a twodimensional tier list not sure if these are the correct axes to evaluate or whether i rated each season correctly thoughts
  time force isnt very consistent and lost galaxy should be further left than any season
  how is rpm inconsistent even the episodes after guzelian left were good
was it ever possible to make justin work as a character or was he always doomed to be the annoying kid ranger
  zeo should be higher
  he already worked in the second half of turbo and in space
  dino charge should be higher then overdrive and samurai
  but none of that redeemed his character in the long run people still see him as the annoying runt who replaced rocky even after weve gotten worse rangers over the years how would you have made justin work in the first half of turbo
  time force isnt very consistent  how so its a pretty uniform season throughout in terms of writing characters and pace except for maybe lucas being useless  lost galaxy should be further left than any season  yeah i wasnt sure where to place it im not sure its more inconsistent than something like wild force though which has fantastic high points and atrocious low points    how is rpm inconsistent  aside from the obvious tone shift halfway through i always got the feeling some characters were extremely well thoughtout and explored dillon ziggy dr k while others were completely irrelevant and uninteresting scott flynn even summer to an extent so its inconsistent in the sense that character development and depth are inconsistently distributed im not saying the episodes arent good in fact its tied for second highest in my quality rating    and of course this is largely beyond the seasons control but the suits and zords do not fit thematically at all    zeo should be higher  in terms of quality i dont think it differs significantly in production value writing or acting from mmpr or turbo it just stays more centered on that equilibrium point so its harder to point out any distinct flaws it does what little it does well throughout the entire season so i just increased the rating in that axis    dino charge should be higher then overdrive and samurai  youre probably right about samurai but is it really better than overdrive the writing and acting are pretty awful in both oo and dc but its a difficult comparison to make since they are bad for very different reasons maybe ive just grown to hate the modern highschool setting because of neosaban but i think oos premise and overarching plot are more interesting than dcs even if let down by execution
  the writing and acting are pretty awful in both oo and dc  i just like the characters more in dc
  i never actively despised any of the dc rangers like i did overdrives cast and besides the teamup episodes what were wild forces fantastic high points
  time force suffered from uneven character focus dropped arcs and censorship though some people like the ending even chip lynn himself has critcized the character logic involved and also the filler episodes are atrocious    besides the crossover episodes wild force is a pretty standard slave to the sentai series it does get so bad its good though in the merrick/shayla focus episodes thanks to their acting
  dont forget that godawful animus arc
  dropped arcs  what dropped arcs did time force have most of the characters were resolved pretty well jen realized she couldnt see alex as a boyfriend or even a friend anymore and broke up with him eric loosens up and reconciles with wes ransik learned the errors of his ways and gave up i guess lucas katie and trip didnt get much development but time force didnt have any dropped moments as obvious as scorpina disappearing or zedd and rita usurping mondo as the main villains at the end of zeo only to disappear before the turbo movie or who the phantom ranger was supposed to be
  justin wasnt an annoying kid at all and was an upgrade from rocky
    fair enough i dont think dcs characters are good enough to warrant moving it up much but in retrospect oos are pretty awful so i guess ill move it down a bit  and besides the teamup episodes what were wild forces fantastic high points  for starters i think the villains are criminally underrated the zenaku arc is one of the best sixthranger arcs in the entire series that alone makes it pretty memorable theres also master org who has a wellwritten and original backstory giving him a personal connection to cole and a reasoning for his actions besides simply being evil and wanting to destroy things just because even jindrax and toxica have backstories motivations and a redemption arc i guess you could attribute some of these things to gaoranger but certainly not the dr adler story    i also really like how every power upgrade almost always a zord has to be earned by organic character development as opposed to rangers alpha has developed a new toy go fuck shit up i think only lost galaxy and jungle fury do this better maybe mystic force with its dank threeparter    and of course the teamup episodes are hands down the best in the entire series    obviously wild force also has some pretty glaring flaws such as the inconsistent tone the cheese overload and complete lack of selfawareness the cringy roboknighttier environmental message princess shayla and of course the kite arc however i dont think these elements drag down the series all that much things just sort of balance out in the aggregate making it a pretty decent but inconsistent season its certainly among the most remembered among normies at least from my anecdotal experience which i think is saying something
  wild force is a pretty standard slave to the sentai series  does this lower its quality though just because it adapts the sentai closely doesnt mean its a bad story i dont understand the obsession pr fans have with radically changing the source material some of the more beloved seasons like time force and spd are pretty faithful to the sentai while others like lost galaxy or rpm are nothing like it of course theres awkward googletranslated sentai scripts like samurai but on the other end of that spectrum you have turbo and super megaforce i dont think theres much of a correlation between originality and quality     more to the point with wild force it obviously doesnt deviate all that far from gaoranger however like spd the few changes it does make are significant better original villain better ending arc etc
  justin gets too much shit he wasnt a bad actor and it was just jarring that he was a little kid rocky started out very shitty but got pretty good by the end of zeo
  turbo had a ton of problems repetitive bomb plots writers had no idea what to do with tommy and made him a race car driver for no reason and justin was an easy scapegoat for all of them in the eyes of fans
  justin worked just finehe was functionally identical to rocky in most regards if anything he was actually more interesting in the dynamics he brought to the team ive never found him annoying and i wasnt even aware he was so widely disliked until i saw all the spergs complaining about him on the internet turbo had a ton of problems but justin wasnt really one of them          this
  it doesnt make it necessarily worse but more consistent inconsistencies in power rangers are usually the result of misunderstanding or misusing the sentai      time force is remembered as a series very close to sentai but it wasnt always supposed to be that way the beginning was quite ambitious and the original concept even moreso lots of elements indicating a different direction from timeranger it got forced more and more into the timeranger mold as it went on sometimes by external factors the themes not present in timeranger often seemed incomplete or contradicted lynn often laments the written by commitee elements resulting in the show making less sense and how little it resembled the original intentions
while its the sentais fault i dont like how wild force was the start of the mom get the credit card era where instead of just three or four zords there were now dozens and instead of figuring out how to do pull new tactics with one zord they had five other zords to do the trick even from a marketing standpoint i didnt get it not even the most doormat parents were going to buy that many megazord toys for their kids i especially cant imagine parents these days willing to buy 200 worth of power rangers toys that are ultimately gonna get stuck in a basement or public storage area
  but wouldnt they treat it better with the success of the mcu and the crossover potential it has
  because they dont actually own it completely its clear they never cared for how toei still has some control
  no the mcu hasnt sparked any reinterest in disneys other superhero properties otherwise wed have already gotten sky high 2 at the most theyd just repeat some old mmpr episodes on 4 am at disney xd
    it just seems more like theyre lamenting lost concepts that never saw the light of the day right after the mostly original opening two parter time force was already making pretty direct sentai adaptations    the only big inconsistencies is how off some of the original na filler feels compared to the rest of the show
  i wish more seasons would hack up and complete rework the zord footage the way season 3 did so they didnt accumulate a fleet of megazords every year
  this moving justin from the old teams pet kid to an equal with the new team already fixed the character
  writers had no idea what to do with tommy and made him a race car driver for no reason  the race car driver thing was be because jdf had checked out and they needed to explain him not being around very much outside of fight scenes he visibly doesnt give a shit during turbo i assume this was because saban tried to blackmail him into staying using his cast mates as collateral and he was pretty pissed off about it so he begrudgingly fulfilled the remainder of his contract in the most phoned in manner possible
  the only big inconsistencies is how off some of the original na filler feels compared to the rest of the show    though that movie 2parter though whew
  i never understood the choice to in a series called time force have a twopart episode involving the rangers going into movies of different eras versus i dont know actually travel through time and whats funny is that the opening credits use footage from it as if to say look its a show about time travel when its actually just anchored in the present 99 of the time mmpr season 2 had more time travel episodes than time force thats my biggest complaint about the series they didnt use the time travel concept at all beyond bouncing back from 3000 and 2000 itd be like if in space was limited to just travelling to the moon and back and even then they only go to the moon a few times
  a lot of time force themse especially make your own destiny and racism end up contradicted by what is shown on screen particularly because they ended up doing direct sentai translations in places they didnt want to
  mmpr season 2 had more time travel episodes than time force    ive never considered this and am now haunted by this fact the idea that legend of the clock tower and beware the knight had the most instances of casual time travel in the series is breaking my brain
dino charges finale was more time travel heavy than time forces finale
only two dinozords are actually dinosaurs  lost galaxy only spends a single arc in the lost galaxy
    timeranger had the same problem
  and didnt stop them from using the shit megaranger gave and turning into a proper space themed series
  it was easier to use some different color lighting on a quarry and say they were on an alien planet than actually build sets that look like a past era not to mention all the giant monster fights
  every single giant battle took place in a modern city that was what forced them to scrap all the actual time travel plans
  and yet they used such sets on getting sucked into movies      that means nothing the entire series could have been the rangers chasing ransik through time and sending monsters to the present could have been his way of getting the rangers off his back when they got too close because using bill  ted time travel logic the clock never stops in silver hills
  sending monsters to the present could have been his way of getting the rangers off his back when they got too close  but that would have gotten tedious after a few episodes of we were just about to arrest ransik when he threw another fucking monster at 2001
trying to make carranger serious was a big mistake
  less tedious than a time travel series which doesnt do any time travelling
  yet making goonger serious worked what did sloan/tzachor do wrong that guzelian did right
  except carranger is supposed to be parody while goonger is lighthearted
  rpm completely removed what it could and did remain toungeincheek about what was forced to remain    turbo is mostly just dry it tries to play things that are obviously meant to be goofy straight
  neither is an intentional parody they are both supposed to just be sillier sentai but with completely different styles of humor
  carranger was unique in its nature due to being a sentai series that is portrayed as a parody of the sentai genre itself  neither is an intentional parody
      how was goonger not a parody
  goonger is a lighthearted fun series while carranger is straight up parody
  unsourced wiki excerpt    akibaranger is what a sentai parody looks like carranger is a surreal and comedic series but notably the plot itself is played straight it works as a normal sentai its surrealism can even be considered a precursor to abaranger
every scene with eric after the point he was supposed to die is awkward as hell like the disposable characters in until dawn if you have them live
  because guzelian aimed to make a kids show tribute to mad max and terminator that stood out from previous pr seasons sloan and tzachor aimed to make the same show they were making for the past four years
  later i found out they originally wanted grace jones a fierce model and disco star  so when she didnt work out i was lucky to get the audition  grace jones would have made a cool power rangers villain but i couldnt ever picture her as divatox she looks far too serious compared to the divatox actresses we got
mighty morphin power rangers 36     writer marguerite bennett    artist simone di meo    cover artists jamal campbell phil murphy linda lithen    the newly assembled power rangers put everything on the line to win the battle but now a war has begunand its one they never anticipated but if grace thought her new team had time shes wrong  the universe itself is collapsing    32 pages 399

  explain what this chart means because no fucking way is gen 4 comparable to overdrive
chances of black drakkon figure 0
    yeah im going to need definitions  you could make the ultra/super season argument for literally every generation that has a sequel which is all of them yellow crystal emerald platinum black/white2 ultra sun/moon  why lets go its just nextgen remake of yellow isnt it its not some bootleg its just pokemon coliseum but an actual pokemon game and not some spinoff  are d/p universally reviled platinum was great  are black and white surprisingly mature high points i remember a lot less pokemon to collect  was x/y just phoning it in  is dino thunder full of water and trumpets
      ogs have their issues but overall good starts  the follow ups seemed great at the time but as years go on more flaws became apparent  the experimentals a lot of new fun ideas but some didnt work out  the bumps in the road while theres a lot of things that are great on paper execution was spotty and the product wasnt well received platinum excluded  the gift you didnt know you wanted updated the formula in new and interesting ways and seemed aimed more at legacy fans of the franchise  the revival made to cash in on nostalgia and bring back the fans unfortunately all of the fan wank in the world cant save an ultimately hollow product  the new blood allowed to try a few new things but feel like the production was just an absolute mess behind the scenes  the retry tries to patch up a couple of holes but ended up feeling like a retread while also bringing a few more problems  the saving throw aimed more at kids and wooing older fans with marginal brand recognition but ultimately souring the fanbase
  if boom comics raceswapped divatox and made her a grace jones expy id be 100 down with it despite being ginger whose people are being gingercided by hollywood for some reason
    so better off then
    whaaaat
  by that explanation last one should be the 2017 movie not some noname youtube channel  also dino thunder was experimental with a lot of new ideas fuck off with that noise
i would say dino thunder is the only season with a more mature audience in mind to any extent it was specifically courting those who hadnt watched since mmpr and incorporated online fan feedback
  xybrians  fiveman    stop my penis can only get so erect
  what about rpm  its the war against the machines from terminator minus the time travel  95 of humanity is dead  yellows butler and reds brother died and theyre not coming back  pilot referencing mad max and apocalypse now  pilot and second episode has our viewpoint character in prison
  phantom ranger gets his own cover  neat
  i think guzelian was just making it for himself it is obvious he knew nothing about power rangers and didnt care about the power ranger fanbase
  and he ironically ended up making something the fanbase loves
  what i dont understand is why hed name the leader of a group of machine villains venjix whos not in any way related to the machine empires venjix of forever red
  it is obvious he knew nothing about power rangers and didnt care about the power ranger fanbase  good power rangers should have more showrunners with fresher takes on the franchise    at this point i just assume both amit and guzelian coincidentally took the word vengeance and made it sound more like a monster name
  goddamit i want to die
  not really being nerdy fan doesnt make you a good writer
    any one read this story yet    anyone mind posting some screen shots of it i really want to see how supersonic green looks
  theres no not really in this argument rpm is generally considered a good season by fans just because you dont like rpm doesnt mean the rest of the fanbase shares your shit taste
  i meant its not really ironic
  that evolt turns up and masked rider build
  kinda hilarious now that hasbro is in the reins of pr reused names will make sense
  fiveman  not maskman and x1 mask  you were so close    that said its a little trite did we really need to know psycho green is a cuntier version of anakin skywalker
  trey moore isnt a very good writer pr fans just nut over his stuff because he fills it with references
  lets go is more of a back to basics charming but unquestionably flawed ninja storm than anything     gs as zeon works  rs practically killing the franchise despite improving over its run works well with turbo  dp reinvigorating the franchise before a slow stagnation even if the following games/series are by no means bad is about like in space    bw building off what dp had done while also losing some of the original pr feel fits with lg    xy being a decent game with its own strengths but forever stuck in the shadow of the previous two games fits well with lr    sm and time force doubled down on what made the previous set good and made a strong effort to improve the characterization among other things even if it wasnt always successful    wild force and usum feel like obligations there are a handful of neat things about them but not much that definitively puts them above what they followed
  hes had a good track record so far the finster and origin story was solid and didnt rely on references to tell a good story
  so is trey moore the john barber of power rangers or something
      yeah im going to need definitions  okay ill tell you     mmpr  gen 1   the iconic originals that people still remember and currently the one that gets shilled the most  zeo  gen 2   im guessing less popular sequels  dino thunder  gen 3   nowhere near as popular as the original and tried to return to the basics with tommy and fr/lg but its still highly regarded in the fanbase   operation overdrive gen 4  its shit outside of hgss and once a ranger  rpm  gen 5   the absolute peak of their respective franchise but were both commercial failures  samurai  gen 6   phoned in reboot and wasted potential  mf/smf  gen 7   lazy anniversary shit
  gen 5 a commercial failure  what the hell are you talking about it did well enough that game freak decided to make two third versions instead of just one
i guess hasbro will now have to start adapting all the skipped seasons or make their own original suits now
  why
  two third versions instead of just one  i think that was mostly because the 3rd versions always did comparatively poor in sales while the double sequels have had much less steep sales drop off from the originals
  naaaaaaaaaw
  unless news dropped in the past hour or so i guess hes referring to the fake rumor some asshole who wrote for a few seasons of power rangers started spreading that hasbro wont be allowed to use new seasons cause of bandai hating takara
  not that one the one rumor where sentai is endanger of being canceled got confirmed since the build trailer was released at the time he said it would be out
  hasbro buy the rights  source proceeds to get cancelled a few months later  haim king kike saban knew
  one doesnt confirm the other
  endangered   also  he  who  not to mention being able to predict when a trailer comes out means nothing a fucking guy on /m/ found out the final form of kamen rider w before god damn 2chan and all he was was a stage show actor
    a dude in krg posted a ton of screencaps from the new trailer earlier on in the day and mentioned the exact time the trailer would be released he mentioned that the new sentai is dinosaur themed and wont start until march sentai is taking a month off to showcase a miniseries with captain marvelous then he said itd be a four guy one girl team and that sentai probably wont continue if its not a success
  the leak from this person it wasnt just predicting the trailer coming out but also having images of that trailer before it would have been possible
    he mentioned that the new sentai is dinosaur themed and wont start until march sentai is taking a month off to showcase a miniseries with captain marvelous  if this happens ill believe it and its not like well have to wait long   just seems weird to come to us first rather then the japs who could actually do something about it you know
  probably true but thats literally all im asking for with these comics
smash ultimate leaks have shown me that successfully leaking one thing gives you free reign to bullshit about everything else proof only works for what is directly relevant
  he said in one post he thought it was cool westerners liked toku and wanted to share info
  yeah i read that and thought about how convenient that was in case someone asked why he was telling this to an american website not that that changes that japs would be better suited with this info then us   but like i said wont be long before we see for sure
  did anyone bother to check if there was some toei twitter with these images on them earlier today with a time announcement for the trailer
i dont think theyd consider canceling sentai until at least after the olympics
  japs are weirdos they leak pokemon stuff here all the time and most of it came true like rainbow rocket or the gen 7 final evo everyone kept saying it was fake when it wasnt
  my point was more japanese twitter or 2chan would be better suited for this information as theyd be able to do something about it unlike us rather then japs never post spoilers here   i guess if he was smart he wouldnt be risking his job posting spoilers though
supersonic pink is named star  supersonic green is named trek  i consider trey to be the best boom writer along with parrott but come the fuck on
  yeah at least be more subtle by naming them troi and riker or kira and odo
hasbro can release fiveman toys now  huh
  he was able to leak everything right so far
  it actually makes a lot of sense that the hasbro deal would put sentai in danger sentai is ultimately a combined effort of bandai and toei to sell toys and those toy sales have been bolstered by power rangers for the last 25 years now that bandai can no longer make money off of rangers outside of asia theres much less of a reason to keep it going and toei cant increase the licensing fees from hasbro to account for the losses because then there wont be any benefit to hasbro not just making the entire show in house     so sentai now has to be completely self sufficient and its been said at several low points in the past that power rangers was the only thing keeping sentai going there are still several years of sentai to mine but once that dries up we could be looking at 100 original power rangers which is both an exciting and scary thought
  i could see toei cancelling sentai and bringing back metal heroes in its place theyve been making so many of those metal hero vcinemas and crossovers throughout the 2010s that its obvious theyre chomping at the bit to make more of that series but dont have room to make three weekly toku shows and cancelling sentai would be their perfect opportunity to bring back space sheriffs full time
  its bandai america thats cut out the japan side is most likely still getting royalties/a licensing fee/something from hasbro    we could be looking at 100 original power rangers  thatll never happen too expensive too intertwined with toei
  but those werent selling well either
  its bandai america thats cut out the japan side is most likely still getting royalties/a licensing fee/something from hasbro  itd be toei getting any money from that i dont see why bandai would get it        shirakura in a recent interview actually talked about wanting to push an original series    metal heroes is essentially an empty branding they can use it if they want to nostalgia money or they might not if they believe a new show would be better off advertised as something completely new
  yes everyone checked 2chan 5chan and twitter these images were nowhere to be seen and no one was talking about this info
  this is the epitome of this is bullshit but i believe it for me
  will there be scans of this or somewhere to buy this story separately i always wanted tosee them adapt older sentai but i dont want to buy a 75 dollar 90 cad jfc book since ive been buying the trades      that wouldve made more sense but its probably a sly reference/joke to how gogofives power ranger version had 6 members now fiveman has 6 as well
  maskman would work better too since they all have those little symbols on their foreheads which could be akin to the xybrians crystals      a lot of tpbs get released on comixology which is how they get pirated online but this is an oversized hardcover so im less familiar with how thatll work but i dont think year one has been released on comixology and i cant remember if that volume had a special story in it that was later released in another collection    hopefully someone will scan it eventually or take crappy photos and upload them
  its bandai america thats cut out  bandai america is a subdivision of bandai namco power rangers and super sentai sales are factored into their yearly earnings as a whole losing power rangers most definitely effects the parent bandai namco and if they dont see enough of a reason to continue super sentai on its own merits toei has no other reason to keep it going the show only exists to sell the toys
  amazing right im all over this line if we get complete japanese teams and villians maskman liveman bioman changeman fiveman jetman the 80s and 90s were such a good time for sentai
  x1 mask  if a recurring boom writer doesnt introduce at least one original ranger they die  its how they live
  complete japanese teams and villians  well be lucky to get all the american ones let alone japanese
  wouldnt they have to be shoe horned in the comics at the very least for that to happen
  theyre all ayylmao teams because of super megaforce right so it shouldnt really be that hard to fit in if they wanted to use them
  i know right you can kind of excuse trek because of trip but stars just too blatant ill be shocked if the other supersonic rangers werent named wars fighter and control or is that pattern only reserved for stars boyfriends
  power rangers legacy wars  is it true that rj is playable
  id unironically get behind a team named after titles with star in them  trek  wars  control  search  shining  highway
  hes in  
    worked well for the flintstones comics
  except the flinstones comics were clearly made by someone who knows at least a little bit about what flintstones is about  its stoneage honeymooners fred and barney are war veterans who are members of a veteran support group just like their counterparts in honeymooners except its played completely seriously
  because of series fatigue and toei thinking kabutack and robotack were good ideas the last metal heroes show was twenty years ago while  might be right and shirakura wants to do something new hes also part of toei a company that regurgitates anything for nostalgia money a metal heroes show could fulfill both pander to nostalgia fans and be new to kids since they werent alive when an ongoing weekly metal heroes show existed
  if they still do the two seasons for series they can have adaptations for at least 10 years
  because of series fatigue and toei thinking kabutack and robotack were good ideas  no toeis issue with metal hero is that they were never able to find a format that had any longevity they wanted a third bfighter show but then kabuto flopped kabutack did well but robotack didnt its why there were always a couple of similar shows and then a format change it wasnt something they wanted to do
  what do you mean doesnt do time travel the fucking yellow robo fisted them and their equipment back in time to 2001 what would you call that their motif is clocks and clock hands plus they have the best suits
meanwhile in 1994  
  as christmas approaches a black market in power rangers has developed for certain scarce figures and play sets and some entrepreneurs are charging up to 50 for a pink ranger depicting the character kimberly that retails for 13 outside some stores signs have appeared offering the phone numbers of power rangers black marketeers    people known as diggers are patrolling store aisles filling carts with rangers they hope to resell and prompting some store managers to limit purchases    what strange times they were and yet familiar
  the guy is on record saying he hated flintstones
  you can know about something in detail and still hate it
  dat ass
  its neat how pr fans eat up these boring ass variant covers of helmets
so lose hope to beast morphers then
beast morphers toy listings
so i got around to watching the 2017 movie i liked it
no one talks about the mobile game
  who talks about a mobile game
  which one
well good thing hasbro has about 12 years before they have to make their own original series
  spd  consistent    oh i am laffin
  2 years of beast morphers  2 years of kyuranger  2 years of lupat  2 years of new show    please dont tell me you want hasbro to make toqger and zyuogher
  i dont they have a choicer if sentai gets canceled or if toei refuses to give them the rights
  if toei refused to give them rights they wouldnt have anything  saban didnt buy the rights to toqger or go busters he wasnt going to use them and didnt plan want to anyway hasbro had to buy the rights for go busters
  micro morpher zords  holy shit if theyre really bringing back the minisets boa did between oo and rpm i am officially a hasbro mark  red ranger powered up  wow were getting the powered custom figs this early  tronic  i can only assume this is our version of beet j stag
  the rangers make more pirate references in the turbo movie than in super megaforce
  try looking up supersonic rangers  see this    so is this shitty comicbook journalism again  fucking hell this is the same site that immediately thought gunns hint for a nameless movie was berserk
  it could just be a reference but well just have to wait until someone buys the book and confirms it
  supersonic came from the show years ago dumbass its what they said in megaforce when they transformed into fiveman    
  okay then didnt watch that much of super megaforce
  its still nuts to me this happened
what did you fuckers vote for
  after spd disney treated power rangers like a leaky boil they were literally embarrassed about the property and wanted it shelved and archived we only got rpm because the execs said whatever just dont mention that name around me got it its also why saban has animosity towards the disney seasons even though theyre a mixed bag and the only real stinkers are the post spd kalish seasons
  there were puff pieces for toon disneys rebrand to disney xd that acknowledged prs booting from the channel to the wastelands of abc saturday morning by calling the show tired and geriatric disney did not give one shit about the show at that point     its also why saban has animosity towards the disney seasons  that was mostly tzachor and amit and it had more to do with them still being mad that disney fired them
  zeo hyperforce green and ninja megazord
  jungle fury  stinker  hold your tongue you uncultured swine
  whiny manbaby red  three foot tall blue  the russian guy  couldnt settle on a main villain characterization until the last few episodes  it was a step up from the fireass show and the first anniversary mess but still sucked stoner ranger and the female cast were admittedly nice
  tzachor and amit  mr direct translation and the fandom senior entitled fanfic writer deserved to get the boot though both their philosophies were nasty extremes ninja storm and dino thunder remain leagues better than anything they couldve come up with in spite of their flaws
recalling that interview with a megaforce writer where he said tzachor turned down everybodys ideas except his own      speaking of amit here are his thoughts on the dimensions in danger 
the neosaban era wouldnt have been as shit if saban tried to find new blood for the showrunners hiring his old friends from the first era to run the show especially when tzachor and lynn dont have anything notable on their resume besides power rangers and a dtv movie here and there was a stupid idea that prevented the show from moving forward and it sucks theres little sign the hasbro era will change that
  bates ideas were all goofy if he had creative control then megaforce just would have been ninja steel before ninja steel
    lol of course amits a rocky is only zeo blue1 guy
  based
    ill never get over that massively halfassed half sun vulcan transformation    its literally the sun vulcan logo  then it turns into the mmpr coin  it flies to his chest where the sun vulcan logo is  even adjusts his helmet    just
  lost galaxy is honestly my favorite season how did a guy who wrote that season write this crappy one  that nostock footage episode where its essentially alien
  how exactly did the starship trooper uniforms end up in their prop department anyway
  same way they were in gsaviour  they made a fuckton of them for st and after shooting ended they sold them off some cheap productions were among the buyers
      firefly too
  its oddly appropriate for lost galaxy considering the villains are bugs
  who is that chick in the lost galaxy shot
  erin simms she was originally cast as maya before quitting/getting fired she wouldnt say what happened when interviewed but said she regretted losing her focus with acting and not being a part of the show she was apparently there for a month or two and shot several episodes
  halfassed is the megaforce show bible just like dumbed down was the samurai bible and milder than washed bag tea and soda crackers was the ninja steel bible
  huh the more you know
  lost galaxy had a lot of problems initial yellow ranger has to be replaced after several episodes were in the can requiring reshoots of all her scenes pink ranger gets cancer and they have to work around her often using doubles until theyre able to replace her with the previous years pink ranger after shooting a couple episodes the replacement pink bows out due to contractual disagreements and they have to reshoot her scenes and replace her with the previous years villain its amazing the season turned out as well as it did
  overall at least its a season of high highs and low lows the lights of orion/just copy and paste some gingaman scripts episodes are unwatchable
  its a bit rough but magna defender saves that arc for me
  thats a surprisingly fair assessment i was kind of expecting a little more vitriol      well its not like hes wrong zeo couldve used some sort of representation
what if power rangers starts getting dubbed in japan again under hasbro would be hilarious
  i was kind of expecting a little more vitriol  maybe because he has no bad blood or creative disputes with lynn the way he did with tzachor considering his presumably bad experience writing on samurai like when he wrote that redraft and went samurai would be so much better if i wrote it like this maybe he assumes ninja steels problems are due to lynns creative vision getting stifled
  no hes wrong
  after spd disney treated power rangers like a leaky boil they were literally embarrassed about the property and wanted it shelved and archived    why are they embarrassed
  because they couldnt make a cartoon out of it
aside from the lackluster series neosaban era has been one wild ride of surprises
  because they learned they didnt have full control over it when toei blocked them from making a cartoon
  yoshi minna henshin da becomes the standard morph call  beast morphers morphers announce lets henshin  i cant wait
so judging by bumblebee will hasbro make sure the next pr movie have a megazord look like the actual fucking megazord
  if and when we get another movie i think so
  not only will that happen but anything in the trailer that makes fans cry loud enough will be changed for full damage control
seeing how netflix is having an avatar live action adaptation and hasbro seems to be wanting power rangers to follow a transformers route appeal to all varying audiences of different ages what are the odds of them doing a power rangers netflix series for older fans and how awful would it be
  a current gen dragonzord
  zero a netflix show would be more expensive than the nick series for a fraction of the audience and merchandising they already have the boom comics and hyperforce for older fansat 1/10000 the cost of a tv show
  wouldnt toei stop them for breaking contract    unless that whole sentai is being cancelled thing is true
  that seeker and the others already had f15 airplane wings and intakes notice how different the shoulders and back cones and wings are compared to blitzwings so it was bound to be starscream eventually
  hyperforce  isnt that over
  now im curious what 10 legged dubstep playing monstrosity we couldve gotten if the movie didnt bomb
  they probably wouldve made it into some bayformers red dragon thunderzord lookalike
  the season ended
  is it coming back for more
  a fraction of the audience  the nick series barely even has an audience  be more expensive  a bundle of sticks is more expensive than the nick series  already have the boom comics and hyperforce  small pickings
  more children watch power rangers on netflix and youtube than there are even people watching nickelodeon period kids have moved to streaming and traditional channels are on their way out they just need a way to integrate the merchandising
i dont get how you can suggest power rangers should stay the same as it has for the past eight years thats not a winning business strategy especially when the target demographics taste changes a dozen times within a decade
  they havent said either way
new issue came out today it wasnt as bad as the last few or im getting used to the shit  
  rocky fans will always be 2
  rocky fans  does such a thing even exist
  how she got her powers  holy shit thats the stupidest thing ive ever seen
  or im getting used to the shit  yeah its you  the writing and characterization is still shit  the story is boring
  i dont think saban understood recent trends honestly rpm was a step in the right direction
  that doesnt make sense either power rangers was successful under saban
  successful  but it wasnt the movie bombed the shows audience is so small these days that people here didnt even know ninja steels finale aired until some guy mentioned it
  power rangers is one of the most watched shows on the childrens channel with the most total viewers what the hell are you comparing it to power rangers is currently the largest action figure brand in north america this place has nothing to do with the franchises success
  the childrens channel  nickelodeon has a name you know that right and its not even one of the most watched its only in 14th place 
    the shows audience is so small these days that  its not even the one of the most watched    it does better then you or that chart from 2017 give it credit for see  theres lots of power rangers fan sites complaining about power rangers only getting a million in ratings or less not realizing that the rest of the vast video wasteland looks like this all around for kids entertainment   it charts like this constantly lately and if it keeps charting like this tv itself will die before power rangers current sentai rumors not withstanding i doubt hasbro is going to do anything that different but itd be nice
  this anon who always shows up to mention how successful power rangers is and shouldnt need to change  are you a saban shill or was ninja steel somehow your favorite season
  hes half right the new tmnt is now the largest action show for kids in north america currently   i guess power rangers is the largest live action one
  no but you guys always use faulty arguments for change usually suggestting the exact opposite of the truth
  not if its still adapting a series or based on a previously existing series      or even worse turn it into a mechanized wyvern
  power rangers overtook star wars marvel and transformers in action figure market share in 2017
  usually suggestting the exact opposite of the truth  but it is the truth the movie did bomb and youve given no links or sources to suggest the toys are still selling well if the franchise was still successful why is it being sold to hasbro
  what are you talking about  
  the point is that none of the other kids channels approach the number of viewers that nickelodeon gets every single one of them loses chuncks viewers every year however
  that just indicates their failure not prs success
  i dont think it was in 2018
  yeah for success youd probably have to look at something like this   what the fuck is henry danger
  action figures npd      the is no precedent for power rangers movies being big box office hits hasbro bought the franchise because it was successful you cant go and say everything should be like rpm when rpm is the most obscure season of the show
  action figures npd  and wheres your evidence for that because all the links i can find show that power rangers is nowhere near the top 10 best selling toys 
  i think he meant  power rangers overtook star wars marvel and transformers in action figure market share in 2017 in storage space
      bandai kept bragging about the brand growth
  the is no precedent for power rangers movies being big box office hits  once again what are you talking about the 1995 mmpr movie made 4 times its budget
  on a smaller budget it was not considered successful as it made their future movie efforts more difficult 
  if the franchise was still successful why is it being sold to hasbro  i imagine to that guy its more if the franchise is so successful why shouldnt hasbro want to buy it  but no its bandai of america lost the toy license because they were shit garbage hasbro ceo has been friends with saban for years and always tried to get him to let hasbro make the toys and then hasbro bought the whole thing either cause saban didnt wanna bother and felt safe giving it to someone hes known for years and it wasnt a kiss situation or hasbro really wanted to expand their media brand because they know mask isnt gonna get them anywhere   and lets not act like the first part of what i said isnt widely known and has been repeated in threads constantly this isnt a hasbro getting the dog scraps of a dying franchise situation
  that brand growth seems shortlived because npd also claimed the highest selling action figures were beyblades  
gobusters getting power rangerd   do you think toqger will get anything
  if sentai dies yes  if not maybe not
  as it made their future movie efforts more difficult   how when the turbo movie came out less than two years later the turbo movie bombed but the first movie still did well enough to commission another film
  honestly they should kids/autistic people love trains and making new molds for collectable toys for pr seasons would be easy
  and yet cerina vincent unironically did a perfectly good job    and is somewhat selfaware too of how unimaginative her character was and the way she had to portray maya
watched samurai/super samurai last month and now watching shinkenger i didnt realize it was that literal of a 11 copy for most of the episodes still thinking back i dont think samurai was that bad     the actors were pretty wooden but that wasnt their fault during those handful of times they actually got to act they werent so bad could have probably thrown in a few more japanese characters other than mia though and is saban aware there are other japanese surnames besides watanabe other than lauren being underused antonio being far too spanish jayden being the most wooden of the rangers and xandred drinking cups and cups of medicine was it really that bad especially considering what follows
  the turbo movie was completly in house and not a studio film
    xmas preview
  and what does that have to do with anything youre being pedantic
  wait cassie was going to replace kendrix initially thats interesting and it makes sense considering the emphasis they made on her for a few episodes do you have a source id be curious to read more
  who was the original yellow ranger
  yes its why the space rangers were helmeted up when saying goodbye the scene originally played out much differently and was reshot after the fact with the stunties this is very old info that was known when the series was airing so just google it and im sure youll find a hundred sources
  it was legally a direct translation thats why unlike seasons before and after it the sentai episode writers got onscreen credits
            the scripts featuring cassie as galaxy pink have been online for several years supposedly they just did a findandreplace of cassie into karone on the other handful of scripts that were completed at that point and thats how we ended up with extroverted karone
  they couldnt get anymore hollywood films the rest were attempts by tzachor to get show productions released in theaters
  i like how its paced like a supercut but its not    also i swear i thought wes  was wearing a yarmulke for a second
  rocky became not shit in zeo i def went from hating him to liking him after rewatching zeo
fuck      100 proof that hasbro wants nothing to be different at the moment
  higest selling toy individual
    i liked the little time force referance also happy to see sledge again
soul of the dragon preview    
still no sign of psychotic scans anywhere i want to read this shit but no way am i shelling out for something thats 90 content i already own
  and there are already links on this thread telling you its not the highest selling toy not even close youre pushing your goalposts hard anon
  it is the nubmer 1 action figure brand and 11th toy brand overall you just cant read
  and yet the links in this thread contradict both of your claims unless you can find a link more recent than the one saying beyblade is the 1 action figure brand youre out of luck
  dumbass it was talking about specific toys not brands the number one selling individual product in that category was a beyblade pack
  the saban shill is seething
  and yet you still havent shown me any evidence that power rangers is still successful as a toy brand all youve shown is a year old link if youre going to plug your ears and scream that power rangers is still the juggernaut that it was in the early 90s go ahead but youre not convincing anybody thats the truth
  you have an extremely warped view of burden of proof we only have complete data from last year so that automitically mean power rangers is failing you cant possibly be that stupid
  so kat became a teacher too
  i never considered it but these fuckers would have completely messed up bodies as they age right
  i thought they still had use a certain amount of sentai footage or no deal
  jungle fury  ninjetti tommy  thunderzord
  you have an extremely warped view of burden of proof  if youre going to make these claims and refuse to back them up with sources of course anons are going to call bullshit  we only have complete data from last year so that automitically mean power rangers is failing  and you seem to be missing the point of why people here want power rangers to change they dont give a shit about toy sales or ratings they just want the show to be good again  you cant possibly be that stupid  werent you that anon in the last thread who thought turbo and in space werent tonally different shows
  noam was apart of the package deal there was nothing hasbro could do about that
  thats why i said adapting assuming they moved to netflix without too many changes to production otherwise they could try to fudge things by doing a movie based on another series then doing a series based on that but im no lawyer and without knowing the exact wording of the contract who knows what they could pull off      this doesnt seem too bad so far except for that generic hellbeast which hopefully theyll elaborate on      true i assumed ranger powers offered you a modicum of resistance to damage/aging but even they can only do so much
  what year is this supposed to take place it looks more futuristic than spd and tommy looks notably older but kat looks young enough to be her season 3 self
  you literally have sources your evidence to the contrary is literally just misinterpreting the same sources the power rangers brand grew in sales and this is objectively true you would have to prove power rangers sales suddenly fell off the face of the earth to have a counterpoint
  t turbo and in space werent tonally different shows  in space has several of the most comedic episodes in the franchise turbos final arc is bleaker than the entirety of in space and even most of wild force
  turbos final arc is bleaker than the entirety of in space and even most of wild force  other than the finale what about turbo was bleak
  the power rangers brand grew in sales and this is objectively true  or the 2017 movie led the toy sales to have a temporary spike only to go down as there have been no later reports suggesting the brand maintained its hold you seem to be under the assumption that the brand only keeps escalating based on only listening to a couple articles while refusing to acknowledge others unless you enjoy living in a delusion where power rangers is the most successful franchise in existence
  given the advancements id say its between 510 years out from spds 2025 which would put tommy at around 60 im just going to chalk kat up to artistic license or really good gene therapy given the times
so are these guys canon to regular uc
  first we need to define canon
  main cannon are the movies  side cannon are everything else   not cannon is zz and doozy bots because they arent anime
    an accepted order of events with the optional caveat that those events reference or influence other works within the same order
  so are these guys canon to regular uc  regular uc  canon    uc is a very loose canon to begin with m8 dont try to force isolated stories into their own setting just because the artist decided to get creative every ova director was given the same creative leeway by sunrise and basically did the same thing to varying degrees only exception is unicorn
  i still think the south seas alliance should have been the main villains in their own au without zeon
  canon  what tomino directed  side stories that dont make it awkward with canon retroactively  0080 08th ms team  side stories that do  0083 thunderbolt igloo  side stories/sequel that are raping canon gundam unicorn narrative
     canon what i like   noncanon what i dont like
  canon  what i like
    no one likes zz and victory but unfortunately theyre still canon
  thunderbolt is and will stay a au uc story
  still believing the zz is bad meme
  its easily the worst uc series
  the fuck is zz then
  moving pictures
     using noone as a synonymous for i    i bet you like tomino and are willing to include them because of him though if someone else directed them youd probably reject them as canon for the same reasons youre rejecting other animations
  buddhist enlightenment does fit the newtypes thematic but hard to believe theyll dominate the mostly islamic malayan nations and they seem more tibetan sect than thais
  it was until recently
  not anime
    the worst fucking idea
  doesnt the newtype monk guy bring the zeon scientist girl back to normal out of the mindfuck  newtypes being capable of that kinda contradicts what happens in zz at least
  no but one of them is canon to the third episode of votoms
  oh and obviously him being able to mind control thousands of followers into allahu akbaring for his sake would make him the most powerful newtype of all time by a milelong margin  as opposed to scirocco and haman who were established as top tier newtypes and who were able to only charm several people into their bidding
    depends on whether you view marias public perception and popularity as being because of her newtype charm
    implying this is not true  projecting this hard  stay mad tomino haters
  its real af
     implying i hate tomino just because i accept he doesnt dictate canon    you make yourself look more ignorant with each post
  so everything is canonaside from retellings and remakes suprisingly nothing seems to contradict anything in the decades amount of uc timeline main series spinoffsnovels mangas etc
  a toy commercial like every other gundam series
  its hard to say because thunderbolt has a different timetable in regards to the oyw and mobile suit development but then again origin came and fucked that up as well so who really knows anymore the general accepted canon so far goes 0079/08th ms team  0080  0083  zeta  zz  cca  unicorn  f91  victory this will obviously change with nt and the upcoming hataways flash trilogy but this is the order so far some people count gsavior turn a and greco but theyre far in the future according to tomino
  i think the more important question isl who the hell cares
  main cannon x 6  side cannon x 8  not cannon missile pods
thunderbolt and origin are both au versions of uc
  pretending to know everything about gundam is serious business around here
    pretending to be better than others for petty reasons is too
  08th ms team  not completely fucked  mountain destroying super mega particle beam cannon in a mobile armor with an ifield that didnt overheat deployed before big zam launched surrounded by gundam type grunts and special gm types that werent even originally deployed until literally the last battle of the oyw  08th ms team is literally one of the worst offenders of fucking up the timeline in all of the animated works
  hontou no koto saaaaa
    dont forget that even coming up on a century later theres no mobile weapon that can use a comparable weapon
  sure why not isnt this a supersmall sidestory
  its both bad and not canon   you better keep writing to tomino to make zz movies
  its a huge problem with basically any new story set between preexisting works  introduces new super amazing advanced ms or technology that they can sell a million toys of  it was never again used in later conflicts because shh shh just buy more plastic
  supersmall sidestory  they have china and india
  if theres a toy of their robots theyre canon  thats the only rule for uc canon
  does gsaviour count then cause it has an hg kit
  gsaviour has always counted because nothing contradicts it and sunrise doesnt give a fuck about late uc
  inb4 sunrise retcons all of late uc so they can create unicorn 3
  the author denounce any ties with the uc canon im afraid
  and then theres crossbone gundam
  cant read for shit  implying i said that tomino dictated canon  too dense to realize that much of the side story stuff is centered on world building and lore he did in tv series thus making it closest contender to a canon    with each post you making yourself look like a faggot
now that were down to one movie what does /m/ think will happen in eureka 7 hievolution 3
  theres 2 of them already
  hievo 1 came out in 2017 and hievo 2 anemone was released last month the last film in the trilogy comes out next year what month is unknown
at this point i dont think anyone can expect anything in this godforsaken trilogy the direction over the last two films has been so erratic and scattered that its impossible to predict what can happen    at this point i just hope the last film concludes in a way that we can finally move on from eureka 7 entirely hievo sure seems intent on putting the final nail in its coffin anyway
  im much the same frankly i just want this trilogy over with
bump
something completely unrelated to the previous movie
i predict that it will suck
  well obviously i think thats a foregone conclusion at this point    if dai sato actually did that and rendered movie 2 a red herring he will be the greatest troll in existence
heres a wild theory    renton will become a god and fix all the timelines so that charles and ray never die eureka never becomes the control cluster and dewey never attempted to start a war with the coralians
  so basically end of eva e7 edition
  pretty much    though lets be honest it cant be any worse than what pfor and ao did
  dominic dies hes designed to blow up and he doesnt seem to have any other purpose besides that and helping anemone
  what are the code names for the three films again i know this one was anemone seven and i think one was renton seven
  hievo 1 renton seven  hievo 2 anemone seven  hievo 3  no info on that unless we all missed it
    does the second have about as much original footage as the first expected something new from the 1st movie and got mostly a recap
  hievo 3 ao seven    how would you feel
  there is a thread you can view to get all the information you need     but no it does not have nearly as much stock footage as the first one i think its only about 10 recycled animation compared to the 70 at least of hievo 1
  i would be fucking livid and bones would never get my money again
  bones wouldnt be that stupidwould they
  something edgy involving eureka rape its the only way anyone will still be talking about eureka 7 in five years
  but what if eureka is doing the raping
  doubtful ao was a dead end creatively and financially for bones they are trying to go back to the original source material with these movies plus its a different writer
  eureka  rape    thats one way to get fans hopping mad and drive them away from the franchise forever
  doubtful ao was a dead end creatively and financially for bones    thats like the exact opposite of true comically so     why do you think hi evolution even happened
        oh boy  here we go
so what is dominic like in the movie personality wise
  again read the spoilers thread     hes not a person hes an ai program made by anemones father though when anemone dives into eureka seven really just the tv series universe he manifests as a real person personality wise i wouldnt know
  i knew most of that what happened to him being a smart bomb though
  in some respects he still is since he gives stats to anemone about the enemies she faces but its hard to say since hes just an ai     it makes me wonder why bones went for the alternate dimension bullcrap instead of just building upon the world and its lore
  no dominicxanemone makes me sad _
  its still a neat idea maybe he ends up having to blow himself up    my biggest complaint with the movie honestly
  why is it that dominic always gets the bad end in every adaptation after the tv series he dies in the manga dies in pfor and is totally absent in ao and now hes been made a fucking computer program    why bones why
  hey given that lonely guys are marrying their digital waifus today im sure 2028 japan will accept his and anemones love  also dominic app when
  its not the bad end anymore anon its reality the happy dominic was eurekas nightmare and he is robot forever jesus christ im so fucking mad
  evo2 is doing really well and people are calling it the best part of eureka seven ever      renton will become a god and fix all the timelines so that charles and ray never die eureka never becomes the control cluster  anemone already did that in the latest movie without his help    dewey never attempted to start a war with the coralians  hes now coralian jesus
    anemones movie already retconned ao it never happened
  ai dominic turns into a human at the end    anemone looks at him more like a surrogate father figure though
  sauce on box office returns    and even if it is doing good doesnt necessarily mean its good in quality
  the majority of people writing reviews and comments love it and its the highest rated eureka movie on all review platforms despite getting 1 star bombed by autists still whining about ao
  dammit at least hes ok with it
  she straight up thought he was actually her dad
i want at least some of this to become real
  not canon
  did that even show up in the movie
  what is ever going on in eureka 7    all ive seen was the first one and thats it
    rape is so hot right now
thats it /m/ were doing it    were going to have a warframe thread     right now    here    at this very moment  fuck the orokin
  you cannot have a warframe thread without this bad op    
   fuck the orokin   no objections here anon
  hows ash after they fucked with his ability to enter the facestab cutscene dimension for his ult    ive been debating whether or not to rebuild him on my run through a fresh start of warframe with the switch port i really liked the goofy way his 4 would work back during the mesa days
    need like a gorillion toroids to cosplay as a spoice mahreen    and i havent even started angling for the /m/fishes yet
    ashs ultimate is now more flexible to use as now his ultimate summons his clones to facestab his enemies you can choose to enter the facestab dimension if you want
  mesa mirage and ivara best girls it is physically impossible to prove me wrong
  what about  nehza 
  i dont like considering warframe as /m/ because what started off as /m/ elements early in the games life have been written into generic space magic as time goes on my last hope is held out for the sentients but i dont have high expectations considering the pace and direction their writers have been going
  ash is the strongest hes ever been period he can remain permanently invisible and outscales saryns damage in team compositions past level 500 or so probably useless to know but hey he has that blade storms changes help him a lot since you keep control and can focus on maximising your passive     what he said just keep in mind that joining replaces a clone with yourself instead of adding you to the count as a result even if youre doing no damage and just building combo counter seperately youll be doing more damage in blade storm than out of it    in addition he has extremely compact builds and a variety of them giving you the room for two augments or whatever you want his biggest downside is the manic farming really      cough
  still spaceships  grineer  corprus  guns  space stations  its very much still /m/
i really want to like wf its just between the time gated weapons and crazy amount of resource farming it just feels tedious not to mention the tons of levels on everything
  the farming is weird since it becomes easier the farther you go outside of resources ive never farmed before i can pretty much make anything i want
  levelling weapons is piss easy just play 15 waves of level 30 defense elite sanctuary onslaught or a level 30 excavation with a full party eso is the fastest when coordinated 5 minutes excavation is the most rewarding coincident grind defense is easiest
  its quite comfy if you get into a routine and apply the monhun rule of setting a target for yourself to grind for rather than doing everything at once     which ok fair enough it gets pretty crazy if youre like me and you just want a nikana to slap onto your space ninja due to the short list of prerequisites to satisfy but you can multitask progression quite well so that while waiting out a timer for one thing youre progressing on another
im tired of the soma and shotguns  what are some fun and good primaries
  if you want a rifle that performs better and has a bit more character try out the prisma gorgon supra/vandal zhuge prisma grakata stradavar tiberon prime zenith mutalist quanta nagantaka astilla or zenith    if you havent experienced the face melting properies of acid shells sobek or kohm try them    as for other generally fantastic primaries id reccomend  miter drakgoon mag ignis wraith amprex synapse ogris opticor ferrox secura penta torid zarr phantasma quanta vandal mutalist cernos cernos prime lenz vectis/prime rubico/prime lanka    its a huge ass list but this game has a huge amount of weapons
is this game fun
  motherfucker was thinking about opening a warframe thread but you beat me to it  anyway why is valkyr best girl
  i thought so for a while but the grind eventually drained that the gameplay itself is pretty fun
  its like speedrunner candy until you hit a speed bump and gotta grind shit out
      im back on the ride for fortuna  and its a bit annoying  i have to grind fish shit back in eidolon and purchase and manufacture stuff to be able to summon my archwing in fortuna  why do they have to overcomplicate things for stuff that i already have the wings are there just chilling in my fucking storage and i have purchased and made the launcher in the forge    anyway  i miss my facestab dimensional jumping  what do i have to do to go back at hopping in between joyous facestabs cause i want my facestabs  i dont care if im stabing one less guy
  just teleport in and join the fun with your clones
  archwing  did they ever make this less shit i admittedly only had the default equipment for it but those missions sucked hard
  archwing never got better
  damn it
  i thought you meant that there was a way to configure it like the old version  not to manually use the teleport skill and go stabbitty stab with the stealth kill contextual action  i wanted to use my forearm stabby bits
    different anon here if you activate teleport on a marked enemy while bladestorm is active you will join the clones and get the cutscene kills back according to the notes the cast of teleport consumes no energy although personally ive never gone so deep as to completely empty out ash/primes energy pool before so i never noticed whether the teleport does indeed cost energy or not in all other instances teleport will do the usual of opening an enemy to a finisher    you clearly have ash or the prime so give it a spin if you dont believe me      the ferrox would be perfect if the user could hold shots until required eg the lanka
  just use vile accelleration
  thanks  i will try it again later
  when you want to do limbo theorem but it means archwing    no ones touched it on switch from what i could tell and i cant fault them for it
  best trap if you see one in a miku colour scheme with a hek its probably me
  it takes all of 5 minutes with an unranked archwing set to grab enough beacons
  i remember seeing you   it is very cute 
  maybe im playing sloppy but the enemies feel way too damage spongey for a fresh archwing
i dont get why people complain that much about archwings  i know theres a bit of a learning curve but once you get it its like flying on cocaine
  been quite a while since i played but i vaguely recall being frustrated at enemies that were immune from a direction and damn near impossible to maneuver around to hit from a vulnerable angle maybe that got tweaked or theres some equipment that helps but on the fresh build i had at that time it was infuriating
    archwing has broken mechanics that let you be immortal and nuke everything but if you dont have those two archwings then your life is aids because de didnt think through enemy design    basically build an iztal mod it and youve made literally all current archwing content in the game a cakewalk
  oh  maybe thats the reason i like it  i immediatly bought a set of itzal wings  if i main ash  its just natural that i would get the stealthy wings and im halfway leveling it up
  its the opposite of stealthy iztal just teleports around nuking things the invisibility is almost completely useless unless youre exploiting pathing bugs
  itzal is less a stealthy archwing and more like a stealth bombercarrier archwing vanish teleport in and just start blowing the fuck outta everything in the immediate region the invisibility only works if youre using energy to teleport regular movement deactivates it    doesnt help that skill 3 cosmic crush additionally gives it the lootwing reputation like what mag got with greedy pull and to this day is still fucking omnidirectional too to boot the fact that 3 is a fairly damaging skill itself they can swap skill 4 fighter escort with 3 and nothing would be amiss and that 4 drones doesnt work while youre invisible or boostedmoving and takes time to catch up after a teleport while 3 isnt affected by any of the aforementioned means that most of the time is being spent sucking in things and spitting them back the ice status augment for 3 would be the cherry on top of a cake of smug itzals cosmic crush has over its other skills    sure you could bomb shit with elytron but you cant suck in nearby energy drops and keep doing it like itzal can odonata meanwhile is stuck in the same state preexalted blade excalibur is odonata prime is shiny though ill give it that    the other op piece of shit archwing is amesha aka trinwing but because archwing mobile defence doesnt go that high in enemy levels and archwing defence is still a massive source of ptsd for most players i dont even know if the node still exists it isnt as wellknown    perhaps in the jordas raid the archwings were better represented since segments of it required an archwing but i never bothered to try that before assassination raids were taken down so i cant say anything on that    with the recent ui changes it seems that de is comfortable grouping archwing under the category of auxiliary vehicles in the same bracket as your rocket skateboard so i wouldnt expect any major revisions to the mode to come soon
  rocket skateboard  i had no interest in coming back to this game until that phrase
  fortuna bgm should just be swapped out for a compilation of all the music thats been featured in a tony hawk game once you get that hoverboard    its pretty cool from what ive seen
  jv player your archwing really didnt matter that much since the whole trial was a puzzle so there was no reason not to use iztal    the rocket skateboard is interesting but once you appease the little shits youll likely never use it again
  getting even more spaceships  audio is from tennocon  
umbra is best spacedad    i hope we get cutscenes where umbra comforts a heartbroken tenno after we kill lotus
    its like a minigame that you can play as you go from point a to b during missions and bounties    however in public damn near everyone uses archwings since the launchers were made infiniteuse as of fortuna like how they always should have been the fuckers so using the kdrive will likely mean that youll get left behind from mission point to mission point    also the chances of some cockfaced idiot who would start a container capture bounty while the squad is still 1 klick away from the mission area is extremely high in public which means that being slow means you might not catch up in time to mitigate the fuckfaces stupidity resulting in anything from loss of perfect finish bonus to loss of bounty container capture is the blink and youll lose it mission type of the fortuna update
raven its time for an armored core thread  in case you missed it 
l a p d o g  a  p  d  o  g
whats the next event they could announce ac6 at miyazaki keeps teasing us that there is one i have a feeling it is a viir situation where he didnt plan on making it until someone asked about it at that conference and he made it up on the spot    i want more unique weapons and parts with their own gimmicks instead of the only differences being stats
ive been playing through all the acs i finished the ps1 trilogy last night and im playing 2 i feel like the heat system is pretty annoying in 2 and you get stunlocked much easier
also was thinking of getting fa and vd how bad would the connection be on vd from australia to america/japan
  absolute garbage
  would it even be worth getting them in that case
  theyre both great single player fa never had good online to begin with    get 4 as well its pretty underrated
  historically armored core games just get announced in famitsu one day or something
  arent the servers dead
  not on vd theres people still having matches its part of the reason i want to play them all so i can be prepared for vd but now im having second thoughts if the lag is going to be horrendous
  4 series gameplay is completely different from vs so theres no point in playing it just to prepare yourself like anon say play the 4 series because theyre the best and leave online to vd
im not really feeling 2 whats the general consensus with ac fans about it
this is now a chrome thread murakumo shills can fuck off
chromesois daring to attack progchads
  the game awards
  fuck off chrome we know it was you that released those giant ants
    ac2 is a solid sequel to the ps1 trilogy it added some cool stuff like extensions/inside parts and overboost the game starts off a little slow but stick with it and you are in for a good time to reduce heat problems make sure you get a good radiator quickly and pay attention to the cooling stats on your parts
been reading about gundam breaker 3 is it a good substitute for ac on ps4
  no gb plays more like an action game with mechs
  that just looks like warriors but with mechs instead of people they dont act like mechs thats disappointing
  uh thats just what i said dude its plays like a action game with mechs
  action game with mechs  i wish but this webbum really isnt representative of how gb actually play a boring masher
    gb really isnt a bad substitute if youre only looking for customization    but nothing matches the atmosphere mood and world of an armored core game
  what could you possibly be talking about by the way itd be a shame if an ac were to rampage around your city because you couldnt afford to pay us to run the security around your town
goddamn ac 3 is cool as hell enjoying it a lot more than 2 although this early game machine gun i have feels pretty op
  is this the ost
  people still care about those
  yep some amazing raven ripped all 20 discs
i received ac4 it looks brand new now i hope i can download the updates without updating the ps3s firmware  i still wont launch it before beating all the ac3 games      early  i beat the arenas ace with just the gold machine gun and fast legs its really op especially the gold one honestly i had troubles justifying picking up any other weapons even my tank has it  im close to finish ac3 does the opi stuff carry over to silent line i completely forgot i hope it does because i never liked the back weapons limitations on bipeds i know its supposed to be balanced so you have a reason to get quad/tanks/hovers but come on half of the arenas opponent just blast you with their back wps while boosting all over the place meaning they have the opi and i would have enjoyed the game much more if we were all even and use the same payload even if ultimately the small machine is pretty much everything you need
  20 million
i understand that any amount of human plus is a crutch but man does it feel good not having to worry about radar parts
  the only thing h is good for is unlocking back cannon fire for bipeds without crouching radars are aesthetic as fuck and pretty much all heads have already the very basic functions you need
  yeah but i like having the big detailed radars makes it easier to track targets in missions with lots of enemies im simply not good enough to go without radar the only thing the h welfare radar lacks is a bio sensor but there are good heads with bio sensors so hardly an issue there in ac1 and silent line id run a radar equipped head but none of the ones in ac2 were all that good imo
  for customization sure for actual combat nah but gbs main draw is customization anyways so yknow      this early game machine gun i have feels pretty op  it is theres a reason heat was reworked in nexus and ammo clips were added      does the opi stuff carry over to silent line  it does
  yeah but i like having the big detailed radars  well equip one then as long as you dont need both back slots for weapons if you like that of course  i myself love having a radar backpart theyre super aesthetic and im good enough with blades to not really need a lot of ammo after being forged in the hellfire of lr i even got good at using internals pretty decently
  like i said ac2 was the exception i had a really inefficient heavy build that revolved around the karasawa and the double missile launcher that fires four at once and since i dont like any of ac2s radar heads h was the only way i could get good radar coverage and not sacrifice either a head part i like or my missile launcher in case it wasnt already apparent i basically brute forced my way through ac2    also that is a very nice build
  it does  oh baby thanks better max ac3 then
  h was the only way i could get good radar coverage and not sacrifice either a head part i like or my missile launcher  well you have the right priorities cant really argue with that  playing with a build you dont like is horrible and im a firm believer that playing in a build you like is the best way to play ac  also that is a very nice build  yyou too
  id show off one some of my builds but i dont have a way to screen capture any of my consoles but yeah even if a build is the meta i cant stomach using it if i dont like it
ac3  tring to destroy both part of the massive mt for good opi points  holy shit im getting reckt
  try the dual vertical missile launchers and missile decoys decoys are pretty damn effective cacophanus has a video with that
  thanks ill keep trying
i did it just sniped the fuckers from over 1000 range while laying decoys
  forty million
  congrats all this talk about decoys reminds of that mission where you get payed to play with those poor little mts soldiers firing missiles at you with the commander progressively losing his shit if you dont get hit even once  imagine being an mt pilot that has to spar with a raven
was having a pretty good time playing ac3 on the psp but i kinda hit a roadblock on a mission and the arena so i dropped it thinking about picking it up again
  ac on psp  i remember it being really painful the console just doesnt have enough buttons
  roadblock  being ac a fromsoftwares franchise git gud is a permanent advice that is always valid in absolutely any situation you can beat the game with the starting ac       imagine being an mt pilot  i love how in some missions you mow down mooks dodging dozens of missiles and bullets and others you have to duel against another ac in a duel of piloting and wits   ac scratches my gundam itch so good
  it has enough the problem comes more from their distribution lack of second shoulder buttons means you have to innovate with a franchise whose stock control schemes tend to be rancid garbage at best
  is this emulated that looks a lot better than i remember on ps2
  git gud is a permanent advice that is always valid in absolutely any situation    sounds like shitty game design to me
    you can beat the game with the starting ac  from designs its games in a way that player skill knowledge and tactics are more important than raw numerical stats your equipment only dictates how long it will take to beat your enemies how fast you have to react and how much margin of error you have if you have all the best parts you can still explode due to poor skill  better ravens trump better acs  having no arbitrary mathematical barriers how can you speak of bad design
  sounds like shitty game design to me  i mean ac does have bad game design in some parts but the git gud part isnt one of those  the great thing about this series is that when you get good enough you can overcome your obstacles even with a subpar ac which also allows you to run you own ac build and get so good at using it that you can be an ace pilot with a tin can this is core /m/ stuff nigga if you havent experienced scrapping pilots with high end machines with your beloved garbage bin you havent experienced the peak /m/ condition
  having no arbitrary mathematical barriers  games are highly unbalanced  some parts are clearly better than others  many games rely on giving op shit to enemies ac  the terrible weapon triangle on v/vd    sure skill
  many games rely on giving op shit to enemies ac  only lr does that mostly because without it enemy acs would be total jokes
  games are highly unbalanced  some parts are clearly better than others  im speaking of this when i mention player knowledge and tactics with position and movement you can deny some powerful weapons you can make an op mech with little money if you know what you are buying   and again even with shitty acs is humanly possible to defeat powerful enemies
didnt our friend the cd man also intend to post scans of the booklets did he die
  sounds like youre just shit
  youre just shit dude
im playing ac3 and the tidbits of story and lore i got seem interesting is there any anime with a similar premise or similar themes   i like how everyone is living underground under the control of a single ia and how the corporations are fighting each other i still have to see the rest ive just begun
  the only similar setting i can think of in anime is gurren lagann which is totally unlike ac in most other areas
try for ac4 for a bit  it feels so good to play already much better than v ever felt for me and i wish 3rd gen had quick boost  i fucked up by buying the eu version though its stuck on ver 10 apparently
havent playing ac n quite some time i do missed the online battles with the armored core bros on /vg/ shame they all died
  some of them showed up in the last thread
  i wish 3rd gen had quick boost  technically there are extension parts that give you qb power not nearly as powerful of course but its there      try hitting the cyberpunk genre
  those extension are just for turning faster or boosting backward right  i dont remember any that allowed qb in every directions
  forward backward and turning like i said they arent nearly as powerful as qb frankly theyre useless but theyre the same fundamental dash mechanic from took upped the idea for gen 4
psp anon here i do think my main problem was how small the psp is also the fact that two buttons are dedicated to the camera means you have to jump through some extra hoops my fingers almost always hurt after playing for a few hours
  anon just emulate the ps2 version youll never handle lr on psp i honestly dont see how anyone can the damn thing doesnt even have enough buttons i remember playing sl on it a lot but i could never use left hand wps outside of the shields and occasion blading
which armored core is best  is there a story to follow or can i just build my robutts
  there is a story and you can also build some robutts
  good starting points  armored core 1 from there play the other two ps1 games and then ac2    armored core 3 exists in a standalone universe seperate from the ac1 timeline you may wanna start from nexus since its the first game to introduce dual analogue stick control the story in nexus isnt very complex    armored core 4 is a great game but very distinct from the others it exists in its own universe acv and verdict day exist in the far future of the universe from 4 v isnt very good though
clear every ac3 missions and both arenas  still not 100 complete  damn and i made sure to get every secret parts too
  the fact that two buttons are dedicated to the camera     youll never handle lr on psp    im emulating in psp just fine change the default controls find the configuration that suits you iirc the psp has l and r as triggers asigned to the cammera change that sugestion  use l to normal boost and r to shoot the arrows for movement  for camera that way you have a hand for moving and a hand for looking and shooting use the stick for the rest of the buttons switch weapon overboost extra orbit mele etc it will also depend on your mech and what parts of it you want to have more accesible  you can make a completely different setup if you use l r for strafing     also git gud
   x and sq
  thanks but im fine with the ps2 versions
  ive cleared final form zinaida on psp    the secret to last raven is that you will lose missions solely on the basis of what you built in the garage before youre even thrown into the mission
lads how do i kill crow on destroy ac sight hawk  hes too fast to hit and my targeting ends up focusing on the suicide weapons
the hatemails in sls arena
  lads how do i kill crow on destroy ac sight hawk  which crow  usw bombing crow or geofront crow
  usw bombing crow
  tough shit crow will be mostly playing around in mid air and as youve noticed hes pretty good at dribbling and bunny hopping so its hard to get a good lock on him and the constant usw bombing doesnt help  one way to tackle him is to load on micromissiles and get a good fcs with short lock on time but youll need to mind your distance since micromissiles tend to be very easily dodged if youre too close to your target youll need some practice if youre not used to those  another way to do him in would be to just try and stay close to him as long as you can and use a machinegun but its not really what i would suggest since getting a consistent lock on him is not easy at all during that mission and again the constant usw rain is extremely hard to deal with in such an environment  vertical missiles are also a possible choice but crow tends to be a pretty fast dodger given his build hes not a fatass like jack or rimfire so verticals will probably miss a lot id really suggest you to stick to micros if you want to use missiles  another possible tactic is to get a quad and a moonlight and try to blade him in his downtimes when hes on recovery frames after he bunnyhops but i reckon it would be extremely hard in that particular scenario chances are you can oneshot him if you do get a hit in though
      oh i get it  orca dawg  imma gunna make ya bleed
  feelin the cold  yah wont be for much longah      thanks anon ill try spamming micro missiles while dodging with a light build
does anyone else prefer the original white glint over the fa version joshua was a cool character i wish he could have had more screen time
  those knee joints  no  im sorry but legs are a big deal to me and those things are definitely not okay
  sqircle
  in case you missed it   missed what im not wasting my time downloading dolphin porn
  its an anons rip of the 20th anniversary box set
    i remember that one thought we now have full flac rip here     there are 9 seeders atm including me so grab them fast
      its not like you need missiles though i just beat him with dual linear rifles this mission is also quite forgiving when it comes to getting s rank since i finished with barely over 3k ap and still got it git fast  
  i thought he was pretty easy tbh crow has very low defenses try to stun lock him with linear rifles or bazookas
  you hardly need anything in lr other than piloting skills but some builds do make your life a lot easier than others  the actual danger in that mission comes from the usw so its best to have something that can do the job quickly and with the lower skill requirements as possible the other version of crow is a joke but thats because its a radically different scenario where you dont need to be constantly on the move and mind everything around you not to mention the lock on problems
my favorite feature from v is the boost kick i want them to keep that and add punches as well for when youre completely out of ammo or just drop your weapons
give me an acv pc port please
  would there be a solid community on pc i know at least 3 people who would be down plus myself finally give me a reason to get a good headset    from has released most of their games on steam lately so unless sony bankrolls ac6 it will probably follow
  im 99 sure if armored core came out on pc the souls fanbase would flock to it as the new from software game and at least some of them would actually stick around past the initial surge
  how would you guys feel about the ac6 box featuring a big from the makers of dark souls sticker
  as long as its a sticker i can remove and not part of the box art    i want a really nice box this time
    please god    however acv and vd came out after dark souls became the hottest thing around and they got way less attention from gamers than ac4a so i guess theres more to it than just slapping their name on it
  the souls fanbase would flock to it as the new from software game  i dont want them  the souls fanbase actively ruined the games with their bullshit about pvp muh honoraburu duels muh hardcore gayming creed and whatever else id rather ac to stay niche and die than having to go through that shit ill never not be mad about having my favorite weapons and builds be nerfed into uselessness because of those thin skinned faggots  those cancerous little shits would bitch and moan about anything and turn everything into shitposting about which game is the best game why the latest entry is shit etc look at how theyre treating ds3    actually now that i think about it the way the ds series mirrors gen 3 ac games in terms of design evolution is almost scary
  acv and vd were tough to get into even for ac vets i know     was ac4a so huge because it was so easy in comparison or was it the more gundamstyled designs the zippy flying combat
  look at how theyre treating ds3  to be fair ds3 was lazy game made with bloodborn leftovers
  theres nothing lazy about ds3 and by the same reasoning ac should be even worse especially gen 3 when they recycled games after games for five entries  its a good game and gets a lot of nonsensical shitposting and gratuitous hate and you know it
  yeah but it wasnt on pc pc is where dark souls kinda exploded
  i really like the expansions and i hope they get back to doing 2 or 3 per generation instead of just the one

  wait the ps2 version looks like that why the fuck did i gimp myself with portable
  make game that does not require any powerups or anything to beat  bad design
  were right here       ac4 doesnt even look like gundam ffs it looks like something nagano made half of the time
  the western mecha vidya community has historically been pccentric mechwarrior is as old as fromsoftware itself and its fanbase is still very much alive im sure theyd come around if from gave em a chance this fact was apparently used that as a basis for giving us chromehounds twelve years ago as a launch title on the xbox 360  despite it being so underwhelming  from has released most of their games on steam lately so unless sony bankrolls ac6 it will probably follow  this is more likely than a remaster because having to deal with international licensing issues of past games in the franchise probably isnt something they wanna confront yet pic related but then again were getting a largely untouched version of metal wolf chaos next year so maybe theyll consider doing the same for armored core somehow    people forget that dark souls only ever really exploded in popularity after fans petitioned from to give em a shitty console port for the pc    sure but the zippyflying combat still gets 4thgen referred to as gundam simulators to this day all of fromsofts games are known for their high barrier of entry and armored core is no different
  v sold really well in japan    westerners dont play armored core competitively they just want their hero fantasy so always online and team focused balance is just shitting in their kids cereal
i cant believe there are literally 0 westerners who want to play competitive ac and every japanese person is a god and a nineball at it truly astounding
  i did it anon  the micro missiles werent really working out so i grabbed a bazooka and took some close range shots against him  after about 9 he goes down pretty quick     that final boss was really underwhelming though
  the psp versions were the versions i first played theyre fine and to be fair i have a bit of reshade magic going on here and pcsx2 still has a few rare bugs
  i cant believe you felt the need to expose what a fucking autistic idiot you are    by the way ive played both versions of vd and in fact the average japanese player is about 10x better than the western versions average players and their absolute fucking trash can builds
  but how could you compare competitive jp to competitive west if no one in the west plays comp ac
  i cant believe you felt the need to expose what a fucking autistic idiot you are
  multiplayer shit ruin the game it ruined v and for what nothing there was no one playing v online
  my mistake anyone who opposes you is an idiot you must be a right winger
  m8 you kinda proved him right here
  but there are still 7 hour streams of vd multiplayer being done in japan like once a week
  fuck japan im glad ac6 wont pander to them
  its a good game and gets a lot of nonsensical shitposting and gratuitous hate and you know it  that would be ds2
  when  is it the switch from game
  t friendless incel who never got to enjoy the best part of v/vd
  more like t region locked europoor  normalfag retard
  ah yes playing online trash all day with other fellow fat nerds truly the sign of a successful fellow
wait so hes complaining about both people playing online and not playing jesus fuck is he mentally ill
  this desu  acv just couldnt work on eu servers still there was a few nice people but even an absolute shitter like me had no issues against most of them in a light ac
  thats great dude  that final boss was really underwhelming though  lr has four different final bosses i take you fought evangel in that case hes the most underwhelming one
  lr has four different final bosses  5 final bosses    evangel  biped pulv  hover pulv  jacko  zinaida
  jacko  uh i guess he counts as well i was just taking into account the pulverizers and zinaida since you still need to destroy the internecine after fighting jack or evangel
  roßweiße
we want you to deeeestroy die zeomatrixxx outpost      was he autistic
damn  
who else is in the loves every gen of ac camp
  absolutely based im almost in that camp i dont really enjoy 2 and i assume i wont enjoy another age i liked gen 1 and ac 3 is great so far
  theyre all great games
  i didnt like vs direction and tech issues but i still played it a ton and loved everything it did right
nineball did nothing wrong
can someone explain the ending of ac 1 to me what was the deal with that computer
  the computer was nineball who tried to kill the player for upsetting the balance of the corporations because they were too fucking good the mission to destroy the mines was another trap but as usual the player is a walking god of destruction  moa seems to ignore that ac1 even happened but its still listed in the official timeline so im not really sure how that works
  so its been a long time but from memory 9ball is the ai that also runs ravens nest and creates the first missions at the start of the game you pick one of these which then triggers the shit fight between the two corporations  some say this is also why the character art looks like arnold from the terminator because 9ball is basically skynet
  the computer in ac1 was a decoy  nineball waited until the raven died of old age then came back in moa assuming there wouldnt be any more outlying dominants
  can we please get proper scans of this book
  no no  ds2 deserves all the hate it gets
how do i git gud with hover builds i cant dodge shit while using a hover leg
is ninebreaker worth playing
  not him but yes it is
  hhes fast
  i think 4 as a series is more liked just because the movement feels incredibly responsive/is unique and v is more methodical and slow in comparison which has been the standard since the ps1/2 era i almost wish they were released in the opposite order
  i hope the music goes back to the 4 style i thoughts 5th gen music was pretty subpar
  totes gen 4 is my personal favorite because of the sheer scale of it all but i think early gen 3 had the best overall gameplay out of all the games while late gen 3 had some of the best ac designs oracle fascinator cascade range dual face etc im not too fond of gen 5 mostly with gameplay mechanics and mission structure but i enjoyed what was there
  no is basically a glorified and extended tutorial and your reward for all that a nineball fight
  id honestly argue 5th gens style isnt all that different structurewise the instrumentation is different to reflect each eras theme but its still very much a kota hoshino / frequency sound between the two generations
    i want some chu ishikawa styled music kings field most likely had contribution from him for the music but his industrial sounds would fit an ac title really well
does /acg/ live once more
  animal crossing general never died as far as i can recall
whats the deal with armored core mobile does it have a story where does it fit in the armored core lore
  5th gen can be pretty fast and technical if youre being slow and methodical that means youre using a build that suits that style
  if youre being slow and methodical that means youre using a build that suits that style  alternatively it could mean that the player in question doesnt know how to actually fight ive found that a lot of the guys who complain about vvds speed dont have an adequate grasp of 5th gens systems honestly    ac games are usually good at showing the difference between noobs and actually skilled players but 5th gen is where that difference becomes pretty damn noticeable 
  i stated in comparison to 4 i get that light rush builds with piledrivers required technical skill speed and positioning but 5 will never be in the same league as 4 for how fast people move period  with that being said v has more depth to me and thats an entirely different discussion
  the fuck how does that exist
  i might just get acvd in nip because that computer sounds super cute
playing nexus for a bit its so much better with dual sticks holy shit yet its still harder than 3 because the fcs window is much smaller its also annoying that the aiming isnt analog but you can make your ac walk slowly though
  i cant decide whether i like 4s invisible fcs window or vs more standard tps reticle better
  there was some good stuff though                  
  those are alright but really more like background noise and are not prominent in the game or evoke any kind of tension or mood like 4 did            
i want more spooky tracks in ac  
  the menu music to 3 is so melancholic
im asking again but did ac4/fa had any real patches that improved the games or is it just stat nerfs  i didnt hack my ps3 and i doubt i ever will but id still rather not install the latest fws
  i think you probably just had the bgm setting too low chief
started really playing ac4 for the first time i kind of expected bigger missions than this coming from a lot of v  still great though the hard default mech needed very few tuning to feel great right from chapter 2  that said after all the memes about ac4 being 2fast5you i excepted something way faster this is pretty much a less clunky v although the qbs feels fucking amazing its not so fast right now
in 2013 kota released this sunrise his most accomplished album i think his undisputed masterpiece is day after day a song so catchy most people probably dont listen to the lyrics but they should because its not just about the trials of being a mercenary and the importance of corporations its also a personal statement about the armored core franchise itself hey paul
  with some aaliyah boosters and a light frame youll get some of that speed but most people who talk about the fourth gen speed are thinking of fa
  interesting ill try getting lighter
  day after day coyld easily be used for a anime opening
make sure you fill out thag soundtrack questionaire and tell fromsoft to make a new game
  atmospheric music in ac is great      
  ac4 is actually about as fast as last raven but on a bigger scale and with more permaflight options ac for answer is when it goes absolutely balls to the wall cuhrazy like pic related
  forgetting best girl stiletto
  fa has a regulation patch that gives everyone infinite energy whether you think that improves the game is ymmv but ive found that some missions get better some get worse next fights at least get somewhat more interesting since the base game has them too easy for the most part
  i like 115 just because i already s ranked everything and it lets me build for maximum aesthetics without losing much efficiency since everything is op
  i use it when a battle looks like it could benefit from more highflying high speed action the line ark battles in particular are so much better with unlimited energy because in any other regulation the ai just go underneath the bridge which is an absolute waste of the stages aesthetics doesnt help that both fragile and stasis are normally way too slow to justify their piss poor defenses    its also good with the answerer and the antisatellite battery missions
  i think you forgot one    
  reeeeeeeeeeee
overall which generation do you prefer to play
  3
should i just go straight to the nexus series ive been playing through 3 and im up to about 30 completion but i really want to see whats considered the peak of the series and thats the nexus series
  just keep playing because the peak is pretty subjective and a lot of people also consider silent line to be the top
  why would you skip part of the story
    turns out the game just gets shit at that transport alloy mission for me not sure why but it frustrated me to no end even though it was really easy i got past it though im probably just tilted from something
  but i really want to see whats considered the peak of the series and thats the nexus series  no thatd be 3sl you could make a case for last raven being a peak for pvp but as a whole early gen 3 has always been seen as the golden age both in terms of gameplay and peak player popularity      because   after ten titles formula front included agetec feels that its super indepth mech simulator  the gran turismo of mech combat as its being called  is a bit too exclusive for the average gamer  thats a problem companies need more people playing their products to keep the franchises going but they also cant just throw the basic principles of the series out the window and so agetec has come up with nine breaker a game that is every bit about the customization and control of advanced mechanized war machines as nexus was before it but this ones plan is to educate not dominate  nine breaker doesnt have any actual missions agetec believes that nexus rather quick engagements that were both followed and preceded by lengthy introductions were too much for casual players to handle with that in mind the developers at from software have this time reworked the basic concept of armored core now there is virtually no setup or aftermath you just pick an exercise and go  according to company representatives agetec is positioning nine breaker as the ultimate armored core introductory package that will hopefully get fans and new folk alike ready to handle forthcoming onlinecentric and playstation3 games    if it sounds dumb its because it is 
  i think thats a good idea did it work
  it did not the fact that its one of the least popular ac games should tell you all you need to know    and it didnt even end up help players with the forthcoming onlinecentric and playstation3 games since those played completely differently anyways
  meant for 
  v is in fact really fucking fast if you dont eat paint    that said 4 is a game where you can permafly and its not that hard but still only possible for energy efficient builds fa is a game thats level design flat out assumes you permafly this is only like 99 true though rip tank shitters its like if you had permanent scan mode in vd compared to 4
    thanks guys thankfully i found a way to get updates without updating the ps3  infinite en sounds amazing
  4 and 1
  fucking kek this makes no sense the hell is wrong with these companies dont you need nexus to even get parts to use in ninebreaker anyway  making the revolution disc of nexus its own game with premade super acs would have been a lot better to get new players
  3  silent line and last raven are the peak of the franchise
why can i only select another raven to help me out sometimes in 3 it doesnt seem to be every mission is there something im missing
4  need to shot down some super durable cannons  tfw you can just shoot or blade the platforms theyre fixed on instead  tfw huge and varied enemy number is making some weapon types actually useful  tfw hard mode is actually good due to this  fucking amazing this game is 10/10 finally i feel like a robot doing robot things instead of destroying boxes or being some sort of spy agent evading security lasers in a repetitive hangar
  im not even finished yet  tfw the game actually give a shit about weight balance  lasers have ammo costs as they always should have did v had that i forgot  you cant just rush to your objective if you want good payout  swords feels nice as fuck too bad theres no pile drivers though
  some missions force you to pick a particular consort to deploy with you nothing you can do about it      lasers have had ammo costs in every single ac game the only exception is laser blades also there are pile drivers in 4 theyre categorized as just blade i think they have a janky punch animation and are nowhere as cool as you would think they are but they do gorillions of damage if you actually manage to land a hit v/vd has the best pile drivers in the series though theyre fucking huge and have cartridges that cycle the stakes through and everything and the punching animation looks a lot better than any other games piles    i miss the piles in chromehounds 
  lasers have had ammo costs  unless im thinking of something else no they havent theyve always been infinite use and didnt subtract from your ammo at the end of a mission
  lasers have had ammo costs in every single ac game  what bizzaro ac game did i play then i always specifically choose energy wps in early games to save on ammo cost
in last raven they have no cost but limited ammunition
  lasers have had ammo costs in every single ac game  no they dont the whole point of laser weaponry is that it doesnt have ammo costs
      i know it doesnt cost money i thought we were talking about how lasers have ammunition like every other weapon and can run out eventually
  damn i need to watch big o
i hated fighting this dude
tfw cant make a cool emblem
  4 era hard mode is one my favorites shit in videogames ever the fact that you get some extra lore and plot tibits that flesh what you knew already after playing normal while also making some missions more fun is fucking amazing in my opinion
  have ammunition like every other weapon and can run out eventually    i suppose the guns have something a battery or some energy transmisor that fries or have limit on how much can be used without some form os resupplie or part changing allowing energy guns to have a limit on ammo       spoiler  never got to play chromehounds  everyone that did praise that game to no end    i feel i missed something fantastic and it will never comeback
  shade was fucking cool especially since you never quite understand whether he was the same guy throughout gen 3 or just different people who picked up the name and emblem
attacking a next pilot while hes out of it  super scum
  every ac has ammo counts for energy weapons
two nexts fighting above a desert wasteland  suddenly bright flash  hi nu gundam and nightingale fall out of tear in space time continuum
what direction would you like to see ac designs take next
  something similar to nexus and lr
  youre wrong      absolutely
  nexts but at 5gens sizes
  i like how even at a glance this is identifiably a kawamori design
reminder
  has someone bought and scanned that book yet
  return to gen 3 because it was the best    im also a big fan of 5s style but not necessarily some of the other design decisions that went along with it
  gen 3 is honestly very fucking overrated very few missions are actually good
  you can tell the 4 babbys because theyre the only ones who bother shitting on other generations rather than posting about what they like
  i like good mission design you too brainlet to understand what that really and just assume bullshit on top of that  ac1 has some better missions than ac3  v is undoubtedly the best btw
  post in response to mechanical design  retard talks about mission structure
  t 3 babby memester
  respond to a post about mecha design  hurr 3 is the best because said it is  blame him for that
  projecting much the question was what design direction do you want  was clearly a straightforward reply that they liked 3s and some of 5s designs best the only person acting shitty is you
  youre wrong  shut it you triple jian  dont talk to me until you get lvl 11 legs
gonna finish acsl soon it was much better than ac3 hopefully nexus shows the same improvements
does the ac from moa intro have a name
  in moa no in last raven theres an ai arena opponent with a replica of that design named rabbit foot     
  does psychoframe activate or do the nexts stomp
  this i love 1st 2nd and 35 gen but i dont get why everyone wanks over 3 i havent played silent line but the missions in ac3 arent even good usually theyre insanely cramped
  not to be that powerlevel guy but given how everyone in acer including valks can hardly keep up with a slightly customized nineball seraph i have my doubt the hinu and nightingale can do much against a fucking next let alone two of them
  slightly customized nineball  its a bit more than slightly customized when it has orbit cannons optical camouflage and primal armor
  not liking the ship cargo mission   or the bomb defusal mission   or the tons of other good ones  yeah there are shit missions but way less compared to 1 or 2
  sl and obviously nexuslr are much better and the balance is better so even shooting down mts in corridors gets fun  although desu those games still have their fair share of problems
  axis shock aftermath the two nexts stop fighting to see what the fuck just happened agree to brief ceasefire and take char and amuro back to their respective home bases  then suddenly celestial being s2
i wish there was more emphasis on running with the bipedal legs rather than just boosting around constantly i liked how the first gen had a pretty fast run speed
  gosh the ac below flipflop is so annoying
  you could replicate that in later entries but it wasnt fast enough to actually dodge bullets by just running like i remember doing in at least ac1
  that image it makes no sense   all those games were published over a decade ago its like the guy decided to act like an expert on ip law because he read one line  its true those companies had publishing rights but the publishing rights for entertainment software aka vidya gaymz isnt a lifetime contract standard practice is 10 years and considering the niche nature of those games i doubt any of those publishers would have pushed for a longer term  tldr theres no need to buy out publishing rights just wait them out at this time probably all the publishing rights except for v and vd are expired ip rights are owned until sold or traded publishing rights expire just like trademarks
  theres also an out clause in these contracts as a standard usually in the form of if such and such hasnt published said game in this amount of time publishing rights are forfeit which would still end up defaulting most of the games on the list
  collection when
  i hate that my super heavy biped is garbage in verdict day because all the heavy parts are te so some asshole with a battle rifle pushes my shit in every time
  vs rps shit is such a mistake  you can still do something balanced at least but yeah it does limit the parts you want to use for no good reason
  coordinate with your team ya dingus
  not being a lone raven
  could never get into v/vd because of that rock papers scisors shit it just made every encounter feel so antifun
  i need an edit of that comic of the guy sticking a stick into his bike because thats what playing 5th gen solo is
  right and its funny how youre forced to do it anyway because no one plays 5th gen especially v which was doa
  it probably plays better in japan what with the better net infrastructure and shorter physical distances between players
  yeah definitely and im jelly but i wouldnt have been this mad over v if only it wasnt region locked its a shame because the netcode was very good otherwise and the few matches i had were a blast
anyone got tips for investigate magna ruins
  that doesnt make an all te unit not shit and i hate the optimal builds because they look like shit
  what do you mean its your standard vs ac fight and one of them easily get stuck if somehow you cant do try to friendlykill the bitch with highly powered stuff before she start attacking you
  thats with huntress as a consort right bring the mt consort as well to distract one of them use a 20 ammo spare mag the 1000 ammo mg the missile decoy inside parts and a good blade to deal with the mts without wasting precious ackilling mg ammo their ai is retarded so its easy enough to trap one in a corner or other spot and melt or blade them to death then dont get greedy killing the other one on all my successful attempts huntress has died first
  ke core ce arms are optimal builds and they look pretty okay
  i enjoy 5th gen simply because its the only generation ive played
  well i hope youll enjoy 6th gen even more
is chromehounds still playable in single player or did the whole thing get fucked when live shut down
  chromehounds sp is extremely short
  the game functions in singleplayer but theres almost no point unless you just want to depress yourself by experiencing a glimpse of the games potential by playing the campaign in ac terms the campaign is basically just you going on a killing spree against mts theres six campaigns each tailored to the different mech roles you can play so you do get a lot of variety in exactly how youre supposed to stomp all the mts to death it can be kind of fun if youre just desperate to play another mech game i guess    rip in peace chromehounds
  ac6 is false it will never happen
  
  that shit is old we havent even got a site or something
  these things they take time
this thread made me want to give v/vd a try so i bought 5 off ebay already had vd from a few years ago also picked up 4 because fuck it gonna head to the mall in a few days to see if they have any older ones
  vs servers are dead m8 id just start with vd
  eh it doesnt take long to run through vs single player may as well play it since he bought it
  in development not in production youre not gonna get a site and shit while theyre working on coding and modeling theyre not eactivision to try and sell you shit still under the knife at best youll get a page and a trailer tacked onto their ac hub site six months before release
  especially when v has such a good singleplayer
mook incoming get hype
  spoilers for gurenlancelot
  yasuda sketches yes
  redorga here the model number ends in sc instead of the old ac
  is it out or are these just previews      these actually look pretty cool      thats a weird retcon
    new chapter for pointless gaiden how exciting
book summary
someone uploaded the book onto chinese msl im currently downloading
    i believe its /ourgirl/ china btw
  nice    you gonna make a new batch to dl or is there a link
    its a baidu download so ill have to make a new download link i suppose
oh it got a digital release
    yeah its what was uploaded to the chinese site
  looking forward to it the new vincent models have really caught my interest on what is in here    it also explains why benio hasnt gotten a custom kmf yet since the sutherland customs were only temporary to begin with
    slightly better res
    these were also a surprise
  upload the zip to meganz
  holy shit its that thing from fragments and maybe that might be benios
  actually these are the kmf from the pachinko slightly modified
  the brighton was definitely mentioned in the 3rd story of fragments man of zero weird knowing its the pachinko kmf though i never expected wed ever get those    this databook is amazing
nothing works on panbaidu links for me its up to scanbro to upload it to meganz for us
    im doing that as we speak
  colored palomides or even specs for it
    no colored no its onlya footnote really    
  thanks a lot
  did you use the official baidu client to download or another method i have loads of things to download from there
  nice cant wait to look through this treasure trove
    the official client i downloaded this waayyyy back before they started being more forceful about who and who cant use their clients     also balofo the alexanders have model numbers this time as do the britannan akito stuff
  of course they have this is the purpose of this book    also finally lineart for needle blazer
    indeed i could have sworn the needle blazer was in a previous book probably wrong whoever did those lg vincents isnt the original artist obviously
    even the drone has a model number
  lg kmf is by astrays
burais model number bs solved  type1r for vanilla  type10r for zeros  type1rc for the kai    all with unique h/w as it should be    never lineart for the missile launcher
this databook covers literally every single kmf ever used in anything barring onepanel variations     really cool stuff
hey balofo does this thing resolve the gmg confusion with kmf generations i see it labels bradford as a 6th gen but doesnt have any examples of 8th generation in that box and all rounds stuff are under 7th generation
  gmg and this arent official sources but this one is way more consistent since it does list the nonbritannian kmf as gen equivalent as it should be    so i abide by the r2 booklets that list the kor kmf as 8th gen
gracchus was rpi210 makes sense    also this has more cg models for weapons than the product works
    these look neat
nice back colored lineart for the ds twin units
nice book but  doesnt explain tech like mordreds all range bomber  no development chart  gen stuff is still inconsistent   not enough lineart wasting space on screencaps from anime  no specs for some kmf and nonkmf stuff    basically we got akito specs and thats it
    im glad im getting my own copy ill probably end up trying to snag myself some bigger scans of stuff
  the ultimate book for lineart will always be that limited expensive one
    i wish i could get it 
  which one was that
  code geass deluxe archives movic mook that needed to be preordered    nowadays only in auctions
  you think someone could translate the info of those two frames
   oh thanks
  brighton developed after the vincent went mp its a high level machine designed to command wards story from the shitty novel regarding the test pilot 30 units were later rolled out and saw combat    meigethsu developed to counter the britannian high fire power kmf em motors added to flight unit to enhance output and reinforce radiation radiation barriers built in the shoulders mean this machine was developed on a hitrun concept a dozen or so were rolled out and saw battle against emperor lelouch    pretty cool a shame we will never get a girhens greed inspired geass game
  interesting     even if we dont maybe someone will make a fan game one day i can only imagine there have been a couple of those already somewhere online
    balofo if you see any of the dx archives up somewhere let me know
  geass deserves both a gundam vs game and a ghirens greed game    will never happen though
  basically keep searching for コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュ 豪華設定資料集 on yahoo auction jp/otomart/mandarake    original price was 7500 yen so you know they arent ripping you off with a used book
  this looks pretty cool
  sweet another vincent model
  after looking at my files these are 11 the pachinko units just colored differently    brightons rifle combines the 3 parts to form a long rifle  meigethsu shouder blades can be handheld for melee
hey balofo if possible could you translate the bios for the vincent snipe and blaze
  snipe uses the same hadron blaster from the gram head has high precision sensor and it has msv lance type for melee not in the text but it retains the hakens and needle blazers in addition to 1 shoulder landspinner    blaze the shoulder have removable bl generators that act as knuckles when equipped on the handsdoesnt have the shoulder factspheres only the head ones like old kmfs not in the text but it retains the needle blazers and the mvs also its hakens are a different design
  neat any new details in the data like for stuff like the valiants and drones or the video game stuff
  also forgot to ask but what does meigetsus name mean i know its moon related
  nope valiants shouldnt have the same weight as the type02s since the valiants have smaller landspinnersunless magic coincidence    unmanned drones have different model numbers from the manned ones
  it should be meigetsu indeed it means crying moon
  yeah i noticed that ill be splitting the unmanned drones with the manned ones      thank you its hard to input kanji from images since i cant copy/paste  i just figured its in the same boat as the red ogre and got unlucky that it was added in by some nip who cant into english    also did we ever get nontoaster quality pics of the brighton and meigetsu from the pachinko game
  you be like a dog with 2 tails filling the wiki with this new specs over the weekend    pachinko stuff is hard to come by the brighton was white with red details and the meigetsu was light brown with mahogany details
  ive already started on the meigetsu but this stuff has put me in a good mood blows the previous book from september out of the water    yeah sucks too i always tried to find florence footage for images wish i could find those and new pics of these ones but like you say footage is hard to come by
  did the mosaic novel name any of the brightons weapons
  dont remember but do remember it saying its weapon was a railgun
  the h/w specs for the zikisan/zangetsu are correct in this book btw    did mosaic end if not meigetsu could appear in it
  one more story two chapters for december    i liked the november story about a detective and a pluton member tracking down a killer using geass but thats less for being code geass and more just enjoying that genre of story    i wont say fragments is bad but it is largely disappointing to me next to no kmf so far with the third story being the only one to have them and the biggest sin of it to me complete and total lack of any images even pics of characters the stories arent terrible but at the same time theyre nothing special
  also does the meigetsu bio say anything about its shoulder swords or will i have to wing it on those
  nothing just handheld blades as per pachinko
  what does the brighton label those big engine looking things on its wings
  also could you repost the pachinko stuff of the brighton and meigetsu the pics/webm
can somebody translate this please
  and one other thing too which drone model number is which i have a feeling but always best to get clarifications for accuracy
     welp
    neato
    my prayers are answered
  blue shoulder   im in love
reference to akito
    
  the drill is not there    so i guess the guren gets a new upgrade during the movie
fuck this shitty cgi    why
  it hurt extra bad because i hadnt seen any up until a minute into this the cg lack of lulu and abundance of kallen was depressing
movie final battles is gonna be ps3 cgi shitfest    hype killed
re trailer with official eng subs    
    so then where is the a they just showed off its mrd last month no way they didnt already know about these new designs and they wouldnt make a figure of a scrapped design this late    more evidence that the a will be lelouchs
strangely the cgi doesnt bother me much i just want more geass and they just delivered on giving me a new lancelot though its shame its lineart wont follow its predecessors
  i dont care about quality i just want something with geass in the title and ill be happy  youre the absolute worst kind of shit eater sadly youre the kind thats easy money for these studios so youll get what you want
  im really digging this design i like the focus on adding a dragon motif to play off of lancelots knight motif
    implying im paying to see the movie
  i think they will have both 2d and 3d so let us not say that
  you folks realize even gundam has some cgi scenes these daysplus lelouch will likely show up later no problem with kallen
  you folks realize even gundam has some cgi scenes these days  the build series and ibo never had the main units that were front and center in cg    lelouch will likely show up later  he definitely will the problem is that hes the lifeblood of the series and needs to be in it for more than just the final act    no problem with kallen  shes a dumb bitch who doesnt deserve a large share of screen time
  asymmetrical mecha  muh dick
  shes a dumb bitch who doesnt deserve a large share of screen time  kallen deserves the most screen time
  adding a dragon motif  yeah i remember the gurren in r2 looked kinda like a bird
  theres two options    a lelouch will not show up at all until literally a cliffhanger ending    b lelouch will appear but only after like 40 or 50 minutes presumably thats close to half the movie basically
  i am getting used to seeing both 2d and 3d mecha in other shows so this is not a big issue for me
    exactly i dont see the problem to be honest
this cgi is horrendous inhouse sunrise is guaranteed garbage
  ive seen worse either way only certain scenes will have that
  wow lancelot albion looks better than ever and the varis looks cool
  lancelot gram
  it looks like they use cgi in this part
  new shinkiro new lancelot albion new guren seiten and a new white kmf awesome
  metal robot damashii
    in the earlier previews though the kmf werent all cgi i remember scenes of the old guren going through a forest which was the regular code geass kmfstyle as opposed to the cgi
  even now they arent all cgi it might be they simply want this night sequence to be in cg for whatever reason
  or sunrise is splitting resources with all those gundams so a few fights will be 2d but not all of them
    wonder if this is still appearing
will there be mp shen hu
  what if lelouch only reapppears as suzaku backed up part of his consciousness in suzaku with geass
    doesnt look like it zeros kmf seems to just be shinkiro with mvss
do i have to watch the recap movies before the new movie i heard they retconned some stuff like shirleys death
  nope movies are a badly edited mess
  nah lelouch will appear as zero to save the day in the last act with the final shot showing lelouch with his code
  not necessary    since the movies are just the tv with new scenes and the mao arc never happened    here you cna watch the new scenes      
  posted the wrong link for part 3   
my wife
  i dont think this is all of it  im very sure the scene where lelouch and suzaku neutralize the fleja was redrawn as well
  not necessary but theyre very watchable if you havent seen the show in a long time and want to refresh your memory
so zilikistanor whatever kingdom had defeated britannia in the past love retcons    nunally and suzaku are captured in the beginning then karen lloyd and saki go to zilikistan and also get captured set 2 years after zero requiem
even the cockpits are cgi hype dying fast
  cgi is all the range nowadays
  cgi mecha not done by orange is always trash
  orange cg robots are the same trash as the rest spinning the camera really fast wont change that
  orange cg mecha is bad    opinion discarded    back to /a/ loser
  bbut mjp  youre blind and retarded your opinions are worthless
  orange  not trash    orangutangs not even once
  orange  only did mjp    lmao     have you taken a shower today kid
  mjp  not the go to example retards use when they want to pretend orange is good  mjp was shit as was akito comet lucifer and everything in between kill yourself worthless tripfag
  that school bullying traumatized you pretty hard kid
  i think itll probably be used for lelouch towards the second half or last quarter of the movie
  its not strictly needed so far but if you want to remember stuff and dont have the time to watch the tv series again go for it movie 2 does have some rushed parts but you also skip a lot of pointless r2 material
  britannia didnt conquer every part of the world and since these people have at least one person with geass plus some other technology its not impossible to believe theyd hold back a britannian force and remain isolated somewhere in central asia/the middle east
  there were cgi trains and ships back in the original show too i dont know why you would get so mad at a cockpit being in 3d
  orange is the best by far but i think youre too stingy by acting like everyone else is bad
  well i dont see why they would make and show off a figure of it a month ago if it wasnt
  faction pulled out of their ass they did write themselves into a corner with the r2 ending was expected      yeah trains and ships not kmf or even fucking cockpits akito didnt go this retarded way      inhouse sunrise is complete trash look at origin
  orange is just good cgi as envisioned by people who hate cgi to begin with so calling them the best doesnt really mean jack shit
  just like how gundam comes up with neoneozeon factions all the time its inevitable yes      i think suzakus cockpit as zero is still 2d so theyre not changing all of them to 3d       i admit origins 3d wasnt very great but i thought it was tolerable       i guess it always depends on the viewers attitude towards 3d in the end
  i hope this guy dies a painful death
  it will only be painful if its above the belt hes a cripple
  it appears he gets to become a pilot and is connected to the robot as well as to some other system     so i can imagine hell feel something if the robot or that system get damaged
they just showed off a again and alongside the new lancelot and guren    its definitely still showing up and is almost certainly going to lelouch at this rate
  perhaps it will be zero even if that somehow isnt actually lelouch nor suzaku
  another option would be that one of the bad guys pretends to be zero for a while so itll be suzaku and kallen teaming up against that mecha
  the trailer seems to be hinting otherwise but i believe the centurion/gladiatorlooking kmf is likely to not be enough to handle an albion or seiten class on its own
  this time they showed the a having the varis type weapon in hand
you know if they plan to release another trailer just before the movie like in january i wonder if the background music this time for the ending theme by union  revive to hear what to expect to those to watch the ending credit scenes
  well with the part they look like in cg the kmf does seem to faced them
  indeed but we dont know if theyre all the kmfs on the field/sky they might be hiding the one shown above
  i think itll at least be used in commercials closer to the release a good chance of that exists right now

  do you have a link of where you found this
  thats another lancelot and guren to add to the collection
  on /toy/ in the rd general
  jibun woooooo
this had better not fucking be the final render/lighting this is a monster franchise and even xebec does a better job that this they actually managed to make the fuckyou hand look uncool
  they have nakada a budget and time and yet they decide to use shitty cgi
  were twothree months away so probably it will look slightly different
  unicorn had all those things quite literally and even there they had both 2d and 3d which is what they are doing here apparently
  kmfs arent as complex to animate as the rx0 and its transformation    fucking bs
  probably just the angle but this looks really bulky not a fan of the red claws either
over here it seems that new variant is called lancelot albion zero      also could someone translate the description from the picture the part under its identification code as z01z0
  as well as the other descriptions for this shot
  lancelot albion zero ver ka next
    so there is like no doubt at all left that this is lelouchs new knightmare right
  brighton  r  i  g  h  t  o  n
  nope theres a short story for it      its zeros as in suzakus   short story also has oz references with oldrin and neha appearing in it
  you think they only used cg because of the transformations it could have been about the original rx78 and they would have made it cg anyway its the times not the show the cg could even fly if the shading pass afterwards was done with care or by someone competent
  kagari appears in it too guess that confirms she is surviving lg
  same weight as the albion but its energy wings are different bs      cg in unicorn was mostly for transformation it was also used other stuff but it was mainly 2d    cg here is just them being cheap

do dreadnoughts have knees
  not /m/ go back to /tg/
yes they couldnt walk otherwise
seconds in google
  boxnaughts no but the other kinds do
    those are air vents air vents i tell you im an engineer ffs
yes
  air vents  in a hydraulics system  you are fucking retarded    dreads have knees
  a good representation of how powerful dreads are in universe  action starts around 555
  its pretty obvious theres no real knees on stuff like 3rded ork dreadz n kanz at least
i honestly kinda like the older ork cancans and eggs with legs more than the current ones
  its called a killa kan anon
  official artwork has them with knees
  im using colloquial language the oldest deff dreads and killa kans were called eggs with legs because of their rotund shapes theres no term like that i know of for the 3rded era kans and dreads which imo are a lot stockier and actually canylooking compared to the modern types
like how can you not love this fella
i think relic asked to extend their legs so they could animate them for the games with their goofy walk animation
even in death i still serve
  they were an awful lot of fun in dawn of war also
  yes but their thighs are very short and the armor is only on their shins which makes up most of their legs
  that opening was great the dread stole the show and gave one of the orks a prostate exam
surely they can just downgrade the killer os to normal dread os
  it would look so fucking much better without those extra panels does the kit really have them able to open like that or is this somebodys custom
  yes its the standard primaris dread
  those panels are open in that pic that thing in the middle is a sarcophagus heres what they look like closed
  i honestly dont know if i like gundam or 40k mechs better  obviously 40k has the a e s t h e t i c but gundams mobile suits just have that awesome maneuverability
  yeah i mean it looks hideous in its normal configuration and looks much better with just the classic sarcophagus    the belly weapons stations arent fantastic looking but at least without the rest of the plates they dont make the whole thing look like a giant walking nose
  why would 40k maneuverability be worse theyre future super tech
  gundams are shaped like people because you are supposed to see them in motion everything in 40k has retarded proportions because theyre supposed to be minifigs
  is it possible to kitbash a cockpit in
  shape need not affect the maneuverability if you have advance tech
  thats really the point of the 40k design aesthetic its ugly as dogshit but once it gets enough momentum get the fuck out of its way whatever it happens to be     gundam and most anime designs are meant to be sleek and hard to hit looking western mecha designs warhammer battletech tend to say to the viewer you better kill me with one shot cocksucker youre not getting another
  what i know yes never tried it tough
  depends ive seen looted dreads with an ork where the sarcophagus is
  even in dead you still have to fight for a living corpse that forbidden you to ever have a robot waifu    why the imperium of men is so shit
  this is not a wellinformed post i could very easily pick multiple machines from 40k in and of itself that do not follow this philosophy the same for anime east vs west is a false dichotomy
why is british scifi always so fucking depressing judge dredd warhammer 40k 1984 its like they expect their world and culture to not exist in about fifty years    and dont give me any of that doctor who crap that doesnt count
  we recognise that even the best of anything has a bit a shit in it makes it more realistic and believable something that some scifi sometimes forgets
  dont forget blakes 7
  
  it was a problem of the times and still largely is i miss optimistic scifi
  perfection
  i love that eldar titans are basically evangelions only with your twin instead of your mom
  some take a whole seer council for a spin
  gundams have jump jets which allow them to leap hundreds of meters in a single bound and change attitude freely in midair even eldar titans arent that agile
rate my contemptor
  i actually really like these guys  i hate the fluff though lol lets just plug our revered warriors into this thing like replaceable batteries
  ornery/contemptible
  get off the drybrush meme and learn how to really paint
  you need to go watch some duncan rhodes painting videos my dude learn the way of thin coats
  it looks perfectly acceptable and if you like it its good
  that fucking red  as a former blood angels player i know that pain what a bitch of color to paint with thin your paint with water to smooth it out it stretches the paint and you dont get ugly brush strokes    and dont be afraid to let it dry and then do a second coat instead of globbing wet onto wet it will look better painting is an exercise in patience
  for those we cherish we die in glory
  i know it was answered further up but im now giggling at the idea of dreadnoughts awkwardly waddling across the battlefield like cotton hill
  the redemptors knees are the only saving grace of it imho and the weapons which i love the looks of

why cant urusei yatsura new release and new dub in the west
  viz is going to start putting out the manga next year at least
  fucking finally
i love urusei yatsura so much
  almost 200 episodes plus ovas of a still relatively obscure show on bluray is a pretty big gamble and nobody would be crazy enough to try to dub it either im surprised animeigo actually released the whole show on dvd singles back in the day    discotek put out beautiful dreamer a while back and viz is going to start rereleasing the manga so buy it up and let them know you want more
  /m/  mecha
  a show making a single mecha related reference makes it /m/ urusei yatsura making like a dozen of them over the course of 190 episodes plus ovas and movies makes it basically an /m/ staple up there with gundam macross and naruto
also lum is so generally infiltrated into scifi and nonscifi anime that shes mostly relevant to everything
why dont you go make these threads on /a/ again you get more traffic on a more popular board i dont want to see this shit still sticking around for months cause /m/ is like 2030 people at most
  uy was basically keroro before keroro but with more of a mix of stuff than keroros gundamheavy references
  nobody gives a shit about the fact that /a/ is faster fuck off
  its already is /m/
  silly no  if it is gundam and ttgl are /co/
  yoshikazu yasuhiko made this is the night of the generals /m/ now
  it would be semi related /m/ like dirty pair
  only if they hade mobile suits

this thread still up  looks like mods really dont exist here which explains a lot
is dr hell a real doctor im beginning to question his legitimacy in the academic world
  he was a perfectly respectable scientist until the whole crabstick thing happened
  i dont think having the surname hell gets you far in the academic world would they really give phds to a guy with an obviously supervillainous name
    that kind of prejudice is outrageous
  im beginning to question his legitimacy in the academic world  indeed how many papers and researches have dr hell published in the last few years
  i like the shin mazinger take he was a brilliant bio physicist and a college professor whose hobby was talking about taking over the world everyone just thought he was goofing until bardos       this one is funny since doom actually dropped out of college and wasnt a real doctor until he forced a lavertian college to give him a doctorate
  lavertian
  yes he has a doctorate in hell
    turns out pandemonium has a really good school system
nevermind that what i wanna know is how he achieved the rank of marshall without any military experience
  i wonder if its actually just a misromanization of herr doktor
  hes german in german hell means light
  to be fair he led an army before he was killed and resurrected as a grand marshall
  why not  hes german so hes just named doctor bright
  i remember watching the hawaii dub with a friend for the hell of it id completely forgotten he was fucking purple in the flashback as well      that reminds me of an episode of challenge of the gobots where they had renegade agents posing as students in the guardian academy  problem was that the gobot naming convention isnt exactly clever so they literally had a guy named traitor in their midst
    well noone who speaks german could be bad
  he has a doctorate whether or not hes a medical doctor is something else entirely
  dont you usually have to be successful in your military campaigns to get that kind of promotion
  he revived 2 dead people and fused them together
  that doesnt mean he went to medical school
    maybe dr hell is like the blue fugates of kentucy and just suffers from a rare skin condition
  thats just silver poisoning
  get this man on contract for live action mazinger
    no it isnt         his wife elizabeth smith2 was a carrier of the recessive methemoglobinemia meth allele as was a nearby clan with whom the fugates intermarried as a result many descendants of the fugates were born with meth345     descendants with the disease gene continued to live in the areas around troublesome creek and ball creek into the 20th century eventually coming to the attention of the nurse ruth pendergrass and the hematologist madison cawein iii who made a detailed study of their condition and ancestry26     cawein treated the family with methylene blue which eased their symptoms and reduced the blue coloring of their skin
  dr hell  dr bright  really makes you think
  yes it is paul karason turned blue from drinking colloidal silver as far as i can tell he has no relationship to the fugate family at all he just happened to be blue too    
  the man literally fused two halves of a couple of halfdead mycenaean together i think he has some credibility
  thats just in shin the original ashura was just a robot
  what the original never went into their backstory but they were never a robot
  pretty sure you can see it in the show when s/he gets hurt just like with brocken
    extreme relationship counseling with radical surgical intervention  economies of scale in giant robot revenge schemes  workplace therapy for patients with disconnective cranial trauma  cultural synthesis through physical synthesis in african tribesmen    this mans published work is groundbreaking
  manga also uses that origin      but are their noble titles valid
  the  koji the

  pygmans body was just voodoo sorcery

g tekakatsu twitter the many ironblooded orphans project are almost complete we will reveal news on all projects on january 6 2019    
if its some pachinko bullshit i will literally killmyself  if its just an anouncement for another anouncement i will punch the monitor
its recap movies  i dont even think most studios will approve 2cour anime anymore unless they know theyll be allowed to make recap movies with 70 recycled animation
many projects you say 
  its recap movies  what if it isnt  whats /m/ gonna do 
  the many ironblooded orphans project are almost complete we will reveal  holy sunrise is pushing ibo hard huh  /m/ might be on suicide watch
  january 6 2019  oh boy cant wait for another announcement
  if its season 3 i will jump out a window you heard it hear /m/
  either this is the first au since ce to get a sequel or its pachinko
  they wouldnt be doing teasers with new models if it was a recap
  its probably gonna be another announcement but you never know crossing fingers
  the many ironblooded orphans project  first macross delta and now this just let it die in peace it cant be salvaged move on for fucks sake
  why would they stop making commercials if they keep selling kits
cant spell tekketsu when its in the link in his own post  eh this translation is probably reliable
  an announcement for a pachinko
  i think sunrise gets more than enough money with their millions of mobile games already
the theory some anon in the other thread gave us about a build divers sequel with ibo gunpla seems to be plausible
  that reminds me the last episode of divers had tons of ibo callbacks no way thats a coincidence
  too bad build divers is pretty much unwatchable its so shit
  banrise licenses ip out to pachinko and pachislot companies too its typically older ips marketed towards those legally old enough to gamble like dragonars big 30th anniversary announcement was a pachinko machine thats not always the case though hell it was earlier this year that the valvrave big announcement ended up being this 
  if build fighters can be ruined by try build divers can just as easily be saved by a good second season
  grasping for straws  how long ago was this contextless image posted
  probably around a decade ago 
but ibo is dead
what will the new barbados be called
  a fucking cape  yeah its build divers alright
  all they have to do is to ditch the shit director but of course that wont happen
  did we watch the same show its not the same magic as fighters but it was pretty decent leagues better fight choreography pacing and writing than ibo
  g tekakatsu  lol
  who was that woman supposed to be  meyrin
  cant be the eye color is different different from lacus eyes too
surely an error in translation
  /m/ wasnt the one bitching about no reveal not fair in a thread was it
how many announcements of announcements do we have so far
  an ova series
  in schedule 1 in total 3
  we had 00 a few months ago followed by ibo and now a bunch more for 40th anniversary hathaways flash origin build n more  lots of gundam onnaway
  straws are somehow less valid the its a recap series asspull
  i dont want a new ibo anime unless it has completely different characters that said i would love an ibo ova with akatsuki atra ride and eugene
  the options for prequels and sequel are ridiculous   i want more fucking angels and blue fire av fights
oh nononononono
can we get a official translation not some google translate shit
    so the middle design is barbatos    but the one on the right looks like the protagonist gundam design if the website teaser was anything to go by    is barbatos getting back seated for another
  what is 00
    it basically is the translation because that same account has been doing this for over a year now    every few months it tweets out one sliver of cryptic nonsense like something will happen in june or plans are coming along and yet nothing of actual substance comes about or gets announced no some random sketch or a oneoff radio broadcast do not an announcement make    full stop if they were doing any form of animation itd be getting promoted like any other animation project and wed already have heard about it by now anyone still acting like anything real is going to happen is either a troll or up at qanon levels of delusional
  the one to the furthest right looks a lot like   pic relate  but the one to the left look more like   pic relate the cape and swords give off more of a fantasy vibe then any of the weapons weve seen in ibo so maybe its a build fighter model   with that said maybe after gjallahorn barbie to the right is stolen and rebuilt or modded like barbie so often is he comes back as some edgy neotekadan rebel figure
  i think the middle is rebuilt rex and the right is another gundam outfitted to look like regular barbatos by tekkadan remnants in other words barbatos vs barbatos
  pic relate shows a atra haired dood wearing a jacket with ryuseigos eye on it  to me he looks younger then some of the main cast was and having him young enough to be eins age would open up more variants of the av to him
  im a noob could someone explain the pachinko meme to me
  that was a false flagger
  then why did they consult with the character designer of ibo earlier this year
  series hype up a announcement and all it ends up being is a pachinko game  code geass recently went through this
  pic relate shows a atra haired dood wearing a jacket with ryuseigos eye on it  thats her son
i really really hope it will be a prequel or 2 i dont want some stupid bullshit movie singular ova or recap    narrative is probably taking up a lot of resources but they need to work on something else other than this ibo is very popular in the west and led to their best sales of gunpla ever in a long time
  this is nothing but good ibo kits were god tier other than the fact they got no mg/pg and all shared a frame they were cheap and good
  the website and twitter page says sequel so probably that
  sounds good to me as long as they dont take themselves too seriously or result to beamspam ill be happy the best part of ibo was the lack of hax/op suits/beamspam
  we need to do away with dáinsleifs too then
    akatsuki surviving from dainsleifs would be kino as fuck
  katsuci will be the one firing the dainsleif rounds
  fuck dainsleifs we need napalm bazookas
  tfw no porn of milf atra
  japan has failed us this is as much as youll get
  not connected to barbatos  disappointing
  beamspam  op suit  oh yeah i love seeing ball of lights crashing each other at lightspeed
for fucks sake if adult akatsuki ends up becoming the post disaster equivalent of full frontal theyve officially run out of ideas
  beamspam isnt an issue shitty fight choreography is  ibo still had plenty of garbage action
  mika is taller    shit
  most adult art has milf atra with tall mikazuki sadly i still have yet to see milf atra rape shota mika fanart
  if the manga is anything to go by hell become a mechanic like mama wants to
  akatsuki becoming full frontal  not ride    comeonnowjpeg
  ride grooms akatsuki into becoming a full frontal
  i still have yet to see milf atra rape shota mika fanart  fuck this earth
      akatsuki would be recruited by rido who has shot up the arms dealer and probobly colaberating with almeria who is going to be char   the real twist is if charma is mikazukiimagine tekadan starts fucking things up getting atra and kudelia his waifus in trouble
  mikazuki is 100 dead confirmed in the manga well not like it needed any confirmation
  only unconscious   never give up hope   how did atra get that bracelet back did gjallahorn give it to her if so wheres the rest of his body wheres his ashes   in a fucking ein jar thats where
  how did atra get that bracelet back  she probably made a new one
  are you ready to be pissed and hyped at the same time    iron blooded orphans is getting a season 3  galahorn killed the pilot of barbados  years later  mikas son stumbles into the war and his fathers unit that was recovered by galahorn and rebuilt  its locked away  similar to what they did with the other unit his brain is inside barbados  mika and his son are going to fully destroy fucking everything that is galahorn
  never give up hope  im sorry anon but its time to move on
  akatsuki recruited to tekadan  nuvidar fenrir its tasked to calm the rebellion  heavily implied this soldier is mikazuki in a 6ft tall in a halfmetal cyborg body  big reveal mask comes off   its fucking hush  there wasnt enough of mika left to salvage him  so they put him into hush  cyberhush is still carrying mikazuki on his back 17 years later  
could be an adaption of gekkou maybe
  you dont know what the devil lady is up to   no one does thats why shes so smiley
   leagues better fight choreography pacing and writing than ibo    lol no
  id love it if she was secretly going full anaheim for both sides
  tells maki to trick gali into putting ein into av  puts ein into rather unique system and rigs him to vidar  gives maki the same oldman av gali got  how is she not and how dont they see this
  wait did she also try and sucker monkey into getting the av so she could beat mika or am i projecting a conversation between her and gali
does anyone really want a continuation of current ibos story i dont really care to see rides revenge what i want is fucking calamity war monster hunting fighting machine wolves while riding robot horses or some shit go full demon knights vs unstoppable angel dragons ive always wanted a more fantasyesque gundam au
  god damn  as much as i like everything about ibos model i just cant stand the bare waist of the machine  its the sole reason i really wish we got the new line soon
  i would way rather watch the creation of the gundam and a angeloftheweek and i am a huge ibo fag
  you could do both if rides revenge leads to calamity war 2 electric boogaloo searching out and repurposing the lost mas merging their tech with ms etc all as giant fuck yous to gjallarhorn until that obviously goes south then you can have everyone desperately figuring out any means to stop this aka break out the museum pieces search the old texts jury rig the broken shit maybe even an ibo equivalent of mountain cycles
  i think a lot of people myself included want to see the formation of gjallarhorn and what agnika and the family founders were like rides story of revenge and possible downfall is not as interesting as watching these basically mythological figures sacrifice their bodies to fight angel robots
  its not that i dont want og angel robot brainjar monhun its more the thought of ibos world story ending on such a lame note after coming from that seems really sour to me id like both and could see it working if you have episodes set entirely in the past giving finer details insight and high moments maybe to draw parallels and differences on how the past and future handle the armageddon situation
  geko isnt worth adapting
  they are pretty ugly desu would be a waste to spend the money to animate imo
  she is the real villain of ibo
  yet people wants frozen teardrop
no
  id love to watch the story of agnika and how elon musk has to stick his only son into a killer robot to fight the ai that has been unleashed on the world
the only way to save ibo at this point is to have a season 3 as far removed from everything as possible or have it be a soft reboot in the form of the zeta movies and continue from there     have mcretard actually be powerhungry and crazy because the bael actually is a super dangerous gundam with a hax ability like controlling the mobile armours or something and have it be like agnika was hailed as a war hero when it was actually him being a retarded dictator with a chuuni keikaku that would allow him to control the world in the future but his plan went tits up because it was retarded after all except mcretard falls for it and goes along with it and due to exposure to the av system on bael he develops schizophrenia while agnika tries to control him from beyond the bael    meanwhile after the hamsal encounter half of the tekkadan realise how dangerous these things are and beg orga to instead completely shift focus on eliminating eevry one of them since they cant forever rely on mika and hos busted style of suicide via thousand battles infighting ensues and the group splits in two with mika and orga as the leaders of the first group still chasing the tekkadan dream and another group who stays behind with the intention of surviving as a family and prepare to survive a possible impending apocalypse of angel dragon due to that akihiro decides to pursue lafters affection and she accepts so the turbines dont kill her but that makes them swear revenge on iok all the same and they have to search another manufacturer for parts and repairs etc at this point the name of volco warren starts getting dropped around the camp    the rest of the events continue in a similar fashion except now mcgillis loses to gaelio and reaches rustal on the bridge before getting shot
  then rustal secures the bael but notices how several people give him conflicting reports about the damn thing and one of the foremen in charge of storing it calls him personally down after he goes to check the gundam its revealed that mcgillis former crew are actually posing as the workers there and put him in the baels cockpit in order for rustal to get fuly brainwashed and become the second agnika agnirustal then slowly excavates all the mobile armours and builds a new empire with him as dominant world leader with the bael as his personal unit and the angel dragons as his guardians and imperia of certain provinces    years pass and now enter the new tekkadan led by volco who now acts as monster hunters and take down mobile armours all over the world often using their scrap to further upgrade their own gundams in order to not go full potato like mika did by using excessive force and pimping out their mechas    ibo season 3 is gundam hunters vs angel dragons    its utterly retarded and impossible but compared to what we got from mainline gundams these few years its a masterpiece plus it has gunpla potential and you could make an entire new set of vidya based on it alone without needing the gundam breaker tag
  barbatres
  fenrir like kimaris vidar
  laugh at you for calling it/m/ and not /m/
  its cagalli      its an edit from pic related
  barbatos angelus
  they killed all the popular characters who the fuck wants a sequel to this fucking mess
  they killed all the popular characters  not quite if the gundam poll with the 100 most popular characters is anything to go by theres still atra and gaelio and im sure akatsuki could become a fan favorite too if they do him right
  neither of them ranked well
  they killed all the popular characters who the fuck wants a sequel to this fucking mess  if we dont see a body then mika is pretty much okay if that fag kira yamato can survive a nucler explosion then why wouldnt mikas head miss the blade part of whats her faces weapon 
  gaelio was 16 and atra 90 or so better than kudelia at least
  the manga already has mikazuki confirmed he is dead same with the data book its over anon he is dead
    63  gaelio  89  atra
gotta wait for the next announcement for them to make another announcement
  data book  source since your ass doesnt count
  gjallarhorn doesnt have much of a presence out there
all theyd need to do for s3 is make the gundam equivalent of monster hunter sell kits of the mas you can cannibalize for weapons and armor for the gundams bandai would make money hand over fist
  be sunrise  make gtekketsu / ibo  its shit  memes abound all over the net  people actually like the calamity war and salvage aspect of the show  have byking make gundam games for bandai your parent company  bandai already has a monster hunter studio with shift  the various gundam versus games over the years had a sort of mission mode where you could face off against mobile armours and gain exp points to unlock more suits / power up  never thinking of making a gvg game focused only on ibo with mobile armours as the monsters that you have to kill to farm equipment pieces like in monhun    how can you piss such a big opportunity right there especially when they could have developed it when monhun world hadnt dropped and the people would have eaten it up because it would be a console hunting game such a fucking waste
  the only good thing about ibo is mika being a mc in a gundam making babies the closest one is amuro in ln only and shiro
has this report been confirmed yet seems fake
  that looks more like a what if story then actual confirmation the water gun was dead give away
  angel of the week with increasingly awesome loadouts  if they did this after ibo then you could have crazy dansleif machine guns/ revolvers  maybe they would even eventually create an angel with a beam sabre beak that can cut thru nanolaminate at melee range but not long range which opens the universe to more bad ass sounding laser weapons
  is ride contacting the dead and guess who is there
i love the io frames
mikazuki is still alive as he is barbatos now screen cap this
  if this is true then yamagay is confirmed next pilot of flauros and yamagay will see naked shinos newtype ghost
  i wonder if gutz gundam is going to have one giant arm since atland is going to have a halfmetal arm in the next season
this guy from narrative is david schiller right  
  no the character designer is just an unimaginative hack
  schiller  are we sure he isnt trying to sell us something

  hey guys i namedropped a random character from an obscure manga do i fit in yet  retard
trailer leak   facebook com/gundamitalianclub/posts/1988159241263987
wow  sand
  and then people said gundam its not star wars with mech
  what could this post possibly be referring to  watches the trailer  oh sand
  i dont like sand  hathaway
  very nice animations but cg mech in the end bad sunrise really bad
  that was definitely the penelope at the end isnt winter 2019 just a few months from now in japan though
damn this was very encouraging very ominous feeling seems like theyre going to lean into this narrative as a tragedy     not sure about that cg hathaway though       next winter
that dramatic music  hyped
doesnt hathaways flash only have like four mobile suits in it gonna be kinda hard to work in fights if their gonna straight up adapt it into three movies
  its an adaptation they can switch out or add mobile suits if they like
that framing and cinematography looked really good and the amount of ambient detail they included was pretty impressive for something still almost a year away i think like everything else were going to see quite a bit of character cg as well as mechanical cg but the latter has improved quite a bit in theatrical work mazinger infinitys high points were the mech battles and those were all cg for example the xi and penelope are complex enough that i can definitely see how going cg on them would be preferrable look forward to seeing more
  filename    and a capicola soprasetta to you too
  lol youtubedl names it based on the page it pulls from
  you didnt get a single word though
  mortadella rigatoni
  capicola  gabagool give it here
they better not change the themes
  when did bright become freddie mercury
  or the ending for that matter
  of course xi/penelope are going to be cg
  kono pressure  
  actually its weird that feddie men dont have more facial hair since they wear spacesuits and thus dont need to worry about putting on gasmasks during chemical attacks
aside from shield liger and the mechs from nadesico do other mechs have the make a force field and just ram the guy attacks
  mechs  anyway layzner arguably does it but thats the only other one i can think of where its actually ramming    the fmp mecha do seem to be able to weaponize their own barriers i think but they dont ram
  the sdf1 technically did it with the daedalus attack
  i was under the impression that divine crusader units with a tesla drive can use that for ramming attacks
  jesus christ its a lion
  who needs a force field
  gundam xi uses a force field to make itself more aerodynamic
  fmp have the most  i dont have to explain shit  plot device ever  i mean  do we even know ever how a fucking lambda drive works
  quantum nanomachine space magic just like everything else
does getta shine count
  pinpoint barrier concentration is moreorless the melee attack choice for all macross series afterwards from valkyries to macrosses
so was yang a racist or what
  can we all agree kircheis was a career shitposter though
most chinamen are to some degree
  the unnecessary i mean that wasnt in the original dialogue nor fits with the olde english  image was definitely made by an american
  nah he was just based
  a based retard some would say
  that bit where yang said he would consider the idea of a yang administration as long as he could put the final solution on blacks into practice  damn who couldve thought the discount space nazis would turn out to be the good guys when compared to the fpa
  why does /m/ draw in so many /pol/tards
  i knew raimi cooperating with ishiguro on screenwritiing would cause some issues but this is too much
  thats pretty brutal
whatever happened to that logh remake i thought it was airing for like two month and then just kinda dropped dead
  finished man
  man this looks weird after being so used to the old one art style seems fine just weird
  it finished its first season i believe were getting a couple of movies and based on the reception to all of those well get the rest of the novels adapted
  this is on par with ideon movie
  bonk  zzzzzzzap
  absolutely so      remember where you are
  how about fuck right off to reddit where you belong /pol/tard
  it was solid little to talk about until the next stuff rolls out and that material is being released theatrically like yamato 2199    well other than the fact that we got blueballed super hard with the assumed to be triglav featuring in the opening when the first season models itself after the first volume of the books in terms of narrative progression triglav is a no show until what third volume
  after admiral kircheis death shitposting on the barbarossa fleetnet went down by 80  people concluded the shitposters stopped in honor of the late admiral
  you seem confused am i being memed on
  back to /pol/ with you
  listen sweetie browsing 4chan youre gonna see lots of swear words and insults so next time just close the tab when youre offended and save yourself the time
  go back
  yikes
  i agree with him leave this place      the space nazis already purged everyone in a nazilike fashion

whats your favourite album of 2018 so far    and yeah i know what board im on

  you guys probably have better taste in music though
    stairway to valhalla by nanowar of steel
i posted a robot on the music board and they called me a faggot
i dont listen to new music
  weird i thought they liked grimes
  they just wanna fuck her thats different
  and you guys dont wanna fuck mech
  the armored core 20th anniversary album that soft confirmed ac6 with new tracks  duh
  depends on the mech of course
  /mu/ just like every other altnormie community only likes nge

what would the ingredients for a good american adaptation of ghost in the shell be would it be best served sticking to the sillier tone of the original manga being animated
  good american adaptation of   adaptations of visual mediums by hollywood dont work
hire chris cunningham  
if its animated it just needs to be an ova thats really super close to the ps1 game cutscenes    if its liveaction it needs to be made in 1992 by paul verhoeven cause hes really good at combining ultraviolent action comedy and social commentary and stuff    ito did a fine job of compressing the puppetmaster arc so he can certainly come up with a solid script that stays true to the manga if he doesnt have oshii holding his leash but if its gonna tackle that storyline it needs to be way more explicit about the taoist yiching nonsense that supports all that stuff and end in a more climactic way where the bad guys from s6 are punished for real and the good guys from gavel get rewarded     oh and also kurutan and her weird gary numan fanboy of a boss need to make an appearance    it needs the sfx team behind the 95 judge dredd movie at the very least and parsimonious amounts of cgi    it needs shirows direct input on costume design and production design    and of course it needs athletic charismatic actors who can look serious but can also act goofy such as lucy lawless and arnold
also this hairstyle on the ol shousa
pretty much  this is also why well likely never see it as its neither focus group or market target safe
  just do like any other adaptation americanize it add racial diversity to cater to the sjw like making l in death note black put one liners and explosions everywhere instant success which means that it was a good american adaptation
  good  american  adaptation    pick 2

post relevant information since the last thread that took place years ago
  is that anon ever around anymore they used to ask into this which prompted that thread but i cant say ive seen evidence of them in a long time or is it you
  i cant confirm or deny that but i will say that anon definitely stopped showing up for a couple of years
  posting whatever i could find from the previous threads
  i can see why that anon was into this
  broadest chest ive ever seen
  now to see if itll pick up steam
  that is a man not a boy
threads like these remind me of that nipple removing anon from years ago    seriously the lack of nipples irks me why cant they even depict men with them
  why would an anon remove nipples when there arent any to being with    anyway the pic i posted has that most of the time it just dont look good animators have one less thing to remember and you never see the areola just a circle
  i see    also was referring to a /fit/  thread where the op just posted pictures of men with their nipples shooped off
  should compile them into a second chart instead making it too long
patlabor
shirtless boys of /m/
  youre an anon of culture i see
nudity can really represent somethings in fiction about people in giant humanoid robots
  
      and hes supposed to be 14
  ill be back in a few hours
  are we really going to let this thread die
well i have a shirtless picture of a kamen rider somewhere
  someone should add daitarn 3 with banjo in his underwear
/m/marvel comics thread    ultron is /m/ as hell
  you mean pym
  machineman is awesome some great jack kirby art there
marvels had some damned good mechanical designs over the decades ive recently taken a liking to lord iron in particular
roms design waseh but the story was some kickass shit
those uk zoids comics were marvel werent they  also deaths head is pretty cool
real soviet bulk
    its the boxy robotic head and chest mixed with muscled limbs its really odd looking and seems like a guy in a lazy costume rather than an actual robot or mechanical life
they even have a giant robot that they pretty much dont use
kirby did a few robots i like sentry better than the sentinels
is there a geewunner equivalent to gundam
burgers grew up with wing
  ucfags
so he was a char clone afterall
  production order fags  i would not have made it thru uc if i didnt get 80 and 83 before zeta straight up   with that said origin didnt exist yet /
  or oywfags
  oyw fags are the worst and have completely ruined my enjoyment of the oyw with the constant super secret oyw gundams and never before seen zeon super weapons
  pref90uc to be precise some dont count anything after hathaway
  production order holds its merit for pretty much everything too though
tomino uc fags and oyw fags    the later is more annoying because theyre the kind that expect hard scifi grunt kind of stuff out of gundam and shit on anything thats not tacticool
  i did you are weakass bitch
  this
geewunner  but isnt most modern transformers media eternally rehashing geewun anyways so youre stuck with marvel/sunbow derivatives no matter the iteration
  you say that like a lot of modern gundam media doesnt rehash early uc elements    so youre stuck with marvel/sunbow derivatives no matter the iteration  is that similar to rx78 analogues and derivatives being shoehorned in
  not so much thats more comparable to the early japanese series like headmasters masterforce and victory that kept old elements while implementing new ones like gundam aus often do  now transformers is literally the same characters over and over it would be like if every new animated series or comic was just the white base crew in different scenarios not homages to those characters literally those characters
  yeah its true i was talking about macross and mentioned it with mechs that turn into planes and friends were like so like gundam
others only exposure to gundam is wing with patricians having seen endless waltz
  i grew up with g gundam
  i dont even think beast wars would thrive if it was introduced today  can you imagine how bad the trukk not munky backlash would be in todays cancerous age
  blame this on the misfortune of your production
    is there a single longrunning franchise that isnt doing that in the internet era
    i think its because there was a time where an action show could actually form a primary following of new young viewers like beast wars did but now it seems every action/drama oriented cartoon has to at least partially pander towards an older audience to break even resulting in inevitable nostalgia fuel
  can you imagine how bad the trukk not munky backlash would be in todays cancerous age    fair point
    itd probably have terrible fart jokes and try and use slapstick thats never funny
  uc sticklers obviously particularly zeon shills theyre the reason we havent gotten original villains
  theres a ton of tf stuff over the years that pulled in a new younger audience rescue bots is literally for tiny babbies its simply that transformers at this point more or less is g1 and those scenarios characters and situations are the principle story to be told one way or another
  oyw gets a lot of exposure to be fair  id love some zeta and zz era grunt pov shit
  if we go by toys the anime line unlike the new mps theyre not 100 fitful to the designs and combine a bit of modern flair with them
  can you imagine how bad the trukk not munky backlash would be in todays cancerous age  it would just be anons making fun of optimus and saying shit like  tfw the new optimus transforms into a nigger
  they already blew it with aoz im pretty sure    if bandai has a good thing going with anything gundam theyre bound to milk it until theres nothing of worth left    see uc2 nt
  super secret oyw gundams and never before seen zeon super weapons    this shit is the worst almost none of the oyw gaiden shit even aesthetically fits it all looks way more advanced than it should be
  bright clone actually  they were both voiced by hirotaka suzuoki
  revive transtech
  fuck they want black representation even in transformers
it is time for everyone to be muh nigga    some dude scanned his copies just now     
  did the artist do porn i swear ive seen that girls design in an old doujin where she turned into a demoness that killed the people who raped her in sadistic and cruel ways
someone browse through this and tell me if the introspective sequences of van can actually be found in the manga i wanna know if escaflowne actually took something from nge or if it was part of the story from the getgo
  some dude scanned his copies just now    no it is the same scans we had fucking 4 years ago when i read it    fucking hell /m/ sure is dumb
why do some people hate ttgl with such a fiery passion to the point of calling it objectively bad  im in this fb mecha group where a dude who seems like a long timer never misses an oportunity to trash talk the show i know 1 person / general consensus but comments like this float around a lot
  its cringethe show
    because assholes like you keep making threads like this whining whenever someone doesnt like your show
    ok there goes my wish of getting mature replies
  why do some people hate ttgl with such a fiery passion to the point of calling it objectively bad  because its popular you dont really think theres anything deeper than it having mainstream popularity do you
  because gurren lagann is filled with toxic masculinity
  cause ttgl fags refuse to watch any other /m/ show
    if you want mature replies maybe next time make a mature op
  its been ten fucking years why do you give a shit the company made lost most of the people who did it and the new guys just make crappy shows about teenage angst    it was a flash in the pan show that some liked some didnt and its over now it was a polarizing show with a way to vocal fanbase granted there has been rei vs asuka shitposting for decades now
  rei vs asuka will carry on as well likely till the end of time
  theres a longstanding reputation that ttgl fans dont watch other mech shows which harms the show because that mecha otherwise tends to have fairly insular but also generally educated fandom this is particularly damning in its detractors eyes because ttgl is supposedly heavily inspired by/shamelessly rips off concepts and styles from other mech shows the most common ones ive seen are getter and to a much lesser extent ggg basically when you have a bunch of people coming in a saying something is the greatest mech show ever when youve seen its shit dozen times already only this time its in a different color of paint youre going to be understandably annoyed
  its a reaction to the legions of retards whove only seen it praise it as the only good mecha show and refuse to watch anything else see also evangelion
    so its not like ttgl itself being bad rather the fans being close minded giving the show and genre itself a bad name i understand now thank anons for giving an explained answer
  because its popular
  this desu
  oh shit
  yikes
  some of these people are pretending to be upset about posts/threads that were made ten years before they even browsed this site its just a knee jerk reaction thats been pressed upon them dont take it personally op
  came to vaguely imply this ty
  im in this fb mecha group  omg gtf  i dont care about your social media drama
  because he has a different opinion why cant fanboys take another persons opinion at their word why do you assume theres always an ulterior motive i watched ttgl most gundam shows and legend of the galactic heroes and i didnt become a fanboy of any of them despite the constant fanboying on /m/ or otherwise they werent my thing     theres nothing inherently wrong with them but i just find these shows kind of boring and slow and not enough stimulating material to keep me entertained
  ggg  nice meme  folks who mentioned that one havent done their homework
muh getter
  cuz when that was on air on demand had armored trooper votoms
   exactly they act like its the best ever and wont take any recommendations for good mecha shows
i love yoko
  i can say for sure that ive jizzed at least a gallon of semen to her
because its popular among people who dont necessarily watch other mecha series
  oh please using clawshrimpy as an example of an average sjw is about as accurate as saying /pol/ represents the average rightwinger both examples give their side a bad name and bring much shame/dishonor to their families
  easy its an entrylevel show with some solid animation that got really popular in the mainstream anime crowd   that in itself isnt a bad thing but  being as it is  it has a bad habit of bringing normies and the most supreme of autists into its fanbase which in turn makes interacting with the series in any way other than watching fucking unbearable
      i believe its the opposite they are newfags who watched ttgl and only after they discovered other mecha shows in particular getter and then pretend to be connoisseur of the genre by screaming how ttgl is just a copy of the good ole mecha shows of yesteryear  anyone who already had a good grasp of mecha before ttgl enjoyed the references and jokes and had a blast for the most part  that said  im in this fb mecha group  
  because its popular and was considered a gateway mecha anime kinda like how gundam wing was a gateway mecha anime of its time and people get tired of hearing about it
why is that ttgl eva and code geass are always the go to shows for i dont really like mecha anime but
  because they were decent and their popularity snowballed they dont do anything particularly different ok eva does but its inspired a bunch of clones by now its just a meme that they do and nobody bothers branching out
  thats said about almost every new and popular mecha show people see the genre as nothing but gundam and macross and dont give it a real try because they think its inaccessible
  i think part of it is also that a lot of people dont like the mechanical/science fiction setting or look i was never big into fantasy with fancy cgi pentragrams and shit but throw steam purges and metal straining noises my way and im happy some people are going to be the opposite
  they dont do anything particularly different ok eva does but its inspired a bunch of clones by now  what did eva do differently
      this exchange eloquently sintethyzes the essence of the four chanels
  because its popular and was considered a gateway mecha anime kinda like how gundam wing was a gateway mecha anime of its time and people get tired of hearing about it    gundam wing is genuinely terrible though
  this may be one of the most horseshit charts ever made
  ive done the same my friend
  mecha anime /m/ likes  putting literally anything in that column
  isnt that what the shitposters tell us constantly though that /m/ will watch any show with robot in it
  /m/ will watch any show with a robot in it /m/ will not like anything whatsoever  you have to watch it in the first place to bitch about it
people like to shit on it because its more popular than their favorite show and they like to pretend mecha is a secret club that you cant enter unless youve seen every 1970s japanese toy commercial
  im in this fb mecha group  stop
  aaahhhhhhhhhhh
  /a/  liking fafner  what the hek ive seen like three threads about fafner on /a/ and ive made 2 of them another was about a fellowss waifu of a decade dying when exodus was airing  im pretty sure /a/ doesnt know the show exists
i can never get through it because less than halfway in i just hate all the characters ive dropped and picked it up and dropped it again more time than i care to admit so i cant really comment on its quality  but the fanbase used to be really toxic factor in the fact it was a lot of peoples gateway into /m/ and it doesnt get much more elitist and gatekeepy than than the /m/ crowd and it was a perfect storm of backlash
  it used to be that youd get bullied if you said you like gunbuster on /m/
  shows with cool mecha are liked by /v/ good for them
  it doesnt get much more elitist and gatekeepy than than the /m/ crowd  the social media tier mecha crowd probably ive always seen welcoming posts to newfags here
  its just as cringe as getter robo desu
wtf since when was ttgl hated bunch of newfags
  when you keep making the same thread over and over why would you expect new responses its been ten fucking years do the code geass faggots do this     hey guys i know that code geass aired back in 2006 but why didnt you like it
  fb mecha group    have 1 more you you fucking swine
  backlash to shit getting popular
        so a show is bad not because of its own issues but because its fans doesnt listen to you you complete morons you stupid fucking mongrels  the reason you hate ttgl isnt because they killed off the interesting protagonist or the cringey shit that gave birth to memes or because the two seasons were pretty much two different shows or its pros not appealing to you no the reason you hate it is because its fans wont take your hot opinions  alright then lets hear it what should they watch
  so a show is bad not because of its own issues but because its fans doesnt listen to you  none of those actually say anything about the quality of the show friend  killed off the interesting protagonist  kaminas only purpose in the narrative was to be a role model for the rest of the cast so they can overcome their flaws he wasnt actually all that interesting on his own because he was an already selfactualised person  the two seasons were pretty much two different shows  it actually did a pretty good job reinventing itself carrying the character arcs forward naturally with the setting and expanding on the earlier concepts like the adai village culls and the origins of genome in a neat way
i can tell you for sure that if ttgl aired in the 70s or 80s it would be considered an /m/ classic
  you are so right its almost sad
  and a ps4 would be considered a great machine if it was released at the same time as the magnavox odyssey  fucking dipshit
none of those actually say anything about the quality of the show friend    thank you for stating my point    kaminas only purpose in the narrative was to be a role model for the rest of the cast so they can overcome their flaws    kamina was a dumb guy who used bravado to hide his insecurities and was the one relying on others despite appearances but even if he were a cardboard cutout of a hotblood hed still work viewers were pumped whenever he appeared he was fine as is and much as people like to complain about bland mcs as long as the situation and supporting cast continue to evolve the show continues to be engaging hell there are good shows where the plot unfolds by having the mc remain the same while dismantling the setting
      whoopsy daisy        youre missing his point and yet youre calling him a dipshit
  what else is there to get out that shitpost of a statement  dont tell me were still pretending that /m/s general mindset is old good new bad  more and more shows are getting translated these days and people realise just how terrible some of those classics truly are  i wouldnt wish shows like tekkaman tobikage or dairugger to my worst enemies
    he meant if ttgl was produced in the 70s/80s with the quality of that time not with todays  lurk more and youll come across a lot of idiots or a few very vocal ones celebrating stuff such as the original mazinger z and the robot romance trilogy as masterpieces that eclipse todays productions when in truth they are unholy awful in everything from sound recording quality to script to anything you can name    tekkaman    the original one or blade
  the robot romance trilogy is still pretty watchable desu but i see what you mean and you are right
  whenever those get mentioned its less about this is a fantastic show for the ages that our grandchildren will enjoy and more of a they arent worth the cels they were drawn on but we acknowledge them for creating the fundament that future shows are made on deal hence why most people tell you to only really watch selected episodes of the original mazinger z or to drop combattler after the first half  the only real place youll find those unironic man they dont make them like they used to posts is in the comment sections of ops from shows that people used to watch in their childhood but probably never again afterwards  sorta what happened to me ages ago when i got my hands on the dvd box of mask which i remembered liking a lot as a kid but in the end i couldnt even make it past the first disc
  i wouldve laughed if attack on titan was on /a/ column
  who liked total eclipse who i dont know of a single person who said anything more positive about it then it was alright but
  i enjoyed it
2nd half is pure garbage
  it took the tropes of the mech protags and genderbent them
still no transforming arc gurren  chouginga toy shame
  i cant shes instantly killed my boner since day 1 and im not sure why    mazinger z  unholy awful in everything  looks like someone cant appreciate the sluttury of gochy for the work of art it truely is
all the important stuff i wanted to say in this thread has been said except  1 the comedy in the series pretty much died when kamina did  2 srw og makes better character expies anyway and does better on pretty much everything else
  dont forget kamina typically got the last laugh in everything he did even till the end    were going to the surface everyone ridiculed him but he was proven right  im gonna pilot that ganmen he was laughed at but he still did it anyway  were gonna combine it looked to be a failed attempt but he succeeded more like unlocked hidden power but still  well make that huge battleship into our base he may have given his life to accomplish this but it still happened    and this was all before the rediscovery of spiral power by humanity
  you know very well how impossible that is lol
  chouginga can go with jark scheme  seaprate shoulder drills
  come to think of it the jark thing could work but the whole transformation is just insane to begin with
  wing is one of the most underrated comedies of all time
  fuck you you cuntrairian idiot mazinger z still has a better opening arc than anything else made in the last ten years just because you cant anything that isnt lifeless shitty digipaint isnt the shows fault
        you realize the transformable chouginga is undergoing development right now right
  /a/ hates diebuster or they used to
  if you diss gainax and trigger again i will cut you
why does ttgl cause such stupid arguments every time its brought up why cant we just get along the show was made as a loveletter to mecha shows why cant you have fun with it are you that cynical
  loveletter to mecha shows  you need to know other mecha shows before understanding that
  i mean i think it works really well on its own as well i originally saw it before a lot of other mecha shows but now that ive seen them and get the references i appreciate them more while also enjoying the show itself quite a lot  i fucking love getter robo now but that doesnt stop me from also loving ttgl
great thing arrives  everyone loves it and cant stop getting a hardon  its older now and hits mainstream  4chan hates it    happens every single time whenever something becomes popular
  s older now and hits mainstream  it was mainstream from the minute it dropped mate it was one of those i dont really watch anime/mecha but you gotta check this out shows like what happened with attack on titan where it memed itself into getting people to watch it who wouldnt normally
  of course it does the problem with most of the detractors is that unlike you discovered the other shows without necessarily watching them and then in order to sound knowledgeable shit over ttgl saying that it just copied older shows  the same things begin said with evangelion and ultraman but with ttgl being way more obvious in its parodies and references you get a lot more newfags noticing it but not understanding them    yeah so much that 80 of the posts are about gundam such a niche and unknown series
  just like eva its liked by a lot of plebbitards  and i dont even like mecha
  i dont know about you guys but i just watched it because i like robots with drills
  except im a ttglfag and ive watched a bunch of mecha shows afterwards on the contrary gurren lagann made me into a fan of the mecha genre
  theyre just being contrarian or maybe they liked it but couldnt let go of the fact that the fandom was cancerous during the shows height i mean i loved the show but i have to admit that the fandom at the time dampened the appeal of the show for me
  i no longer feel anything for this i just laugh
im i missing something here  the only thing showing any kind of energy is the fucking op
  thats because the studio behind this show  trigger  dont really understand tokusatsu shows hence why you see everyone give bored impressions
  you know tsuburayas coproducing this with trigger right and the chief writer is a guy whos been writing for ultraman since tiga
  you know tsuburayas coproducing this with trigger right  and yet characters act completely uninterested the only thing people even actually talk about is the yuri shipping
  coproducing     i do believe thats fancy talk for my name is on the project therefor i make money without actually doing anything
  like their bored what
  he needs generic autistic anime screaming in every episode  maybe you should just go back to battle shounen
  yeah your english lessons fuck outta here esl faggot come back when youve learned english you thirdworld monkey      you need to go back to school kid
  they act like real people if you hadnt dropped out of school in first grade and actually interacted with others you would know
  if it wasnt for the yuri shipping this show would be completely ignored by the megamajority of fans
  tsuburaya is a lot more involved than you think the shows screenwriter is keiichi hasegawa also chief writer of ultraman dyna and ultraman nexus and has written for every ultra series from tiga through ginga and nearly every ultraman movie of the 2000s gridmans design was designed by masayuki goto the guy who also designed ginga victory x orb geed not to mention the other kaiju designers like ichiro itano yes that ichiro itano hiroshi maruyama and shinji nishikawa
  they act like real people  you must not go out if you think thats how real people actoh this is /m/ you probably dont
  he doesnt even know why anon was criticizing his grammar
  anime based off a tokusatsu series  not on the same level as a battle shounen  fuck off rikka/akanefag
  literally nothing is worse than battle shounen
  seamonkeys dont count as real people  is that what these characters are 
  again fuck off rikka/akanefag secondary scum
  im a gridmanfag actually
  youre a rikka/akanefag watching the show for the girls who has never seen an actual tokusatsu in your life
  nope im watching for sweet justice and kaiju extermination no need to get so upset friend
i thought esl shitposting already dead since last month    just go back and stick around with your local weeb circle in facebook op
  just stop texting dumbass that sentence really hurting my eyes
  hey not shit talk a whole genre theres always something good in every one of themexcept moe slice of life they are a load of nothing
  im watching for sweet justice and kaiju extermination  my man
why do we have to have one of these stupid fucking contrarian threads every other day just post in the ongoing thread and get btfod there instead
  harem romance
  i agree with you op this show is straight up trash its the modern kikaider anime of a generations as a fan of gridman im pretty disappointed in this also too many fags and yes men in /m/ need to btfo
  whats a bored  when did the characters get them  what does a bored act like
  the reactions are kinda subdued more than usual fare but unless youre an autist you should be be able to recognize different emotions even if you think think the protagonist trio acts like they are always bored i dont see how you could interpret anti or akane like that  the only thing showing any kind of energy is the fucking op  what the fights and finishers are great
    you are probably referring to the resident autistic yurifag from the gridman threads on /a/ and /u/ also known as you yeah that one guy keeps samefagging spamming and replying to himself to fake a discussion not to mention that he keeps ban evading despite always getting banned and getting his deleteted posts 354 posts in the current thread on /a/    reply to your own post doesnt make it true    i really dont understand why you decided to shit on /m/ again none of us have forgotten that yuri thread about gridman you made last week in /m/  let me warn you mentally ill yurifags like you arent welcome here and will never be welcome here so go back to hell from whence you came resident autistic yurifag from /a/ and /u/
    i dont know if i love or hate the fact that they kept zenons arms jointless just like the toys or did they actually want robologs for arms and the toys were created accordingly
  the trigger guys love old trsnsformimg robot toys its a tribute to that
  hi henry
because at that point they still dont get what the fuck is going on
  hi resident yurifag from /a/ and /u/ i really like how you /u/tards always like to play the victim and hide behind a imaginary boogeyman to justify their own shit
the list of uc and not uc titles
wheres gsavior
  someone make it in english
  its almost entirely in english already
judau ashta   age 14  roux louka  age18  nice
  does this mean hes ascended beyond a chad
  the only person that is on judaus pussy game is uso
  uso was sexually the target of almost every female character in victory    judau might be in second but theres a big lead    that said why do the youngest gundam protags have mad game is the uc just at a point where /ss/ is common place
  lots of people died in the oyw and the population never really recovered and it fucked the social norms
  wasnt he 15
  no 14
  newtypes clearly produce some kind of new pheromone thats strength correlates with how strong of a newtype they are
  is the zeta blushing
roux is by far the best girl out of any gundam series
  was this what tomino meant by age of onesan
  wrong  roux was 16 at the time of her first appearance in zz and she turned 17 at the end  shes born in sep 17 0071
  meanwhile the reverse  gyunei guss  age 19  quess   age 13  and he called char a pedo
  13 years  pedo
  nigga that barely skirts ephebophile did they lower the age of consent in uc cause even in the eu its 14 at the lowest
  depends on their restriction
cross ange is just dumb fun    really because this seems pretty fucking dire so far     episode two and so far theyve had two brutal deaths and at least two rapes     did someone misspell completely fucked as dumb fun
its not dumb fun so much as its so outwardly terrible that it becomes an entertaining train wreck
  its so outwardly terrible that it becomes an entertaining train wreck    and also inwardly terrible
  keep going
think you might have misinterpreted what the dumb fun was referring to
  i like to think that the real terribleness was the friends ange made along the way
  except hilda right
im an entire 2 episodes into this 1226 episode series 167 of the way through and its not like you guys said this series was like at all    every time
  it gets considerably less grimderp as it goes on
  episode two and so far theyve had two brutal deaths  ah yes that was fucking delicious
dont take your robot cartoona ao seriously
  rape  prostrate examination is not rape especially when your tight ass breaks the prosthetic arm of the jailer
  i bet you also pause two minutes into the movie and complain about it on /tv/ like every poster there    that was the last time something like this happens then its about salias slutty sailormoin fantasy and ange being lesbian male rapist
    i hate to break it to you buy women dont have prostates and that guy wasnt a doctor
  implying women dont fart  implying i wasnt the prostrate examiner in first place
    what a twist
  guy
  the fukuda influence become more apparent in later episodes i think the first three episodes had minimal influences by fukuda and the writers/director being going full grimdark edgy
  based fukuda saving cross ange by making it go full clownshoes
  i cant figure out how someone can believe such a stupid fucking thing fukuda was in shit with the morality police like the entirety of seeds airing for underage sex and graphic death scenes boiling blood exploding people etc in an evening timeslot and responded even then by making them more graphic in the tv movie version cross ange is over the top with this stuff because anime has generally become cleaner in the meantime and he really wanted to flip them off
  its not a medical exam its to ensure that ange isnt smuggling a brick of cocaine into the island up her asshole
  pick up gundam seed because everyone said its cross ange 05  everythings different except for jesus yamato and a few seconds of the op  you lied to me /a/
you gotta break angelise down first so she can come back as ange the most glorious cunt to ever cunt about in a giant robot
  cross ange is seed if fllay was the mc and she finds out that she is everything she hated
  cross ange is over the top with this stuff because anime has generally become cleaner in the meantime and he really wanted to flip them off  except this isnt even remotely fucking true hell cross ange didnt even bother to have fucking nipples in the bds something even shounen series do
  congratulations op you fell for the le epik trainwreck maymey
  and responded even then by making them more graphic in the tv movie version  based
    that was a really weird choice i dont know why they did just leave the random floating steam in or just not have exposed breasts it kind of makes me wonder if people just dont have nipples in this world
  thats probably why he said prostrate
  come back to us when youre on episode 4 or 5    seriously remember madoka remember its just a cute magical girl show and then episode three and shit started getting grimderp this is the reverse
  madoka was terrible very bad example
  ange isnt much better objectively it just benefits from being a farce
  guy  jailer was a lady who frisked anges anus
  it was an excellent anime though
  embryo was probably a loser who never saw tits before he remade the world so he didnt add nipples to the new humans
  women dont have prostates    sounds like someone needs to go back to biology class
    iirc fukuda said they didnt have the budget to add nipples in every topless shot in the bds so they just didnt do it at all
    thats weird i wonder why they did it that way the usual mo is to just draw them in and then stick an effect over the top to hide them thats why you can sometimes see them by fucking with the contrast etc of a screenshot from the broadcast version if theyve been lazy about it
    fukuda is a true genius by not drawing nipples he saved the shows production 5 million dollars
i liked salamanlanadelrey but still feel she switched sides too soon
    does she actually switch sides isnt everyone fighting against embryo in one way or another although most of the arsenal people dont actually know that they are
  come back to us when youre on episode 4 or 5    you could describe the show after a certain point as fun but the first two episodes weigh it down it cant really recover from the tone set by the start of the show the tone changes but that doesnt mean the first two episodes dont color things
  episode two and so far theyve had two brutal deaths and at least two rapes  this is pretty fun
  its sex and violence the anime
    the weird thing is that it actually had some clever but writing but  plotting or desogn the way you see lisa eating the anti dragon sugar cubes in episode one the way the paramail riders outfits look like a technological imitation of the dragon priestess garb even down to the headdress and tail
  she did not switch sides ange did
        they werent in the character design pages of the cross ange design works book either they probably never intended to put them in at all even if the budget allowed for it
  are you telling me that cross ange characters not having nipples is canon
  thinking he has an opinion after 2 episodes
    fucked if i know     maybe embryo genetically engineered nippleless women because thats his fetish     probably not since the descendents of the inhabitants of the original earth dont have them either
  if you believe the special featurette on the sentai dvds fukuda was supposedly the producer who advocated ange to be a huge racist cunt like flay instead of the initial concept for her to be some lacusesque nice demure princess
  it was pretty good then the garbage self insert character show up ruining everything
  i could imagine detailed nudity was a dealbreaker for nana but its not like ive got any real facts to back that up
    thats yukarins character though    im not really sure if thats a thing there have been things that nana has been in that had full nudity im sure at least in the manga adaptations     she was in koi koi 7 that had fullon lesbian sex although not with her character
  so glad i requested this pic last year
    embryo talks about anges nipples being the colour of cherry blossoms because thats just the kind of god he is i guess after he finishes talking about her pale skin and ample breasts    they must just be invisible
  i just watched because fukuda is precurefag
  pointing gun  i hate when thats drawn that way theres sights on the damn thing use em
  come back to us when youre on episode 4 or 5    just decided to finish the show instead eh     i think overall its actually not terrible id rate it a 6 including a 1 bonus for choice of actors    its dumb thats fine i guess they way they handled things in the srw version of the scenario where you have to destroy embryos ability to use true arzenal to fuck with time makes a bit more sense than the way they present it in the show we have to kill his real body i guess he works on treehouse of horror vampire rules    the show has a big tone problem     someone compared it to madoka but i think this is a little different     madoka went show the real world  present the magic world to the protagonist  learn the rules of the magic world  learn the actual rules of the magic world    sure they both change early on but cross ange is just throwing in grimness wherever it feels like it your experience of events doest feel like its changing because youve discovered more of the world it feels like your experience is changing because the author just decided to do something different today it doesnt feel organic enough to actually be part of the story so it sticks out weirdly
    it has however given me a potentially useful reaction image so thats good
    you make a good point i guess
  personally i think this is the best screencap
i like cross ange     its terrible just awful     but something about it draws me in
  glad they got their happy end and everyone else got fucked over
  nah manafags didnt suffer enough an opening into the warp needed to occur with slaaneshi daemons converting everyone into eldritch sex lube while skarbrand destroys their homes fuck em hell i might actually commission someone to draw skarbrand and ein graze fucking mitsurugi up while a colony is being dropped
hopefully now that its had its obligatory handful of srw appearances itll disappear into obscurity where it belongs
  wow two wait thats not a handful
    i kept expecting ange to ask salashaska to make some guarantee about what would happen to the people of the new world as a condition of joining her but nah fuck em i guess    i guess theyre genetically forced to be racist shits and have to suffer before they can be good people so lets lock them in their mad max hellscape hope they dont become super technologically advanced and come looking for revenge in 200 years time     did hilda get a happy ending  all ange really said was she needed her in the her brave new world it made sense how hilda fell for ange but unlike hilda ange never really had time to even think about hilda much while they were separated for half the show
    he has very tiny hands    if they ever use it again i hope they either give people not named ange more than 23 attacks or make some of the units combo attack only apearences like the two dragon girls are for salsamanman
  cross ange is like if gundam seed started openly parodying itself they have the characters make fun of the plot in many of the episode previews
    is it canon that tusk survived a suicide bob by being a ninja
    srw cross ange x seed is some of the best stupid crossover fun in the series
    the show doesnt present any other explanation for it    i thought you died  nope
  you can feel the tone shift so hard it hits the wall the moment tusk shows up
  iirc thats the popular legend similar to it was an antiship beam so it didnt kill him since hes not a ship
    well thats just good sense
the early part is the dumb fun part when its like an edgy exploitation womens prison story where the characters bully each other and fuck each other and die horribly while being forced to fight monsters to protect the bastards that threw them in jail in the first place then they try to have a plot thats way too complicated for their own minds and just shit the bed and it has shitty romance and retarded twists all over theres a limit and a balance to being dumb fun this is a show that loses sight of that and gets too dumb to be fun
    i just like robots with pedals and dials and stuff
  the most boring mary sue to mary sue in a giant robot  ftfy  oh wait
  if ca is an excellent anime then so is fucking madoka
  no madoka magica was terrible
    lets not say something we cant take back
  the early part is the dumb fun part when its like an edgy exploitation womens prison story where the characters bully each other and fuck each other and die horribly while being forced to fight monsters to protect the bastards that threw them in jail in the first place  edgy grimdark is dumb fun  those words dont mean what they think you mean  then they try to have a plot thats way too complicated  you actually thought cross anges plot was complicated holy shit
    maybe it was too complicated for the writers not for the viewers
  why what do you recommend taking seriously instead
  no madoka magica was terrible  madoka wasnt good but it wasnt as bad as cross ange
damn just picked this shit up felt sad at first but if being labeled a norma gets you a crew of lesbians and a gundam sign me the fuck up
  while a colony is being dropped  nah thats showing too much mercy since it would be instant kill just have a bunch of villkiss looking like giant ange going around shooting the place up calling everyone pigs ect    would take way more than 200yrs to even start making technology again since they cant do shit without their mana  being with ange was good end for hilda guessing they bonded a lot while sharing a cell after their meetings
    id rather stick to watching precure might not have any upskirt panty shots or nipples but can be way better than the shit flying out of fukudas anus
anime never ever
  is that transformers kissplayers
  unfortunately no
  jinki wolf meca and rape manga  now i know jinki and rape is redundant but still
    robot games
  reminds me of the older valvrave whose second half had a plot thats way too complicated for their own minds and just shit the bed
  more like fukuda makes nana do lewd voices the anime
  you realize the drama is dead when youve got two characters die and then come back
  madoka magica was a fun rollercoaster that gets better with a second viewing the puella magi manga are just as mediocre as cross ange
    truly the hero we deserve
  that killed all the team ange related drama
  yeah but shes super hot and id marry her so its ok
i think i just like /m/ shows where singing is far more important than it really ought to be
  
watch this when airing  picked up at episode 1  shit posting sundays  bullying salia  all those mad a/z fags  this show cant get any more silly  teleports to fucking dragon land  oh my shit this is finally it  space hitler time wizard was actually behind it the whole time      this show will forever have a place in my memories
  forgetting the gag and bondage fags that got attracted to this
  look for some doujins of the show  only that one about vivian  all that other material just into nothing    biggest crime
  dealing with a couple of fetishfags was worth the pillar of salt that was the a/zfag meltdown
  a/z fags    for what its worth ive never seen such a die hard fan base attempt to justify a complete shitshow so hard at least most cross ange fans will admit it is kinda stupid but still really fun to watch and has good moments a/z tears were just fucking glorious every sunday
      a/z
  alnoah zero   the tldr of it is essentially this    s1  mars hates earth because they wont share food  mars has super advanced tech that can warp make interdemensional shit happen you can literally think of something and the machine will start to do it yet somehow they cant grow food because reasons  mars gets mad so the assasinate the princess on earth because that gives them a just cause for war even though theyve been blowing the shit out of earth constantly  however a really strong first episode or two  mars launches in full balls in without any question about it and goes about how yup she is dead its her being dead earth who had no reason to kill her killed her  mc basically is kinda clever and realizes you cant just shoot them like normal mechs and need to be clever  everyone just stands around shooting people and die the mc is like the one dude who is like oh we should like move when they shoot us  mc tells this to other people about this thing called evading and becomes hero  princess is not actually dead though keep in mind the whole reason for the ware is because mars thinks she is dead her being alive would end the war and show it was a plot by mars  earth keeps this a secret because the found super galaxy daigurren in a hill somewhere and this one ship can take on everything  mc meets with one of the head guys from the enemy who he has a chance to explain how this is a ploy now has evidence of it and can essentially get everyone against the person who set it up in one key battle the enemy even agrees to talk and start negotiations about some kind of getting to the bottom of it  mc says fuck you fag and shoots his robot because why the hell not  no one questions this even though there was an open com because mc can shoot   then they go to russia people 2 most important characters are shot int he head but do that are they really dead thing and roll to credits for s2
  s2  super galaxy daigurren somehow completely turned the tides because one battle ship against the martian army with a moon base fleetmega ships that have landed on earth already cant do things oh yeah they have a moon base now dont ask why  princess had basically a twin sister that comes to power because reasons and says they still need to go after earth and the real princess is in a tank alive but no one goes wait wasnt the war started because she died in a car bomb huh somethings not right here   mc also gets power ups because he kissed the princess and now has space germ aids and can make old tech work on his command  earth now can go into space and shoot the bad guys because why not even though this was never established anywhere in s1  space wind makes shots from the mc land because he has a talking robo eye  earth somehow manages to now fight back and start taking the offensive even though they were a dead horse in s1 and had basically rocks fighting so far future tech you cant imagine now its just whatever  princess wakes up asks wtf is going on evil main guy on the other side goes i can give you earth i am hero princess goes well yeah i already had that shit worked out why are we still fighting   error   mc now goes to moon base and beings wrecking shit since now martians all forgot how to use guns robots or anything useful  somehow transport ship of totally unknown high ranking prince out of fucking nowhere comes from mars on a slow as space taxi to the moon to call a cease fire even though he could have done this literally anywhere and at any time   mc meets bad guy he was fighting but because truce now he lets bad guy live so he can pay for crime and will not kill  mc then goes about life and the princess is like lets just like sell resources back and forth  mc then goes to cook some eggs because that is the only character trait he has and that we know about him is that he likes eggs
    can i offer you a nice egg in these trying times
  what was this even referencing
  most of those were urobutchifags likely  i like butcher but he got into this shit by himself and deserves every bit of poop he had thrown at him because of a/z
  dumb fun  how else would you describe video related
  fukudas selfinsert surviving his own suicide vest was fucking bullshitthe redhead should have won
  its time
  even the cripple wasnt a cripple  wtf is that asspull  although a wheelchair loli whipping a naked gagged monster musume is very original
    she deserved better than she got
  urobuchi only wrote the first three episodes of a/z its hardly his fault it turned into a pile of shit
  literally written just to suffer  following her plotline is basically a primer for the tonal mess the show had
    she got to be one of anges concubines in the end didnt she
  implicitly i guess in srw v ange says she loves both of them
    i was never quite sure it could have been    i want you  i need you  but there aint no way im even gonna love you        in x she treats it as a done deal that hilde is going to live with her in cafe ange once the war is wrapped up but shes a lot less receptive to her in general
  its starts dire but then it becomes weird fun
  the redhead should have won  the redhead tried to fuck him too the first time she got him alone shes just a thot
  hey help us save ange and ill fuck you  jokes on you id have done it for free oops
  a bunch of villkiss looking like giant ange  so end of evangelion
  
  while tusk will always be her main man i dont see why hilda cant get in on the action i doubt either ange or tusk would mind
    yes they have a cute anime maid cafe with ange as the boss its basically a slice of life series
    you also get anally examined so hard their robot arm comes off
  that was only because ange has the most powerful rectum in all the known universes
its a satire of anime in general the sports episode tusks death/rebirth the world isnt as you know it trope appears several times the cast is all female hodgepodge of traditional character archetypes the list goes on great satire though 10/10 anime is terrible
  its not bad its satire    thats not how it works anon
    
  this issue cover of omac
    thats what the manga adaptation should have been a slice of life cafe based manga without context that no one would understand until like three episodes before the end
salad is best girl
    theres not really any competition is there
  i dont see why hilda cant get in on the action  nana veto
  nana  not wanting yukarin in on the action
  hey what an adorable picture  and it features pitz  of course theres a catch boota is so lucky
  pitz  boota    you lost me
    i have no idea what you just said
  one of the pictures in /a/s drawbooru has ange being surrounded by mascots
  truly
embryo was as pathetic as his name last fight was basically being salty over how he got ntrd    also he was made to lose so badly i was cringing dude could have just teleported grabbed and thrown every fucking one off the ledge the instant he got injured he should not have been beaten under any circumstance
  embryo more like cuckedbryo    jokes aside im glad he got owned so hard his face was literally a magnet for fists
  dude looked like a fucking peacock
  no wonder why he looks like a beta even ange called him out on his hairstyle which is even more pathetic
    she was on the top tier of girls but she was only second best dragon
  was the best dragon named vivian by any chance    also imagine walking casually and sala jumps on you looking like this wyd
    i dont know die probably
  lmao guess ill die too then
    is that a quote from something that sounds familiar
so its bad as show too cause its bloody annoying in srw v
    i wonder if the second season was an elaborate trolling
  best part about the manga version was it adopts the plot verbatim minus all the blood shed and dark elements
    wait salia or salamemey    if salia best at what
  i ended up stealing this sorry anon couldnt resist
  the tone of the first part of the show is completely different from the rest of it
    the show never really gets out of the shadow of the early episodes
  shes the one who wanted a male love interest for ange in the first place a threesome wont work because hilda hates tusk
  season two fucking when
  the world building was actually decent the story squandered most of it though
  if salia best at what
    and despite all that winning shes still a loser so sad
  there you have it kids never take embryos side
  worth it
  tmw when you like the cleopatra but you hate embryo too
  dont make me turn this into a talking to yourself contest amigo
  please no its the worst series i ever watched  and the worst thing is i actually liked it when i watched the first episodes
  a threesome wont work because hilda hates tusk  thats what you think      please no maybe a full blown hentai ova i would be ok with that but no complete season two
  i think thats a callback to dendoh which fukuda also directed instead of talking about the next episode the two kids usually had a totally unrelated fight or made fun of it being really obvious that vega was hokutos mom
  who says season two wont be hentai
  i understood that reference   
  started to read it  cant say if its worser than cross ange or not  and are the villians perhaps muslims  and about  anime never ever  the series is only two years old who knows whats happen  im more sad that noone translates the manga anymore appearently
  lmao forgot scott mcneill voiced duo      pic related
  strongly agree
you know i actually liked embryos singing im not sure its the last thing id want to hear before the world ended but it sounded pretty good when he used it to blow up whats his nuts
  well its toshihiko seki himself singing so it isnt suprising    
    for some reason toshihiko seki is credited as char aznable in msg the origin so is shuichi ikeda and he was in origin when was he char
    uta e  uta e    people have been asking for a version of hikari no uta sung by seki since the show ended theres a version where embryo and tusk alternate vocals but sekis voice in that is different
  its a masterpiece dont anyone fool you if this was made with an actual animation budget itd be hailed as a top5 mecha of all time easily unfortunate that the animation is inconsistent as hell
  he voiced char as in the actual char aznable
  you probably are referring to the real char which was voiced by seki the one voiced by ikeda is casval
  they dont clearly you need to go back to anatomy 101
  theres a version where embryo and tusk alternate vocals but sekis voice in that is different    if its the one im thinking of i think it might be a pitch shifted version of the ange/salami duet version from i assume one of the soundtracks    ive never seen any other version i could be wrong       casval the invaderjpg    i sometimes forget that there was a real char aznable
this reminds that i need to finish this series
  not finishing it with /a/
i feel like the script really needed another editor or something there were a lot of potentially interesting ideas that were brought up and then never addressed again    why did the song use to end the world end up being so important to the dragon people was there some historical revisionism that lead to them thinking that the end of the world was a victory of theirs rather then being fucked over pic related its not just that salieri uses it to power her weapons they also apparently sing it to their children is it just a never forget type of thing doesnt their version have different lyrics and even if it was would you sing it as a lullaby to a tiny baby     and why was it passed down in the royal family of mitsurugi do they use it to open the portals and why do the dragons go through why dont they just not if aura runs out of dragonjuice does she die are they sacrificing themselves to prolong her life because they havent been able to figure out all go in at once    whats the deal with the sally/ange reincarnation montage was it symbolism because it was never plot relevent
  when you say salieri i think of this fella who happens to also be voiced by toshihiko seki
  why did the song use to end the world end up being so important to the dragon people  they were left behind in a dying world and had to go under a genetic change to be able to live there    and why was it passed down in the royal family of mitsurugi  its implied that the royal families those people around the table in some episodes are survivors from the old world that embryo brought with him to the new world it makes sense that they know about the song and pass them down to their children since it unlocks the weapons in the mechs the song isnt used just to open the portal but to muck with spacetime continuum when salamandinay sings the first time the words spacetime continuum cannon appear onscreen it looks like the song just unlocks the ability to do it    and why do the dragons go through why dont they just not  theyre trying to find aura only after they insert a spy lizardia is that they actually manage to find where aura is below that pillar before that they seemed to just attack randomly i think the technology isnt really 100 reliable because theres one time they open a portal right in the middle of enemy forces i believe when ange first comes back from old earth now why they do open the other portals near arzenal i have no idea    if aura runs out of dragonjuice does she die  yes they need to feed crystalized dragons to aura or mana will end they show the process once or twice    are they sacrificing themselves to prolong her life because they havent been able to figure out all go in at once  they didnt even know where aura was for most of the series    whats the deal with the sally/ange reincarnation montage was it symbolism because it was never plot relevent  fukuda series
  i think the technology isnt really 100 reliable because theres one time they open a portal right in the middle of enemy forces    i thought the implication was that they inturned to invade near aura but embryo fucked with them so that they ended up in the middle of nowhere in a trap
  now that you said it it makes sense for most of the show we are led to believe embryo cant deal with the portals opening but actually he wants them to open portals so he can capture the dragons and feed them to aura
    the fact that they didnt arrive near to their intended entry point surrounded by ragna mail kind of leads me to that conclusion    also he must have been the one who told the mana nations how to do it
pls sunrise make this suit canon its sooo good looking
  baka gaijin
narrative  shit saivour
bugu also
  when you want your gundam ugly as possible so you make its stomach look like the f91s creepy mouth
  enemy tries to stab saviour in the stomach  abdomen opens like a mouth and catches the blade   bites and chews until its gone
  its actually a prototype virsago  bravo stephanie penasy
  or the end
  but it already got in bft
i used to hate the gsaviours space mode because of the exposed upper arm and leg frame but it kind of grew on me after a while the models they use in the movie arent very good but seeing the design elsewhere it looks a lot better
canon enough to make it into build fighters if sentinel can be justified as canon that way then so can gsaviour
  my death only proves that i lived
     when your gunpla has a stand
  this id also like to think that the narrative gundam unarmored arm and thigh section is sort of a homage to gsaviors design
    ibo gundam waists likely were inspired by the gs and earlier corral from x
    or you know not because more than one person can have an idea in a vacuum especially when that idea is so general i know lets make the waist thin and when gsaviors waists arent that similar in the first place
  
  only thing sexy than gsaviours design is the g3 saviour
    is that actually supposed to be proving something
  that thing looks like an unfinished master grade kit
  those rollerblades  i am erect now
  buy mg narrative kit  its just the nu mgs internals
  if it has a toy its canon
  ibo waists are just a thing that washio does for almost all his mecha designs
  rollerblades    why am i laughing
  
  it is canon for now
  nearly two hundred years to finally gowhy dont we just put a robot in there
every other gundam series gets a manga retelling they need one for gsaviour
    would be awesome
  msrai is sexually arousing
      been considering making one myself but i have my own co/m/ic to work on too
so a question about gsavior aesthetics the fin backpack is a thing in f91 then seemingly phased out in victory era but returned in gsavior why
  no one knows why gsaviour era suits regressed but im guessing with the fall of the earth federation most ms tech got lost in the shuffle     your face when hasegawa makes the v gundam  gsaviour interim manga
did they ever explain how the space modes conventional thrusters can generate that much thrust anyone got the comparison chart
    ibo mechs were meant to have regular waists initially
    my own headcannon has all the tech were use to becoming so ubiquitous to the point of being mundane like the 360 cockpit being rendered virtually leaving us with the 3 screen set up as a redundancy  also a massive revolution in armor design and creation it seems like the stuff has a ridiculous threshold to beam weaponry when mark and jack are fighting on the colony mirror and mark finally gets the upper hand he has to beat on jack like the police from futurerama to put him down
  gsavior may have been a crap movie but the mech designs were pretty good anyone know who was in charge of the designs in the movie
  i think okawara has that credit
  okawara imo at his best
  so any other pros tried to make their own take on these designs
re/100 when
  is g3 or jsaviour the more advance suit
  if i remember correctly its the g3  i think the j is step below the g3
  saviour in gsaviour colours is pretty sexy
can we have engrish / funny texts thread
classic
  not engrish its a music reference
its not engrish but i love the fact that they actually got someone to write this down  loses points for the runon sentence though
  
  chickenshit skinhead octopus    thats not engrish hes just auditioning for a role in metal gear
    so that is what his tech support really thinks of him
  lol yeah i was watching blue gender last week and man cant the studio get someone who does know english to check this stuff i know the average viewer in japan probably wont notice but it kinda annoys me
  flap flap red char camille vidan will find tear of age
the tobacco shop next to the pizzeria in teyandee/pizza cats is consistently misspelled as tabacco the dub of this particular scene even pokes fun at it
  is this engrish though i could believe its just some new age hipster slogans to advertise a place called the scratch is there something im missing
    mimi  oppai  hah
also catty
hard on
  aids  here too elevator sign
  this is bait right
heero isnt human hes an adobe product
  iirc its an emergency warning from transformers victory havent watched it in 6 years though
what did they mean by this
  logh has some pretty good instances of this
    neat
  this one is pretty extreme although boverment
in celebration of gaogaigar getting into srw t lets have a ggg thread    also in celebration i put together the old gp release put into blurays  
  a thread to celebrate the only good brave im okay with this
  a thread to celebrate the only good brave  wow harsh    dont like might gaine
ggg final wasnt that bad
left or right
  both the cross combinations are the best i actually think it was a surprisingly cool and simple way to do an upgrade extra components would have made them look terrible like most of the upgraded braves
  right no contest
  people dont like final ive never heard anyone talk bad about it
describe this character
  manly
  fat  fucking  eyebrows
  avid golfer    great boss approves of all his employees
  it tried too hard to be dark and mature
  now in color
  the robots are absent from the ova until the very end  the somber ending retconning the original upbeat finale  the quality drop in the animation in the second half
  but mah goldion crusher
how do you think the ggg team must feel knowing they did absolutely nothing to stop the mass suicide of over 50 of the planet
  choryujin is miles ahead
  i almost came when genesic ggg combined i lvoed final the lesbian rape and swan masturbating fell a bit off tone though
lets hope clawshrimpy doesnt invade this thread with his autistic fuckery
name this duo
  people have slowly soured on final over the years which was somewhat inevitable when fifteen years ago it was held up as the best thing ever but also reflects people coming to realize that its really not a good sequel to the show in terms of tone or plotting its the big stupid shouty fight that people think super robots are but that gaogaigar in particular decidedly wasnt gaogaigar was about solving problems with teamwork and superscience and then there was the fight the times where it came down to brute force and yelling were the exceptions not the rule
  the palparepa fight was still pretty sweet though
    
not a fan of how final handled its darker tone or ditched a lot of the cast for a lot of the serious but fuck if that gaofighgar vs replica gaogaigar fight isnt great
ggg in hd  and mightgaine  and gun x sword  holy shit im in love
  faithful husband
  how about the jet poncho
  why gaogaigar is so blurry
  replimamoru piloting repliggg and yelling all the attack names and almost being equal to guy in a fight    literally the best moment in final genesic just didnt have the same impact for me since i was just tired from how badly it tried to make this cool and edgy
  its just an ggg sprite edited to look like genesic
  youre a good /m/an anon i was looking for a bluray quality version of ggg the other day and hadnt found one
what do you think about mikotos body of work
  i would need to examine it in more detail
i want to fuck swan
  its okay but it reuses parts from the zonuda fight and it lacks the emotion the latter has due to palparepa barely having a personality and a relationship with gai    also look at all that fire
  the lesbian rape and swan masturbating fell a bit off tone though  this though i fap to it many times i have mixed feelings about it
    call me a faggot but im superfucking pumped that hakaioh is finally getting a manga adaptation    even if it means that i have to track down and finally watch betterman
  bettermans not as good as ggg final but its certainly better than kiddyshit ggg tv series
  adaptation  oh so is that novel ive seen on amazonjp the same thing story wise cause i was wondering exactly what that was  also bettermans pretty good watched it about a week ago i had fun
  im hyped to the new mechs in action
  apparently the manga differs in some bits not 100 sure just going by what the translator says
    im still not sure how to feel about the new mechs design i like that it has some elements of king jder thrown in but the base form looks fucking stupid
    people have never like final as much as the tv series final just pushed the dark and edgy adult side to its extremes
watched it for the first time this march  two soc figures and nearly every kit now  mic soon baby
  now to wait for genesic and tenryujin miniplas
  genesis and gaofighgar soul of chogokins
  has the grand glorious gathering version of the ova ever been subbed i heard that got rid of a lot of the adult stuff to fit tv broadcasting standards as well as cleared up the connection to betterman
kinda weird to me that gaigar doesnt have rectangular limbs like most brave robots
tfw sakura never saw chief taiga again  they never got the happy ending they deserved
  how many brave mechs are aliens
the gaogaigar wiki is a magical place
  im sure she has a heavily eyebowed 10 year old to be mamorus sidekick
  the atlanta braves
run braves run
mfw gai is the one using goldion double hammer instead of mamoru
  really disappointing considering a human is more powerful than the g stones source
am i wrong for thinking teen mamoru looks cool
  the neuronoids all look stupid its part of their charm i cant wait to get a design for kakuseijin v2
      so this is the power of an evoluder
post yfw gai gets genesic through the power of courage back and finishes off hakaioh
frankly the main thing that bugs me about this new thing is that if mamoru and kaidou are getting their own mech then it shouldnt be another gaogaigar guy is always going to be the king of braves and even though i think it is possible to do a proper passingthetorch story for them it doesnt feel like hakaioh is going to be that and i dont think theyre interested in doing that anyway rather the new brave should be an original thing separate from gaogaigar
  hakaioh vs super evoluder god guy
  i geniunely thought he was guys dad and leo is guys grandpa when i first watched ggg
i suddenly had a brainwave while listening to the gates of magus thrudgelmir could have meant to have been named after a river or spring hvergelmir which is mentioned in the same verse of the poetic edda as odin    eikthyrnir the hart is called  that stands oer odins hall  and bits from lærads branches  from his horns fall  drops into hvergelmir  whence all waters rise    then while googling for a picture of the robot i discovered that its literally named after a giant þrúðgelmir the son of ymir
    we believe some day the heroes will return together with the oath sworn through courage
how does genesic look in great exkaiser colors
  i cant believe it took final to introduce female brave robots
  like a super robot chogokin repaint that you find for 80 off in amiamis sale section
  ggg is the only brave show ive watched but big cute robutts are always a great thing
name a better ani/m/al
  there was the maid bot serving oils
  pitz
za powahthirst
  she was cute
  right choryujin is one of my all time favourite mecha designs
    i love how volfogg was katsuyuki konishis debut role as a va
  still iffy about hunting that set down   one thing i wish for is some new soc ggg figures
  what is this
  so pretty good then right i think im the only person who likes the src mazinger in the hello kitty colours
pliers get toys before the sisters
  to be fair the pliers are adorable
  can someone reupload the brave design works artbook the old mega link doesnt work anymore
  
this is the ideal mecha body you may disagree with this statement all you want but this is what peak perfor/m/ance looks like
who else likes this god boi
  who the fuck needs lion heads on chest to look cool
    gfg is my absolute favorite design for any brave its too bad he wont be in srw t hopefully if they decide to reuse gaogaigar in the next game theyll bring final along too
  youre full of shit
  am i just not seeing him or did they forget his role as kiba in mazinkaiser skl
  while i like gfg a lot more than the other two it still looks off in a sense i guess i just prefer my brave designs to have the toyetic looking colors that they usually do needs more stark gundam white and chrome gold
  i sort of like it its like an mp gaogaigar
  nah i think he looks pretty hot and kinda like suzaku
  mfw the series didnt use mp ggg and called them generic gaogaigar
  i would have gone with the slightly more punish gaolaigar
  i downloaded this but all the episodes are just black screens with audio over them what went wrong
  strong enough to beat the replica ggg  strong enough to beat copy gstone before cheats  only out shined due to genesic
  only out shined due to genesic  its really not though reminder that the goldion crusher was originally configured for gfg to use and other than that genesic has i guess the bolting driver over gfg
  0/10  try harder next time
  some bitter faggots like clawswhoever cant shut up about how much it ruins tv show apperently  final is great it builts naturally from the direction tv was going in and in some way feels more distinctive and original than the actual show  there is fanservice which is not for everyone but its not like theyve turned ggg into ecchi or something  and people who have a problem with darker stuff should really just watch da garn
  it has galeoria road and a stronger hell and heaven i guess
  the only good brave
  can anyone reupload this to mega i dont have enough credits to archive dl it and the torrents dead
  you could always do the old fashioned way and save every picture
  very  very  loud  also  haaaaaiiiiiirrrrr
  implying it wasnt weaker than og ggg   implying guy didnt just do it with courage    but yeah gfg is cool do you think itll ever combine with any other robot like a standard brave
  no but guy gets the mk i gaofar in the current story
   i fucking loved those old microman toys
    genesic may be stronger but gfg will always have one of the coolest scenes in the whole series
reminder that final is not canon despite its appearances in srw which generally do their best to salvage that shitshow
  man his legs are long as hell
what do you guys think about the src line ggg model
still no might gaine subs  why live
  reminder that your headcanon should stay in your head      the src genesic is really good as an action figure but the proportions are innacurate as fuck the max gokin looks way better but is not as posable    soc when
  the volfogg from that line is a fun little toy really need to grab the gaofighgar at some point too
  i have one really fun but i wish it has more accessories althugh i guess you suppose to buy the src ggg and genesic ggg to have everything  the posable stealthgao is kind of a bizarre choice though
also the origins guntank is better than 0079 guntank
  i dont know the thing seemed so jank and could topple over with any wrong movements
    there is no way that the origin guntank topples before the original design it just wont happen because the origin design must have a lower center of gravity given thats its both shorter and seemingly has a wider base at least relative to its height and thus greater stability in general
basara looks so much better without his dumb glasses
he takes after his idol
nah i really his hippy glasses
  so in the end was he a better pilot than max
  shooting down enemy fighters max no question  doing a concert in hostile territory while evading various weapon fire basara has no equal
anybody watch getbackers    same look  same va
  shooting down enemy fighters max no question  basara could do it if he wanted to
  and he does all this piloting with a goddamn guitar  i fucking love basara
  yes its really good but the manga of getbackers is superior to the anime
but if he cant see how can he sing
  literally ryusei  nope
  didnt he get nervous during a situation and fucked up when he fired a missle
  he fired missiles twice if my memorys right first was on rays order to save rexs gang from an elgerzorene second was to try to stop grabil from killing mylene and gamlin not really out of panic but being pissed off that no one was listening to his singing imo the second time is the best part of mac7 cause its also when gamlin his strongest opposition finally does listen
  gamlin best boi also no opposition when basaras soul belongs to music
  yeah gamlin is great of course i didnt mean opposition in the triangle sense they arent rivals in love in anyones mind but mylenes more like i think gamlin was against sound force almost totally up until the episode before where they push back grabil the first time and then this one he actively intercepts the missile and tells basara to sing great stuff
  lets put his mouth up even higher thatll really set him off
  perfect
  oh yeah gamlin was definitely against sound force since he thought it was he most stupid way to fight an enemy and at first it didnt do much until they amped it up also basara kind of did get in the way of battle and hes still a civilian so there was also that
  didnt he also shoot it during the one time where gamlin and gigil were fighting and no one was listening and basara got frustrated and shot a missile and then proceeded to mash his robot fist into the opponent
  oh yep i think youre right and gigil fled with one leg busted that must have been the actual second shot then with saving rex as the first and intercepted by gamlin the third and last
  wrong
  hes supposed to be a better pilot than max currently is not as good as max was in his prime
i really dont know much artist that draw /m/ stuff on twitter or other places might kindly share

the the weak should fear the strong meme where the unicorn holds down the v2
a gm with a vfin thats it
    are you an actual artist or just someone looking to score art i feel like we dont really have much in the ways of dedicated actual artists
given the season requesting a toku style krampus and/or some evil reindeer mooks
  a scene like this where the og gundam is at the forefront with a colony sticking out of the ground like the ship in the background
oh i think i asked for this once but i would like to see a mashup of nu gundam and soundblaster from transformers because he was called new soundwave in the dub for the headmaster and nu is pronounced like new  im not very good at explaining so apologies for that
  no one wants to give away their art/ideas especially on 4chan where a thief is just waiting to run off with your creations looking at you hasbro
  not colored yet
  thats a very elegant penis good work anon
requesting a version of this with kamille as eric and judau as hannibal  
    i was thinking more like te pic i posted all somber and mystic but thanks anon ill cherish it can i have a bigger copy
  hello can somebody draw a gundam but in jojo part 8 style

i dont mind ps would like to see aldnoah in the style of gundam 00 movie parody poster with slaine as alejandro corner they did exactly the same thing by framing them responsible for the war
  huh not bad
so some new merchs up on the beyond website also theyre doing some broadcasts in december does this mean that za beyondo will air sooner than later like in spring or something or are they just hyping soshis birthday up   also what do you guys think about the present ships do you think anyone in them will die a dramatic death ex im worried about the safety of chizuru or fumihiko but im pretty sure theyll never die   besides that what about the dead people island will they come back in a vision or something and what about seris revival nothings been noted on that yet will the mir be communicated with and miwall be eaten   the only way i can imagine fafner ending is like either a soshi and kazuki being together again or b they pull a franxxx and have them both meet as reincarnated kids again but that would probably defeat the purpose of soshis exodus speeches then  thoughts
  i think reo is the most likely to die it looks like hell get some focus in beyond which should make up for being relatively unimportant in exodus im also really looking forward to finding out whats up with jonathan
  oh soushi2 keeps his last name i was almost hoping itd be something different so itd be easier to identify them
  itd be funny if kazuki was with both soshis and the baby soshi was like why are you talking to me like that when he was actually talking to og soshi
  i highly doubt kuruso is actually gonna assimilate miwa that niggas to corny to get anything done
  besides that what about the dead people island will they come back in a vision or something and what about seris revival    judging from the pvs weve gotten seri is definitely living amongst the deceased islanders whether it is a dream meant solely for her or there actually does exist some sort of afterlife for them created by their mir or some combination thereof
  seris revival  seri will hang out with the dead people while she sleeps  seri is actually happy and together with hiroto  seri gets revived and looses hiro again  this is the kind of kick in the dick fafner would do
  but seris happiness only has sights on tsubaki look a likes she nearly fucked up the whole purpose the goal in exodus for her
  thats cause she already lost hiro at that point she didnt want to lose her last remaining happiness at that point
  even before hiro died she did way more clinging to tsubaki and orihime than she did actually bonding with hiro she gets kinda obsessive with her its her thing to go great lengths she really doesnt need to for tsubaki clones
  im pretty sure hiroto was more into seri than vice versa and even then he was willing to dump her to travel the world with the nuns in the end
how many years did it actually take for reborn soushi to grow that big mimika still looked young while kenji and sakuras son was still a child so probably less than 10 years
  at this point ive given up on trying to guess like kenji soushi and miwa all make it look like its been several years but then ignoring the festum hybrids you have maya sui etc who look like they just changed hairstyles at most there could always be some fuckery with whatevers going on with soushi too if its literally a dream that might not even be the real him
  sui definitely looks older its just really subtle due to hirai designs
  yeah maybe i guess its just not as noticeable in comparison to something like suddenlyhot reo
how is the jinga series so far also garo thread since i cant find any
walk down the street to join the halloween party  
hopefully we can get the new jam project album today
  not that great at the moment well see what the introduction of the second knight does for it
  its good still early though second knight comes in next week
low budget and somewhat disappointing since hes not really jinga im sure there is going to be a twist at some point where he goes full ham and ryuga shows up with another new personality because they cant decide what kind of person he is and we find out its all an illusion created by messiah
  isnt this set like decades or even centuries after the ryuga shows it would be weird if he shows up
  it has to be set at least 20 years after the kami no kiba movie because of the whole reincarnation deal but we all know that if the want writers ryuga to kill jinga he will show up
  pretty solid start heres hoping it doesnt go downhill at the end like dragon blood
i dont get the people saying it will be all a dream/illusion thing what would have been the point of the false introduction then it would feel odd using that as a misleading cue
for those watching is it me or are they trying to make jingas series look like its in america
  its probably just you noticing just now that garo is filled with english text and very little japanese text is ever shown outside of handwriting despite everyone looking japanese and having japanese names but garo has always taken place in fictional locations with such characteristics the money shown is fictional too its made like that to give it a feeling of geographical ambiguity so as to help people believe more easily that these stories could be actually happening in these unknown places of the world
  the names are still as japanese as ever though its clearly japan if anything is deliberately ambiguous its the time period in which the series take place
  the names are japanese because all their actors are japanese so they cant do anything about that if they could they would use a multiracial cast but thats not possible no japanese place is mentioned they normally avoid showing japanese text in official media like signs tv news and newspapers unless the information is needed by the viewer and they dont want someone to speak it they dont have yen in the first series they shoot using yen bills but for the following productions they use custommade bills they avoid shooting at japaneselooking locations port city the stage of the first series is nowhere to be found in a japan map nor does it have a japanese name they do everything they can    there are multiple instances of the details ive written of but i leave a screenshot of one of the most noteworthy ones for me this is the map of port city that kaoru uses in episode 3 of the first series when shes working as a deliverywoman its shown just for a second and you can hardly make out any of the text but they went out of their way to use a national geographic london map and edit it into being called a port city map as to make the city seem less japanese you cant say they werent trying
anyone know if the theme of the guren no tsuki movie has been dumped
  no its still a thing heres the pv they uploaded like 1 month ago    
  its already out on tsdm if you have an account there
  as one of the few people who genuinely likes ryuga i hope he doesnt appear gods fang feels like a great farewell to his character and i really want this series to be its own thing
  ive always thought of the garo universe as a fantasy version of our world like what tolkiens world is to the middle ages
i like it but some eps are a bit slow paced for whats supposed to be a 13 ep series in total
  i dont see how the pacing of each single episode has to do with the total length of the series the important thing would what each episode does with regard to the overall plot    ep 0 backstory  ep 1 jinga obtains his horror host saving skill  ep 2 dealing with toumas memories being restored  ep 3 more focused in its motw story but flags the plot going places greatly at the end
ep 4 well now we dont have to wonder if alva is gonna turn into amiri since amiri is already there and feeding jinga horrors
  i guess its just not as serialized as people expected a 13 episode series to be
go watch the episode right now shit got lit        expecting a 13 episode series to be serialized
  i agree with you for me the story is going at a good pace every episode has new revelations and important events
  and google drive mirror  
  thanks anon
anyone rip the official subs for the first tv series
oh shit didnt expect jinga to go evil again that soon
jinga opening theme full version freaking whenmy word the opening is catchy as heck its remind me of original garo savior in the dark op
does someone have the webm of that swordfight
well that happened
  somebody already posted it in this thread
episode 04  right in the top 10 anime betrayals list i forget honestly but why would a blue butterfly trigger jinga into doing evil shit
holy shit the writers sure are crazy this time i mean it in a good way this series is really keeping me hooked every episode
  those butterflies are amiris familiars
why havent there been any garo characters in soul calibur yet
  because id be buying those soul calibur games immediately and we cant have that
  i dont think youre asking seriously but an obvious factor is that it would be too niche from a worldwide perspective
  they did an oc sister of a sgt frog character  theyre willing to get pretty obscure from an international perspective
  but garo is pretty niche even in japan  sgt keron was a huge sucess
    does this include the credits song from kami no kiba
  the credits song is an instrumental theme thats likely gonna be included on the series boxset like previous series
i waited weeks for this happening and im not disappointed our guys finally gonna save this trainwreck with no survivors
oh hey new knight  instantly get killed
  i suspect that every time he sees one of those butterflies original horrorified jinga pops back up
  soulcalibur 4 was the only sc with japanese guest characters though unless you count heihachi but hes namco anyway and they were all ocs done by famous artists and reusing movesets and custom character voices rather than actual crossover characters    note that the angol mois name is technically public domain although angol fear was designed to fit within keroros version of angol mois she was a separate character and owned by namco they were credited when she appeared in the keroro manga tying her directly into keroros story through public domain stuff was likely just yoshizaki mine liking crossover/shared universe/references
i was absent from these threads approximately after vanishing line ended i just saw that kami no kiba is released and the jinga show has started do i watch kami no kiba before watching the show
  6 has 2b now
  yes kami no kibas stinger is basically the beginning of jingas backstory though its only been mentioned in episode 0 of jinga
  isnt the answer obvious from the information you used in your own post
man jinga looking right at the camera after is great
  i believe   was talking about scs custom character builder
  no the camera was looking at him
another good episode as usual  but man the staff dont have much budget to work with for this series do they hope its successful enough for more to be done
wait what
  its still a possibility she could be doing this from the makai in which case shed need a body to incarnate into
  literally see amiri and hear her notalva voice in the episode
preview basically shows things being back to usual business for jinga  co  how is he going to explain to the watchdog and spear dude that this guy who was with them for an evening is dead
  back to usual business  are you sure
  since they were both alone supposedly hunting horrors it would be really easy for jinga to blame horrors for that guys death
  pretty much it and the more horrors amiri feeds jinga the og jinga personality gets more powerful    im thinking this all ties into how or why the dad turned into a horror
  were you using the script to watch this episode
whats the difference between dark knights and fallen knights
  i bet you could also see horror jinga miles away back from the preview of episode 3 and think nothing of the title too right
i havent read or watched anything from garo i dont even know what the franchise is about  can i watch kami no kiba jinga out of nothing or i should start somewhere else
  to my understanding dark knights are one of two kinds of fallen knights the other kind being knights possessed by horrors at the end of the day both kinds act in a similar way but a difference thats been pretty consistent so far is that dark knights summon death metal armors without a time limit to fight while possessed knights transform into their horror form the only time this was seemingly subverted was with knight in vanishing line given how when sword killed him a horror was shown leaving his body but one could think of that as a metaphor thing theres a possibility that the current series will subvert this rule of thumb again thus throwing it out the window
  dont start at this series what its doing with the protagonist will be completely lost on you if you havent seen the earlier stuff relating to him at least    if its really just inoues character that you want to watch garo for then watch the garo goldstorm sho tv series the gods fang movie and then this i think the earliest stuff in the franchise is the best stuff though personally and would recommend watching it from the beginning the mega links in the kamen rider generals should have the earlier stuff buried in there somewhere i think
  thank you for the info sir much appreciated
  
would be fun if rozan was the garo of this time period
  the only way that could happen is if garos sword somehow broke and was reforged into a spear  to be honest if they do have a garo show up itll either be old ryuga regular ryuga because this is all messiah shenanigans or dimension/time traveling kouga because of final episode makai tales implications and possibly him having to fight messiah again or theyre doing something crazy and setting up tomathe character to be the next garo for a future show
so jinga is actually eating the other horrors when he kills them and restore the human right
why does the moon shine    such a good scene i love all that kind of worldbuilding stuff in shows like this  also major props to masahiro he really nailed acting the difference between jinga and jinga
i noticed they say something that sounds like waiting for the savior in the dark in the full version of the jinga op not sure what else they say during the english part but its a pretty awesome throwback
  you shouldve used the shot where he runs a hand through his hair instead      jinga is a decent start point too this isnt gokaiger dammit
  wouldnt toma inherit his dads title or is that lost forever
  what im asking cause that screenshots displaying the wrong fonts anon
watch episode   fap to a saori hara title    rinse and repeat
  maybe ryuga really will show up in this later on
if garo dies in jinga i will totally fap to that
  you could just skip watching the episode and go straight for the porn you can barely make out her legs in it
its a makai ignore human problems and this causes innocent people to suffer and turn into horrors episode  oh look is literally the same episode over and over and over
  what a shallow viewpoint
  i think ryuga is unlikely but we probably will at least see the garo of jingas time since if his time getting hunted down by ryuga was any indication only a garo has the skill to put him down since i guess hes pretty close to the level of one
what if this jingas garo ends up being raiga by some spacetime continuum shenanigans
  that could happen if they want to hype raigas movie but we havent heard about that in a long time
ep 5 jinga was too hungry and ate the whole horror oopsie
  there were strong indications that they were shooting it some months ago various garo related staff uploading pictures in some locations even natsumi ishibashi mayuris actress uploaded a story to instagram where you could see a stuntuse crane in a forest im positive we can expect a trailer for the upcoming kinrou kansha sai
im expecting a nameless garo to show up in the original armor he fights jinga and eventually loses and is killed / eaten by jinga so shit hits the fan until goodboi jinga is revived as a result of eating garo and becomes a jingaro to fight his evil self so we can get double masahiro
thanks gustaf for doing the needful
  i wonder why it took a while for them to get started on that makai no hana was four years ago
the jinga swagger    since alva isnt saying anything about how jinga killed that other guy i guess we will see amiri eventually as she likely inhabits the ring
fusas actress is pretty cute  actually not sure where jingas story will go here which is pretty nice hes certainly different to the usual mc we get in this series
today on jinga a documentary on whores
daver liberty  reverse city  huh
  not just any whores theyre horror whores
  whorrors for short
is there a pastebin or good place to download the garo series i am missing a few and cant find any seeders
the scene with the thug and the chick in debt prehorror got pretty explicit though im guessing shes a jav actress or something anyway knowing this series    so does evil jinga only come out at night or something
  well duh thats kind of a horrors thing
  she is no jav actress  she is one of the rising stars who will be replacing one of the older idols in business
  there are a few specific movies and shit where seemingly the only seeded torrents are tvns batches on their site
im a fan of roku books with concept art for suits and monsters is there anything like that for garo
  toku
  the mega folder in /krg/s op has everything up until the last kougaera movie overtime is still seeding goldstorm  goldstorm movie as well as tougen flute 1080p so its only the bikuu movie thats in limbo at the moment
  they all do jav or gravure at least once
this garo series is low budget as fuck the horror transformations look cheap except for the first episodes its really sad because its the only thing missing good horror designs/fights
  even the cgd up scene with roze in the preview looked pretty wonky im otherwise enjoying the show but i really hope that the budget is just being saved for a kickass finale or something here
  yep and its unfortunate since the writing is pretty decent and masahiro is doing a great job as jinga
  budget fags like you are the worst
  implying garo wasnt always low budget
  save for makai tales it wasnt this badly budget
    thanks guys i was able to find everything i needed
i havent followed garo since yami o terasu mono has kouga ever shown up again yet
  makai tales finale with an implication that hed return in the future at some point but thats it
  bump in hope of answers
  theres this one which includes a short story called hagane no houkou roar of steel      translation      tvn also has some art book scans in their batch torrent for the original series just look for garobonuspics
  a small role in the final episode of makai tales
is there no magnet link for the episodes like some of the kr series does on anidex
anybody here interested in buying the two bluray collections for the first season of garo from kraken releasing i already have them but just bought a bundle to get the movies and anime sets shoot me an email and we can work something out if anybodys interested
  why is it in a hentai site
  as one of the few people who genuinely likes ryuga  people dont like ryuga  i remember everyone hated him at first because he was not kouga however ryuga has been great shines in the darkness and goldstorm have to be my favorite seasons and have the best other knights    its a shame will never see aguri again though
  there is absolutely no clear consensus on what parts of garo are liked or not i would say people are generally positive about kouga entries and that one anime is nothing but toilets but aside from that its a real mixed bag
    also the few threads we get on /a/ are generally very positive about the franchise then the shows never get mentioned again after theyre over
  i dont dislike ryuga but i do think that both his actor and rians actress unfortunately just dont have that much charisma i like the focus on teamwork that the two have but they dont really convincingly sell it in my opinion
  its a very handy browsable image hosting site that gives few fucks about japanese copyright
  everything about that horror was great i mean you could feel the despair i loved her voice too i dont know but i feel that i heard her somewhere before
why does masahiro inoue like to play villains  dark decade and now gods fang movie
  he likes to play smug and snarky assholes
why did he do it
  why not
was not feeling this episode the parental abandonment shit gave them a decent setup aswas the rape scene felt shoehorned in desu like yeah repeated betrayals  horror possessionspoiler i get it but it felt so cartoonishly edgy it sucked me out    the writing this seasons really good when it wants to be but its more interested in rushing past plotshit nothing leaves an impact plus fuusas got all the emotional range of a sleeping bag
    the real question is why doesnt alva care he did it
    shes been silent since jingas change maybe theres some towsidlike voodoo going on where she somehow doesnt recognize jinga as the knight he is and goes dormant or it could be the effects of the change maybe evil jingas an inga emp
金狼感謝祭2018 緊急生特番 jinga スペシャル    放送日程 11月23日金祝   時間 2000210060分 csファミリー劇場/ファミリー劇場club/ニコニコ生放送  出演井上正大 ほか
  it seems that jinga and jinga are two facets of the same body it could be that when jinga is on his power puts not only both jinga and alba to sleep or it could be ye olde memory manipulation
      at this point im willing to believe alva is amiri she could be going in and out of the ring like zaruba did in the the bible manga
    yeah fusas kind of reminding me of rian but worse as shes somehow even more bland    also piecing through kami no kiba a lot and holy fuck aguri and takeru are still bumble kings as always especially aguri    jinga series is pretty fun so far though liked the underground wrestler dude who seems like the same actor as boan    i also wonder if the ladies in labyrinth are all jav idols or something some of them seem familiar
  one of fusas problems is that she only has one tone for her voice and it is either loud or low she doesnt have any range we were supposed to feel how upset she was and her determination to save rika the horror but the performance was absolutely flat it stood up even more because rikas actress can actually act
    yeah she sounded pretty flat too in episode 2 where she had to confront her selfdoubt        i tried making jinga not long ago actually shit didnt go as well as i had wanted to since none of the upper body clothes options line up but i can try again maybe    as for armors nightmares new helm doesnt work as well as substitute garo helmets like it did in 4 or 5
fusas actresses isnt really bothering me but i think that might be because dragon bloods leading lady had an even more wooden actress fusa looks better by comparison i guess
best i could do
  the thing is that alice was flat and obnoxious so you at least felt something when she opened her mouth fusa is just flat and nothing she says has any substance
ep 6 i love the horror jinga suit so much
technically everyone saw this coming so im not sure it counts as a spoiler but
  really makes you think
  apparently kuriyama hates curry which cements ryuga as the worst garo imo
  trust no one not even yourself
  we literally saw amiri in episode 4
  inoue is directing episode 09
  pretty sure thats jinga
  man you can really see how low the budget is for jinga with how cheap that suit looks compared to other armors
  i made it for you
  still looks better than bronze armors
  jinga  chubby face  jinga  suddenly sculpted
  how hard is it to direct something while also acting in it
  not as hard as appearing in two places at once
    i know what the kleenex box is for but my mind went to masturbation jokes immediately anyways jav has ruined my mind
  kleenex is for blowing your load into after you get a big snot in your nose
  5994fps  they film in high framerate i see yet what we get is the same eye 23 fps cancer we always get broadcast tv needs to die its not fair that well never see the footage the way that it was meant to be
can kids be horrors too other than jingas brother i cant remember another kid being a horror before
i just not randomly visited overtimes web page and saw this jinga shit what is their problem why are the refusing to make a new main series garo
  why are the refusing to make a new main series garo  it had an anime season very recently for what its worth though i dont really see the issue with giving other characters their own spinoffs
  well anime garo is definitely different and would we really want it take over the toku garo does every that watches the toku watched the anime did they even air on the same tv/general timeslot range
  i dont watch the anime garo myself just saying that there was another anime garo recently as far as i can tell there is a new anime show every few years its not the death of the main series or anything also there is the raiga movie which i think is just having production issues or something but its there
  anyone can be a horror you dont even need to be a bad person
  garo kami no kiba literally came out january this year along with an anime season and an a movie that ties into the previous anime season theyre just pushing jinga since he was really popular he even got a stage show
  60fps tv shows are horrible  look at the early heisei riders
  first one is worth watching second one should burn in a fire third one is disappointing should only really watch episode 1 and the first fightscene between garo and knight
  kougas era is worth watching ryugas era should burn in a fire third one is disappointing  im sensing a pattern here
  what the fuck are you talking about 60fps looks like absolute shit even more when they have animation
    wasnt there a kitty horror in raigas series one time or during goldstorm
how far into a person memory can a makai priest delete what if a priest with malicious intent delete memories of the most basic skills from a person
wait since when do horrors keep their clothes on after fully transforming
  oh yes the shows that have never been released in 60fps doubling the frames in a 30fps video isnt the same as having a 60fps source you buffoon      and you are just scum you want to hold the human race back wed be wiping our arses with rocks if it were up to you well lucky you visual entertainment will be locked to a blurry slideshow for fucking ever
  he mad
  nigger
so jinga is literally soma cruz
  
episode 6 in a shellnut eat your brother jinga be the pedo i know you can be    so is touma actually liberated or was evil jingas spiel just a very awkward attempt to play on jingas fears cause as far as we know hes not a horror anymore    oh and fuusa continues to be irrelevant shocker    im not like that anymore    does jinga have his memories or not

  an ironic insult coming from a hut dwelling tribal primate who thinks cinematic 24fps is acceptable in currentyear
  brutal
  it is not i that is going to disappear it is the world  i have no idea why why they made that crappy 360 youtube commercial for a play
never watched garo before where should i start
  where should i start  at the start believe it or not
  the first series chapter of the black knight after that go in production order you may skip guren no tsuki all together
  why skip guren no tsuki
  because its infamously shit from animation to writing to plot to characters everything about it is just bad other than the music and even then it sounds like rejected and recycled music from the first anime series so it doesnt really fit    otherwise we do not speak about guren no tsuki
do ddls or well seeded torrents exist of overtime subs of any of the following properties im not finding any well seeded torrents of these or nyaa and cant find any ddls of them    the tougen flute  goldstorm movie  biku movie  ashura movie
  scratch that could someone seed any of the overtime biku torrents on nyaa its the only one that im getting no seeders on now
  you can get it off krdlmoe
ep 7 amiri stabbed jingas dad and turned him into a horror
mfw hopes and dreams crushed by jinga at the end of this episode      biku 1080 should be seeded or just use krdl i guess
so are we having an annual event with announcements tomorrow as usual or not this year
  yes 8pm jst tomorrow  
    cool thanksthat jinga special does not give me much hopes about raiga movie though
  yes      get    sansei
  i want you sansei
  1 2 三 四  love you mr sansei
  noted curryhater kuriyama sent her that apparently
doesnt seem like the japanese speakers of the thread are around so heres the relevant roughly googletranslateparsed list of what was announced today please correct anything if its wrong     raiga movie spring 2019   new garo series summer 2019 dont see anyone saying if its an anime or live action   the company making official madogu reproductions is making more madogu and a small exhibition of what they have so far not that anyone cares here   or that youd care about line stamps   or kels singing songs
  official site for the raiga movie is up not much to see beyond the date and credits for nakayama and amemiya 
  we got any news about the guren no tsuki movie
  wut usuzumizakura already premiered and left theaters anon unless you meant a home video release date i dont see a listing on amazon yet check amazon in january for the preorders
  thats what i meant yeah from there its a hop skip and a jump to someone subbing it hopefully    did we get any reports of how it was the hnk movie was pretty great
  oh yeah they dont use these events to announce home video releases
time for theories thread  神牙狼 2019  
    is there a vod of it
  what i guessed a few weeks ago 
  jinga ends on december    could be a movie though
  maybe jinga ends with a bad end jinga wins garo is dead hes now jingaro movie is a new garo rising up to try and stop him in a dystopian post apocalyptic future
  funi subbed the last movie right
  amemiya seems to really like the character a lot
so raiga movie is a go
garo vanishing line soundtrack got released a while back  finally get to listen to the first episodes fight song    beautiful
  yep spring or summer 2019 theres also a new garo series in the works
  sauce
  
i dont get why jinga even did that at the end of the latest episode
  he feeds on the despair from knights and priests to become stronger as told in jinga mezame
  thats a very specific tag
was it even legal to televise masahiros debut into javs
jinga is such a huge dick like wow
goddamn jinga is a lovable cunt      i hope the next animated series is set in a period between leon and swords
  took them a while though    everyone seems to unanimously hate guren no tsuki so youre gonna have to wait for funi most likely
  the divine flame movie was fansubbed within a couple of days from the japanese home release if the usuzumisakura movie is good i would count on it getting subbed fast enough
  dudes got a zetsuboner thatd put urobuchis to shame      ought to be an age gap tag as well since ryumes over a hundred or so
  man the whole vanishing line soundtrack is pretty fucking good shame i cant seem to find the song that plays during the fight on the bridge in the first episode
i am watching gods fang and while i havnt seen a lot of garo was anyone thinking the fuck when the dog started to bark bullets
    yeah the moviethe movies fuckin weird that whole thing felt like a hodgepodge of three entirely different films smushed together
  garo have a lot of weird things
  that was the best part of the movie and anyone who think otherwise need to chill out and have some fun
  giant makai brush cannon man    that shit was dope
so could someone clear this order up for me years ago this was the order i got   garo   byakuya no maju beast of the midnight sun   red requiem   kiba ankoku kishi gaiden dark knight apocrypha   makaisenki   soukoku no maryu lament of the dark dragon   yami o terasu mono the one who shines in the darkness   tougen no fue the tougen flute   zero black blood   makai no hana flower of makai   garo honoo no kokuin carved seal of flames    is there anything else to add to this list in terms of watch order i have no clue where jinga is and i dont know the name of the anime so im not sure if the last one is that or not
  the first anime is the last one and has nothing to do with the other shows its also got a pretty good movie garo guren no tsuki does not exist although its movie might garo vanishing line definitely exists
      if the movie wasnt trying its damndest to be dark and gritty up to that point id agree with both of you     that film had no idea what it wanted to be and just kinda spewed concepts onto the screen at random tone was all over the damn place    why have all the complex framing devices if mindless funs what youre going for also the reverse
  the animes are their own verse so theyre not connected to main canon you can watch them anytime seal of flames  sof divine flame  vanishing line guren no tsuki does not exist    ryugaverse starts from towsid and goes from there jinga is the current ryugaverse show watch that after the movie    the order for the kougaverse is fine though watch kiba gaiden right after season 1 red requiems events are irrelevant to it
  
jam project
  
  that fucking sansei cosplay  also best garo cosplay ever
  also best garo cosplay ever  youll have to be more specific
      thanks a bunch guys
  one is a sansei pachinko machine one is garo i think i was specific enough
08 subs when  we almost at the masa directed episode boiiis
the jinga thats up on anidex/nyaa is not ours fyi    its some industrious indonesian troll whos fishing for ad clicks / possibly cryptomining shit
how many episode is jinga again
man this priest sure wasnt raised right hes such a fanatic theyre usually more grounded and edgy      probably 12
  13 ends this month  
  i think his design and characteristic are kinda based on a pope but in black
episode 8 or the episode in which fuusa finally opens her goddamn mouth and tells jinga offsorta    a few steps in the right direction even with the obnoxious makeup horrors    i dont know what it is with this season and putting kids in peril its trying to be shocking but its just irritating at this point    kinda wish ugai did a little more but with all said it couldve been worse im just waiting on 9 curious what inouell bring to the table
you are approached to write a brand new armored trooper votoms anime but you cant cheat and just write an au it must be in the same universe we know and love what is your pitch    hard mode doesnt involve chirico
  i copy and paste blue knight berserga or commando vorct
show mostly depicts deaths as explosions shown from far away  it changes to mexican cartel tier gore for one episode    why
  to show you that war isnt all wine sips tactical discussion and staff banter the shock value and unexpected nature of the violence is the point of that scene
  to remember the audience that behind each one of those balls of fires that we generally see from afar there is brutal pain and real suffering it also gives weight to the responsibility of the leading characters and helps to demonstrate how the whole aspect of honor and respect between part in a war while commendable and important can be very hypocritical in lack of better word
  
funky town starts playing
  literal nightmare fuel i no longer trust my fellow humans
      most people most of the timemean well however most people arent aware how bad people can get
    this without turning the whole show into a pointless gorefest it reminds us what war is made of and especially what it means every time one of the millions of spaceships goes down in flames
      i remember early on one of the alliance guys saying something rather casually about 100 thousand dead like it was nothing
overrated animeme for fujos
the death of a man is a tragedy the death of millions is a statistic
    i dont get it
  yang dies  entire cast on both sides spends 2 episodes mourning  reinhard seething for the rest of the show  based
  there was a video of cartel members torturing a man with his hands cut iff and a skinned face lying down in the puddle of blood while funky town and sweet child of mine played on the background after some arguing and laughing one if the cartel members starts slicing his throat with a bixcutter while the man gurgles on his blood  the end  still not as hardcore as that video where a man and hus son are getting killed the nan is getting beheaded while his son watches and then the cartel members cut him open exposing his guts cut off his still beating heart and show it to him as his soul leaves his body
  true golden lion  
  wouldnt that still make each separate death making up all the millions tragedies then
  
  what kind of videos are you niggas watching
  as number of deaths from something rises the amount the tragic loss people feel over something falls dramatically
  thats just monday in mexico
  its funny because it is a casual affair for the captains though it does become important plot point during the last arc with the whole rebellion
  tuesday cleanup doesnt sound fun either
  if only kircheis were here
  the bits at the end of major battles where the narrator would be like this concluded the battle of planetblahblah the alliance suffered losses of 500000 and the empire lost 1000000 men the alliance would pull out from the planet by the end of the year due to food shortage and stuff always really drove home just how fucked and pointless the whole thing is
  that was what hooked me into logh i was watching the first episodes and it was a good enough series but then at the end of the battle of astate gave that ridiculous number of millions of people died and millions of ships were destroyed    and it wasnt a massive end of the war final conflict it was just a run of the mill battle between the alliance and empire up to that point the biggest conflicts i had ever seen in science fiction were the shadow war and the dominion war it blew my mind
  shock value like any show and movie that pretends death is meaningful but only when it is to prove a point then it goes back to being just a number in somebodys list
  why      so explosions and debris dont rip human bodies apart
  nukes are too good to waste on cartel dogs
youre my only hope /m/  i cant find the source for this beautiful mecha component  all roads lead to pinterest  what are yalls guesses on the source  what mecha did this come from
  isnt that part from kyrios missile attachment
its a scratch build shamblo  
  looks absolutely nothing like it other than the fact that it has hatches
  that was my first thought as well but i think its actually the shamblos reflector bit launcher from unicorn
  it looks similar but the shape is a little different  this one looks stouter not quite as long
  you found it and what a glorious build  geezus this dudes patience is an inspiration  gotta dig through his twitter and see what else he built
    beautiful  covered in greebles
  i had completely forgoten about so thats why i thought about kyrios but actually looking into i found this pic so its either another resin kit or the candy toy version
  nah scratch build see  about 140 in

man i cant get seed and destiny of my head    just imagine how nice it was back in the early 00s specially in japan all those countless people watching gundam with you lots of old fans and newcomers lots of new products lots of things to see and interact and it was lots of different people from the usual mostly women those times sure were different from nowadays that things are mostly boring and without many fanfare     look for this post for example use google translate and try to imagine yourself in that time and place what an amazing experience would it be        i feel that we will never get this boom or experience ever again even as adolescents you could watch seed and destiny by sharing some dvd and lent for that qt girl that also liked it too and even  date her with all her shitty tastes like kira x athrun     i watched seed and destiny 15 years after its boom and i really feel jealousy that i didnt watch this back in the day specially in japan to feel the vibe of those times not just an anime series but as a phenomenon    dont you ever felt this feeling that what you are watching would be something else in some place and time that will never be again
3/4 of the decade is seed shit with only 00 arriving near the end of the decade  the 2000s were a dark time for gundam
  its a good thing 00 showed up so we could forget about seed

had 90 tokens so i did all 3 step up rolls  got mostly recycle tickets and my guaranteed 3 mobile suit was lvl 1 high mobility gelgoog which i already owned  i just want those 2 zaku variants that i dont have yet like f2 r2 and ground high mobility
  he doesnt have a r2 and both levels of f2  ground high mobility is legit difficult to roll though
save up for the 10 roll  all i get is the desert zaku  everything else is claws bop missiles and heat hawks    tthanks
get the discounted 10roll on main  get a bunch of zeek suits including a lv 3 ep goog  big gaw transport delivery is a lv 1 goof custom  fuck am i going to do with all of these zeon suits that arent the efreet
space  absolutely garbage team as usual  give up  hop in ball and shoot the shit literally  never summon my suit for the rest of the game  we lose obviously  top individual score for the team  this is absolutely unacceptable how anyone can be so bad at this game and make it to a/b is beyond me fucking bamco needs to fix this
  i saw someone dicking around in a ball in a match that i won today i guessing that was you
  did your team win by 3000 points then yeah probably sick of being teamed up with shitters
  yeah that was it and i know how you feel when its just a landslide like that weve all been there
  as a rule of thumb i never play space unless its a custom match
  friendly reminder that ranks mean nothing
how common are desyncing issues during matches
  fairly common
  first spin gave me 2 gm command ground type  that already have no zogok
  2nd spin still no zogok but got the high mobility ground zaku and another gm command but space
  3rd spin gm gm command ground and space ground gm cold climate gm ground gundam wr  fa gundam
      very nice
      im so sorry    on the bright side even though the 2 pool is loaded with a ton of shit all of your 2 pulls were new except one thats something
the dreaded 2 wins daily
  lets see how many games itll take for me to turn to alcohol
  ground gundam  fa gundam  fuck you you got something nice
how strong is database link is it better than 5 ranged mod
  i like playing space cause its usually a easy win i dont know why but some people cant handle the 3d space
  ground gundam wr  fa gundam  goddammit i envy you anon
aaaa i hate double win days
  same here goes nothing
  i got lucky and got in a team with three yellow units and proceeded to steamroll the other team even with a striker lurking about i was one of them
i hate reds so god damned much how come they can never pull their own damned weight
lose all three bonus matches  decide to keep going to grind out two wins  next match is going incredibly well  try to respawn and screen goes black    guess im done
how many fucking times do i have to spam sortie together to get these inbreds to group up
  because if theyre anything like the ones i know theyre too busy pretending to be blues instead of doing their job bullying the yellows
  just go after the supports  when theyre surrounded by 4 gp orbiters
feels like im being carried by the efreets shotgun at times
desert map  literally have to pray your team cooperates and knows strats for this map because a single fuck up can ruin this shit because each side is fair and your teams score can be irreversible if nobody is working together  makes me cry when i have to play this map in rating    start of game someone doesnt head towards e thats a mission failed  climbing back up to e solo thats a mission failed  have point advantage and e on your side but your team decides to push thats a mission failed
this mobile suit is your friend he cripples your enemies and fights for your freedom do your part and remove all reds from the premises
  runs across the ring in a blur of red bouncing off the ropes
  i feel like all reds have some mirage colloid shit for blues only they can beeline in between two blues and the blues wont even bat an eye as they continue trying to hit enemy yellows
is the list on the website in order od rarity ie efreet kai is the rarest pull
  none im aware of only lottery distribution list    
  he cripples your enemies  reeeeeee
  desert map is either torture or curbstomp  no inbetween
pray for my boi one day papa pls
  shouldnt you be repairing your legs
alright lads banner change tonight place your bets im betting on something from zeon as the banner ms and the background addition will be the ground gm wr
tfw a kid in a shiny dom tropen dares you to take a shot at him in your yellow ms  you hit each time  get the fuck offa me childs play        my moneys on either 0080 banner or some obscure zaku and the heavy gundam
  gimme juaggu
  wwhat if they finally added the gm iii haha
  theres 4 ms left from 0080 alex kampfer gelgoog jaeger and rick dom ii
  fuck you i can still put you down
  your girlfriend is a retard gm cannon fucked her brains out
lose a game due to getting buttfucked by yellows  be the only guy to switch to a red  half the enemy is yellows  laugh as i get sweet revenge with my light armor    forget the exam menace who can stop the naked menace
  any blue but in my experience gm command is the best remedy
  shame the enemy team didnt think of that since they all used zeekshit
  likely nothing cool like pale rider
  actually i find la gm with a leveled bullpup can compete with most 200 cost blues pretty well
  using the bullpup over the beam rifle it has  shitter sighted
  right i enjoy actually doing damage and calling that little rinkidink beam spray gun a rifle is giving it far too much credit
  the gm las unique beam rifle is not the same as the beam spray gun dumbass it shits out damage and has a decent fire rate and low cooldown  makes it somewhat scary to face it even as a blue because youre gonna melt exposing yourself to that unit
  must suck not being able to aim
threadly reminder
    if he doesnt want to do 1900 a shot to supports thats his business    i for one want to see a 400 cost gm light armor with lv6 custom beam rifle
i wish i knew why i keep coming back to this game
  i play with a wired connection and the lag still fucks me up sometimes    cause of giant robots
        this little exchange reminded me of a match i had a few days ago  space  400 cost  pick gm sniper ii  two fa gundams and a psycho zaku on the enemy team  spent the whole match bullying the fas from afar  the irony was not lost on me
  ethernet is a meme    end point latency is supposed to be less of a factor than the netcode implementation proper     of course japan doesnt actually put thought into their netcode they just write for their domestic infrastructure and ignore that the rest of the world doesnt have it anywhere near as good as them
  cause of giant robots  a fair point at its core its a very fun game the community is wildly disappointing though
  the community  what community you mean the general here where everybody just shitposts
  honestly my biggest complaint is how long queues can take i spent more time looking for a match than in matches
  ethernet is a meme
  no im talking about all of the players who are seemingly braindead yet are still in the highest rank thanks to the shitty ranking system why are you trying to start shit    fortunately i dont really seem to have this issue i typically play after work at around 330pm mountain time
the banner is another dumb msm  fucking stop
  your gf join space isis newtypes are fucking her brain out
  i play with a wired connection and the lag still fucks me up sometimes  while that does happen once in a while your connection is still going to be a lot more stable than from using the ps4s terrible wireless card      might not be a perfect solution but using a wired connectionor at least a power line connection in my case definitely has given me a pretty sizable boost in up/download speed as well as a more stable connection in general
  wait fuck really what is it the msms are my favorites
  what suit is it
      um it hasnt even changed yet
  not wanting rape machine zock    get a load of dis guy
  you seem upset also complaining about brainlet players means missing out when youre up against a whole team of them    powered jim rushes you and the other sniper on the team by his lonesome  gets his shit completely rekd because blue  yellow    cherish those special stupid moments anon
  another gimmicky msm  i could live without them they have gimmicks that dont steer the meta away from bazooka and melee theyre just a flavor of the month like zogok give it a week before nobody is using it like hygogg and zgoke
  my favorite is when a red tries to jump 2 yellows only for them to chain stagger and counter tackle his ass into next week
what suits are you using for the ranked match event
zaku half cannon
  350 and impact site is a combo of 2 things i dont particularly enjoy probably either my trop or zaku tank
i pull an io  the enemy team is losing   gundam sneaks into our base to set up a bomb  kill the pilot with the rpg and take his gundam  kill two of his teammates  got out before his gundam blows up  kek
  a yellow with a gatling would be nice especially if it has the right amount of range to it
  your connection is still going to be a lot more stable than from using the ps4s terrible wireless card  that goes without saying hopefully
  honestly have no idea will probably use my zudah im not good enough with my hygogg or my gouf custom
  need you even ask
  im kinda in a similar boat i dont mind impact site as a map but the 350 cost limit opens up a lot of bullshit that said i dont really have a lot to use and my only 350 yellow is a goddamned coffin    guess im buying a guncannon
  i use yellow in something like 82 of my matches but im too wary of the combination of impact site and the exam menace to be 100 sold on running yellow for it
  ive had a lot of success with yellows on impact site though thats mostly at lower cost limits its just that i develop a severe case of tunnel vision with my 350 blue of choice and my only red in that range is the gouf custom
hahahaha holy shit its actually the juaggu thank you bandai now just give me a good spin
  wait what
  its the juaggu  and just the juaggu  i hate these pieces of shit quit drip feeding us suits god damn it
  dont know any other details since i just logged in but its 3 godamn stars so im sure ill never get one also psa xamel in recycle shop for 210 tickets
  does having a lower refresh rate tv or monitor help
  yeah i just saw it on the twitter    mffw
  unironically my 2nd favorite mobile suit behind the gogg and the only suit i took up to mastery 20 in msgo i hope its a 400 yellow
here comes the ugliest piece of shit does the dev team have a boner for shitty zeon aquatic ms but i diagress no new ms in the dp store but we got the xamel and lvl4 zaku 2s for 90 tickets we did however get the cold climate gm lvl3 and its machine gun in the gacha and new levels for the ground type bazooka the mmp78 with grenade launcher as well as heat hawk enhanced important to all is that the ranked/tournament matches will have started tommorow good luck
  juaggu  so more zeek trash
went through the site looks like juaggu is 350 yellow belly beam guns are the primary weapon and has finger barrage rockets as a secondary weapon
    got to sit through the garbage before they get to the shit worth your tokens
  no im never using my tokens again
  just go for single spins and thats that just try getting some good ms stay within a certain cost range win matches there and thats it
  fucking hell bamco are they taking the fucking piss
all these people shitting on the cutest elephant  i hope we get the agg next now amphibious ms are best ms
  oh fuck off ive had enough of shitty amphibious ms give us an aquatic map or stop adding them altogheter or at least add something else in the background
gameplay 520    
  don don don don don don don don     i want a juaggu so badly
did we get any balance changes
  aside from the changes last week doesnt look like it
  this is one of the most barebones banners ever one new unit a couple of new unit and weapon levels thats it nothing added to the dp store no background unit in gacha
  truly the worst update
  got a ground gundam and full armor in the same roll  fuck you bitch those are two of my most wanted units fuck you
  go after a yellowbellied coward  immediately the enemy team all begin advancing on your position  due to how stuns work the yellow just has to shoot you once for your retreat to be thwarted
  hit with a shell by a yellow  stunned  then with all of the blues rockets consecutively instead of all at once
i feel like they are just trying to fill in the marine typing cuz so far we got 25 reds 2 blues and 1 yellow so ima hope that means when they add another yellow marine they are gonna add some kind of water least i hope so or some big update they are just stalling for
  lets hope otherwise were likely going to get the kampfer and alex one of these coming weeks
  at this rate well never get the kampfer and alex
  add water maps  its just a bunch of zeon ms because they havent added anything feddie yet
  would be a nice contrast to the feddiefest of every other match today
next english translation when la  im tired of uc stuff
  then wait for next 2
  feds canonically had shitfuck in the oceans around the oyw sloeps and aqua gms need not apply
are the dualies worth using on this
  at least you can use zeon ms on ground or space matches youd be stuck with zeek shit for water maps with no choice for anything else
this shit is misleading as fuck i thought it was available on pc because the website doesnt specify  free to play  download here  pc download  takes you to psn web store
    a man can dream the only gundam game we get on pc is that shitty gundam breaker
  only        gundam online is on pc too i personally think its worse than gbo
  what is mobile suit gundam online
  tw server is dying in march dont remind me gonna miss artillery
  started playing it last month its fun despite being unbalanced as hell sad to hear this
  feddiefest all day erryday    maybe you should make better mobile suits instead of whining zeekscum
  1v1 me in the ocean fedshitter
take away the blinder  why
  because the panzer grenade is better in every possible way
  but then why not just pull a pezun dwadge and turn it into an actual beam gun
my motivation to play this game is at its absolute minimum  i am so tired of being put on shit teams that lose us the game by 2000 points
try out the suit ill be using for ranked in 350 rated  get top score assist and hit rate for the team  still lose  i hope the team i get in ranked is as good as i am better would be great
  thinking you have ocean to run to when youre still surrounded by sand
dom tropen sucks cock sadly never using this suit again
    i liked it and was using it before it was buffed you cant beat having two stuns and a mmp80 sub
  i thought it was fun to play after i learned how to drift around corners
  when you maneuver armor through bazooka stuns  when you realize that the bazooka and sturmfaust are for drifting different corners  when youre now doing almost 200 to raids with your mmp80
  never really understood the bazooka meta when the mmp80 always felt way more reliable to me  the grenade launcher is also a very big bonus
i bought a guncannon for the upcoming ranked match  but i suck with it i imagined i would have little problem with it since im so used to the gm sniper ii but thats not the case can i please have some tips and tricks
  you want to stun with the cannons then do a quick shot with the beam rifle
  stun with your shoulder cannons and follow up with your beam rifle its basically the same idea as stunning with the zook and following with melee you can play far away but i think mid range and somewhat close to your allys is best so you can support them and get help easier when an efreet kai tries to rush your ass im no expert by any means and my style of play may not work for you but the guncannon rewards mid range play the best i think
  let me set you straight friend though i warn you ive had a few tonight  always switch to your cannons when youre not in combat  if theres somecunt in the distance blast his ass  if that cunt is near you blast his feet  once hes stunned hit him with a beam  all there is to it i deactivate the vulcans because theyre useless unless youre literally out of ammo/recharging beam shot even then theyre marginally less uselss  good luck
  this guy knows positioning
      thank you all very much for the tips the one about disabling the vulcans was something i didnt actually knew i could do but it looks promising since one of my problems with it was that it has too many weapons to cycle through
  zooks dole out those staggers which lead to big melee damage the damage from the zook shells is just a bonus i dont blame you for using machine guns though my own aim is fucking terrible
  definitely for some suits all you need to do is switch between your primary weapon and melee i never use vulcans or any other sub weapon that is essentially useless thats why im usually the mvp fa tb
  new map antarctic base  has a frozen lake  no underwater area for toads to abuse
ranked  doesnt decrease on loss  neets get top slots because they have the most time    good job bamco
  wait ranked matches dont decrease your rank based on absence or loss well at least i wont my rank over a week of not playing
  lose my rank
  dumb wageslave
trying to feed kills to the ace  random teammate runs in and takes multiple kills  do people just not understand how ace matches work or are they actively being malicious
  the collective iq of this games playerbase is in the 60s
  just for the record you cant actually completely disable weapons you just remove them from your weapon wheel you can still get to them by cycling through your weapons
  what do you mean you can from the inventory you can disable secondary weapons
  you still lose rating if you lose as it still counts as a rating match ranked is strictly points you earn like exp
need a red on the team  someone locks into zudah  its ok its not like i wanted to win or anything
  you must play with shitty zudahs who dont bully the legs of distant yellows
  better yet play efreet kai or prototype gundam and bully everyone
reminder that if you play the ez8 gm command or zaku ii kai youre a scrub
  git gud
  scrub telling anyone to get good
  having just been on a team with two prototype gundams i can say that yeah they bully nearly everyone the ones i teamed with didnt bully people enough though so i got to perforate their scraps with my mp guncannon
  not managing to deal with scrub units  dude you need to get good the gm command was recently nerfed hp was decreased for all levels zaku 2 kai is mediocre ez8 just needs to be sniped whats so difficult
i dont want zudahs on my team
holy shit i had two perfect teams today then the rest ended up being completely garbage why are people so fucking braindead and not group up
  im jealous  cant remember the last time i had a team i didnt have to babysit
  i dunno why do people fuck their team over by disconnecting midmatch
  funniest shit happened in one match we had an enemy disconnect and we still lost because my team was braindead
  i was on the other side of a match like that lastnight felt great
ranked game  team gets absolutely shitrushed  down 3000 points within the first 30 seconds  match dcs  wew fuck you other team
had two horrible matches today one my team lost by 2000 points in the last minute the other my team was bullied throughout the whole match and we lost by 5000 points  i hate the 350 category
got the whole trio today  1 very competent team  1 semi competent team  1 team of literal spec ed kids
  oh god those are always fun i lost one match on an ally disconnect turned out that the guy who disconnected was one of the teams two yellows and the other yellow was busy getting violated by a prototype gundam to the point of complete demoralization
what kind of cock sucking faggot spams good work after losing by 6000 points i hate this games community so god damned much
kind of surprised the mass produced gelgoog is consistently used by higher ranked players than the gm command or ez8 its like everything is weak to beams and with proper skill you can do 2k to supports and 3k to raids
    i almost killed a ez8 with a gm command on my own without any help i think youre overexaggerating how deadly these units are
    i cannot believe my team had less than a 1000 points by the end while two chuckle fucks on my side spent most of the match trying to beam sabre each other this is why i hate ranked matches
zaku tank is not good every time one has been on my team weve lost
  almost  on my own  in a gm command   almost
how come the gm kai is so fucking good i ended up demolishing almost every match i got put into one with only a death or two my name with a lvl1 compared to a level 3/4 gm
  in 200 costs it has less health than the gm lvl 3 but it has higher stats in other areas and has a dodge roll skill that lets it escape from a stun or for iframes in 200 cost it and the lvl 1 zaku 2s are the best general suits
when part 2 of the tournament has an even better prize but its 350 resource satellite
  would love that good space map and ive already got all the suits i would use for that cost range
okay i already have a level 3 gm sniper custom for the 400 bracket so whats more important database link or gm sniper ii
  maybe if they made ranked not work towards whales and neets sure id be okay with it as it stands theres no point in even trying outside of getting the level 1 suit
well ranked decimated my a rating im now sitting in the middle of b on the up side i did get the zaku with the fancy helmet     i definitely didnt have my best games today but i consistently was top score and we would still lose pretty frustrating
if they really want ranked to not be a shit fest they really need to do some heavy rebalancing for the next time they do it    the big one id say is get rid of bazooka stun entirely and make it a lot harder to cause knockdown cause both of those as is are incredibly broken mechanics
  i climbed my way up to a for the first time while earning my stalhelm zaku i feel you about the frustration they had 2 exams and our team just kept spawning on a point they were grouped around staggered out we lost that game by 6000 points nothing you can do about those people
    battle junkies is more like it     the longer i play this game the more frustrated i get
brothers
  wow they all look like shit
i just started playing what mobile suit should i aim for first dont care if zeek or feddie as long as its good to play
everytime i consider spending some dosh in hopes of getting the latest suit i am reminded by some extreme game jank that this game does not deserve any of my money
  ranked match on crash site  team manages to funnel enemy into the path in front of point a  repeatedly state drop back so we can easily pick off and enemies that try and come out  teammates rush the ravine and get gangbanged by dudes taking advantage of the mountain sides  am extremely tempted to disconnect  i need a command that explicitly calls me teammates cunts
  gm command for 250350 rooms  gundam for 400500 rooms  gm light armor for 100200 rooms  thats the must haves everything else is up to personal preference you receive good stuff out of the gate
  largely what  said    i personally like the efreet and desert zaku but ive been gravitating more toward supporttype suits like the gm cannon as of late for now the only piece of advice i can reliably give is to give whatever you purchase with dp or tickets a whirl in free practice if you dont like it just exit the game the game only autosaves your progress when you win actual matches and when you roll the gacha
    thanks
  i need a command that explicitly calls me teammates cunts  i wish the only negative thing i could find was do you want to die and i have no idea how that translates to moonrunes but i spam it for shitter teams regardless
i started playing 20 minutes ago and got juaggu as my first suit did i do good
  yeah congrats you got a rare ms tells us how it plays
last minute of the match  up until that point team was sucking ass  3k point deficit  suddenly everyone stops sucking and working as a team  still lose because you cant make up 3k points in one minute
decimating enemy team and half double their score and theyre pushed back to their last point  base  as were sitting in middle throwing grenades at choke point see one guy head through the tunnel at spawn  probably planning to surprise bomb our base  go around to our base and meet him in tunnel  where do you think youre going buddy
  literally everyone who plays this game      gm command was carrying you there buddy its just as good as the ez8      i fucking wish but bazooka splash meta aint going nowhere
the power of support is so good too bad youre a goner if someone gets close because nobody else will ever help you
  one motherfucker did this at the fair in town he leaned back too far and rippen through that canvas ceiling above him i guess it fling him about a block away before he landed in somebodys yard    they still use the same machine but theres a huge duct tapped patch over one of those triangles in the ceiling
  in my time playing ive only ever had one person help me when i needed  no one wants to work as a team in this game everyone just want to be the next amuro or char
  too bad this is uc and not wing where grunt suits get thicc armor every time an ace is in them
i think im fucking done with this game i have not won a single match in the past two days the teams i keep getting paired with are the dumbest fucking elevens out of area eleven and i keep getting buttfucked by teams of ez8s and efreets because lolmeta     fuck this game im just gonna get a new ps3 and play the fuck out of some crossfire
  expecting to win in a low skill team game  its worse than ow and mobas you just hope you get blessed with a team that works together and knows what to do unless youre playing custom games
  everyone on the enemy team specifically wants me dead and i think its because of the juaggus appearence other than that its pretty fun
  i want you dead but do the juaggu proud
  one motherfucker did this at the fair in town he leaned back too far and rippen through that canvas ceiling above him i guess it fling him about a block away before he landed in somebodys yard  so did he earn a darwin award or did he somehow survive
clearly stab ez8 first using down melee  it ignores all damage and goes through with its fucking lunge   get stunned and lunged again because lolsplash    can this shit get nerfed already
two supports can really tear through these blue heavy team comps as long as theyre not tripping over each other
  thats lag the back swing doesnt have iframes its like when you counter but you still take 100 damage from the enemy
the curse of getting the garma zabi zaku in a few lottery rolls bandai gods are smiting me
asr zudah on team  lets guncannons blast us blues with impunity  i fucking detest shitters who soil this suits good name
  zudah doesnt have a good name
guncannon sitting at the top of map with exploits  our sniper wont counter snipe and lets them get away with everything  lose  yea just let them win for free  i guess i should exclusively play support so i can deny idiots from playing them
  efreet kais who would rather duel groups of blues than kill the yellow
  t the exact kind of shitter i speak of
  they will still play support and youll lose because theres no raids and generals on the front line
ranked is an ez8 shitstorm
    supports job isnt counter sniping its destroying gps you only counter snipe if you got nothing else to do
  ranked is worse than rating nothing but morons    enemy support has entire map range for coverage because theyre at the top of the map  only unit that can even hit them is our teams support raid and general cant even touch the suit  youre saying they should ignore it and let all of us melt and die
  ranked is worse than rating nothing but morons  agreed went from high a to almost in b despite either beating rivals or getting top of score board almost every game
  there is nowhere on crash site that that a support can go that a raid cant clear the gps around your allied raid so they can deal with them
  on one of the sniper hills near the first point on one side they can fly up to an even higher vantage point its only accessible by flying up to it the red will have shit ton of trouble even getting there  none of our general suits were paying attention to it nor was our yellow which could have dealt with it to actually give us time to breathe when were being bumrushed by the rest of the enemy teams units and if a red even tried to get near theyd be put down easily because its a lot of effort to even just get up there  just the fate of ranked and rating matches in general without being able to coordinate a team
minute into the game  losing by 4000  i am 5 seconds away from abandoning these shitters and uninstalling the game
  and its done good bye /gbo2g/
  its also a narrow line of sight and ive encountered it and seen a raid and gp take care of it what do you suppose your support would do trade shots with it its elevated and protected while your support has the shit task of shooting an elevated position which is frustrating for artillery types and not being protected from enemy ms while focusing on the enemy support
  thats likely because the rest of the enemies team were morons who allowed it  having units actually approach it means theyre technically up against the wall/hill as they try approach it so its very easy to corner suits that approach it by pushing them against the hill because theres a certain angle you can actually walk/boost up the hill otherwise you have to fly up
    airstrike it really a support trading shots with another support in that situation is a waste anyway if it was such a strong position then everybody would be doing it in ranked but playing a ranked matches you see that any position on those hills is isolated
  our support shouldnt counter snipe our raid should just walk around the whole map and hope to god nobody seems sees him so he doesnt get gangbanged to death immediately    fuck off
i love when enemy pilots abandon their low health mobile suit as if ill do them a favor and destroy it so they can take the outposts while waiting for it to respawn i always kill them plant a bomb in their suit then hop back into mine they either move on and get cucked out of their suit for a minute or they hop back in just to die in one hit and have to wait all over again never gets old
  see those gps mobbing your raid its your job to kill the gps so the raid can do his job to kill the support     what nets more damage and points trading shots with another support or destroying a gp and a half in that same time
  just air strike it  and what kill it every 3 minutes where it will die then 30 seconds later get back up on the same spot we are trying to get back a middle point because weve been pushed back and even in the opening minutes that position can fuck people up  its probably not super duper good but it works in ranked because ranked isnt exactly full of smart people and its random teams if people dont pay attention to it then it will decimate everyone  its the same shit as when theres a sniper camping on that destroyed ship near the bottom of the map all the players just ignore it and it gives the enemy a free win
  try attack the gps while you have a very bad position because you and your entire team are being sniped as well as pushed back by all the enemies gps and their raid  its not that fucking simple they have the advantage its like being on the desert map and the opponent has the hill except theres an even bigger hill with a sniper on it further away
  thats why you take out the gps so the raids can take out the sniper holding you all down so you can get into a better position if youre hoping the enemy will just lie down and let you win you might wanna switch to bob the builder on the ps1 to get your mecha game fix  not the guy you were replying to btw just a concerned player hoping you wind up on the other team instead
    you got other problems besides that sniper who is firing at maybe the maximum of their range if youre spawning from b trying to move to middle how is the support going to change that your support going to just stand in the open and delete them if youre being pushed back by just the gps and raids that one sniper being destroyed wont open the floodgates
  airstrikes dont hit jack shit
  i wonder if we were in the same game i was trying to take out a sniper up there but unfortunately i was in a blue zogok and had to hope someone better suited would get em instead they didnt i called in some airstrikes even but he would just move then hop back up so  doesnt work huge was of time and resources a suit that can attack from a dash though can boost up the incline just high enough to hit him and knock him down before sliding back down to the normal sniping ledge then you can jump up to the spot while hes getting up even if he stays and holds his ground just keep your cool and outmelee him though they usually run
  implying your team mates dont see the low health suit and kill it
  found the arank subspecies
lose a ranked match by 45 points because the wr ground gundam wanted to fight in close quarters in the last 30 seconds  i hate everyone who plays this game right now
  whatever you say shitter
just about done downloading this on my gfs ps4 what am i in for bros
have you seen this gelgoog high mobility type
  rage inducing incompetence from teammates and occasionally having a decent match when youre the ones doing the curbstomping
    and waiting dont forget all the waiting
  rank doesnt matter in this game
gelgoog has a fucking wide backswing that will miss that cant hit shit thats right in front of you unless youre facing away from the enemy  who thought this was a good idea  i literally can not follow up on my forward swings because they are guaranteed not to hit
  dont do it this game is trash   if there was a way to give my account to someone else id do it in a heartbeat
  heres an unpopular opinion no waypoint should have hiding spots for pilots that allow them to capture points without worry
  must suck not being able to gelgoog like the best of them to not know that feel of landing a br stun followed by melee combo
6 hours left are you guys in top 3 of your pool
  i am in top three in both of my pools friend
  top three in my pool all things considered
  what league and how many rp you earned
  
enemy team manages to plant the bomb with less than 2 minutes left  they all go into hiding  bomb detonates  we still have a tiny amount of points more than them  enemy team cant do anything because they are all stuck in their hidy hole with 15 seconds left
first round of hell is almost done how well did you do boys did you place
  its worse anon if you go out on foot to try shoot them with zook they can spam x to roll infinitely giving them constant i frames with like half a second of vulnerability game really is fucking bad when you think about all the wack stuff it has in it
  im at 3rd place in d rank am i gonna get the ecoas outfit when the whole thing ends
  its still a mystery on the particulars but i believe we only get prizes after the second part next weekend
  each rank league gets different rewards at different placements  example only first and second place of d rank league will receive a lvl 2 zaku fritz helmet and the rest wont get any mobile suit other than the lvl 1 they earned  rank cs first place get the lvl 2 and 3 and 2nd and 3rd get the lvl 2  the top 3 of every league will earn the ecoas normal suit though and every one will earn recycle tickets and dp for their placements with higher placements and higher leagues earning more
is there any way to give away my account i got plenty of ms pretty much 80 of what you can buy with pts_ but im honestly done with this game
  yeah its called give the psn you used
  from tb and post oyw
ended up in 2nd place with 7k 1st place is a neet with over 20k by now but im not complaining glad that the others in my group saw what a shitshow this ranking event is and decided to not even play everyone else has barely 3k just so they could have the zaku and then fuck off till the next banner
  just aim for top 2 or 3 depending on your league the 2nd half starts next week on the desert map so you still gotta keep yourself up high  feel bad for the poor dudes who have the 1st place no lifer in their league who has 100k points i played for maybe 12 hours this weekend and got around 24k
played about three matches got less than 300 rp and havent touched ranked anymore  350 points impact site is just too painful for me
i ended up having to learn how to play as a red unit this ranking event on the oh so rare occasion that nobody wanted to leave their ez8 hugboxes not really big on the gouf custom but it was fun bullying the enemy yellows
  its really not that bad you just cant play it like the efreet kai or proto gundam i feel like it plays as more of a harasser supporting your guys with a steady stream of gatling fire and then jump on the opportunities when you get them like a sniper unit alone on one of the sniper spots
  20k  neet    i got to 20k and im not a neet number 1 in my league has 80k im pretty much just fighting for second in mine
  my main complaint against the gouf custom is the lack of a dodge roll otherwise i like everything about him  i do wish his heat rod was easier to use tho
  the problem the gouf custom has is the same as a lot of reds that share the 350 pool that arent proto/kai lack of a dedicated stun to one cycle someone puts you at a bigger disadvantage because of counters they dont hit hard enough at range    the gouf custom has a high ranged mod but cant really do anything outside of his chain gun i dont know why they gave it a ranged modifier over a melee one when it has level 2 melee controller its a fun suit though
  gouf custom has a stun though its even a heavy stagger
stop bullying the juaggus
  i will go out of my way to bully every juaggu i see until i get mine godamnit id drop money on this shitty game for one if bamco wasnt so scared of gaijin dollars
  to be fair i have no real idea how to use the efreet kai since i dont have one and ive always kept my lv 2 prototype gundam mothballed since ive honestly never liked the whole zook melee meta pic related was probably my best outing with the goof despite the loss and thats mostly me just harassing the two guncannons and the proto gundam two of those deaths were from me walking into the mp guncannon dudes airstrikes      i do wish his heat rod was easier to use tho  yeah my biggest issue was trying to properly judge the distance for the heat rod in the heat of battle most of the time id end up whiffing the heat rod or id land a hit but am unable to capitalize on it due to the blues wanting my head
  is the lack of a dodge roll  honestly they should change it so all raid units have a dodge roll
new bread  
ahem
  you are missing  wine glass  fake pin
zeeks legit thinking this could put an end to the federation in no time
walking distended anus
would people be really that upset if hollywood made a new live action guyver and cast a female as the lead and mostly changed the most of the cast and setting but kept all the important lore stuff intact and gave it an r rating for gory fung fu on the levels of the 1991 riki oh    lets not kid ourselves lads who here honestly cares about sho fukamaji and his friends and the manga has been going on way to fucking long with the only end in sight is the death of the creator    guyver is a blatant devilman clone with a body horror kamen rider aesthetic at best    even the live action movies knew better that the alien robot fighting was the only good thing the manga had going for it    besides a female guyver sounds kind of hot to me
i feel like this was originally 2 threads but op is schizo and changed their mind  also yadda yadda guyver advocacy blah blah
titty smashers are indeed hot but sho and agito are cool dudes and i would rather see a midbudget japmade live action movie adapting the manga in the vein of shin kamen rider than a hollyweird abomination
implying that giving hollyjews the trashy guyver 2f rights wouldnt be an acceptable sacrifice in order to have a magnificent japanese liveaction tv series / movie by keita amemiya
  if they could they wouldve done it already
    if they got a hot chick to play guyver fem and made it all about monster fighting and violence i wouldnt complain
    lets be honest if hollywood made it it wouldnt be sho anymore anyway they already changed it once    i think there would be backlash against making a female the main character simply because the series is as long as it is and is steeped in all the old tropes dating back to 1985    but then that is how every franchise fanbase would be if they changed the main characters gender thats just how fans are    if they were planning it i would suggest just not calling it guyver and call it something else so when people look at it that can say at least  looks like the guyver but with a female main character and not have it be negative 100 of the time    its not like the guyver name is that recognizable to matter for marketing purposes
  they could but its like a 40 year old sci fi series and nobody cares anymore after the anime reboot failed
  guyver is a blatant devilman clone with a body horror kamen rider aesthetic at best  are you retarded
  exactly why are people so averse to a hollywood adaptation when japan doesnt give a crap about guyver enough to do their own
just give it to steve wang give him a modest budget of 50 mil and let him do the movie his way hes done miracles with far less and hes the face of guyver here in the west     the first guyver movie would have been awesome if it wasnt for the producers meddling to make their own tmnt and the second one would have bern more awesome if it had a bigger budget     also drive was an epic film
    the people you refer to are fans fans usually always hate unnecessary change fans are usually the most outspoken when something they like is being changed and social media tends to make a bigger deal out of small things    the general public probably would not care at all
    have you seen the alita trailers
  yes it looks good      fans can really overestimate their importance sometimes do people honestly believe all those  from the marvel movies came from the long time fans if fans had their way  normies and casuals get out the films wouldve flopped long ago
  yes it looks good    in what universe
    on the plus side we know hes still a fan of the series
im not caught up with the manga what happened after sho killed his dad
  of course fan bases are selfish as hell im not saying its right just that people would be upset if they rebooted the guyver that way or at all
    that was in volume 3    there are 32 volumes so far    so i am going to have to say  a lot
i would rather the series died with some dignity left than be raped like alita
guyver is a blatant devilman clone with a body horror kamen rider aesthetic at best    there is nothing devilman about guyver at alli would have said its more armored spiderman fights monsters im rather confused how you made that connection
  and the manga has been going on way to fucking long  as far as time goes youre right as far as the actual number of chapters goes its not that daunting the hiatuses are a shame though  guyver is a blatant devilman clone   the influences are overt but there are enough differences that calling it a clone is pretty disingenuous     i really hope it comes back and finishes in a decent way hopefully it will eventually find a wider audience too it surprises me that its not more popular even taking into account guyver advocacys suppression of scanlation
  women are lame as fuck and genderswapping things is always corny so yes
    id say kamen rider amazon
  i attribute it to the change in audience preferences    its not very modern at all which is a fault of itself lasting so long it steeped in all the old tropes of 1980s anime it just feels old and it cant really be rebooted with a more modern take until the damn thing finishes    i mean the one thing it has going for it is that it has monstesr that sometimes get sliced up but it isnt overly gory like some might expect it to be  especially after the 89 oav series
  it just seems to me like it has a lot of what typical seinen manga dweebs or manga fans in general like the whole technorganic/armor suit thing is very much of the 80s but the designs and violence and momentum of the story in general feel contemporary enough to me     the lack of popularity had me thinking that its a series with a cool concept but lacking execution but when i actually read through it for the first time this year i found its actually a pretty focused and very solid story theres still plenty of room for it to crash and burn and i dont like everything in it but it was certainly a pleasant surprise
    i think its just more theres not really as clear cut a section to adapt like you can point to almost any story arc in berserk and say okay that and the only explanation you need is a fucked up guy in a fucked up world but with guyver while theres a lot of material youre basically just stuck with an origin and then however much you can get away with
  i love guyver but come the fuck on with that teenager discovers a secret society of monsters preying on first his friends and social circles then eventually the world and he fights them using a connection to one of the the strongest monsters which now works with him it focuses on existentialism and about how the monster in the protagonists body is corrupting him from the inside this is also applicable to parasyte which btw i also love     the only thing its really missing is a ryo standin
  i think its just more theres not really as clear cut a section to adapt  that much is certainly true anime adaptations go a long way toward maintaining and creating interest
    i really wish someone would get official scans of guyver going
    yeah i love guyver too but ill admit the first chapters are pretty devilmany however after chronos takes over the world i think it really takes on a lot more of its own identity both in terms of the guyver suit designs the plot and the overall setting
  are you
    thats such a large stretch of utmost plot basics some of which that are not even correct    thats like saying all giant robot shows are clones of mazinger z    there is nothing wrong with taking some inspiration but the guyver unit is not a corrupting him at all it does not have a personality/ego and chronos are nothing like the demons from devilman    the only things they have in common are the basics starting points of teenage boy gets powers and fights large creatures and basically almost all toku series and a ton of other anime also start with the same trope    its the differences from the standard trope that makes guyver interesting it can just be a little hard to get into the lore and established back story since it starts off so generic    but it certainly is not a devilman clone in the slightest
    female guyer is actually quite popular among the fans from what i know  so if the life action decide to use female guyer as the protagonist and heroine i dont think the fans would actually mind just not replace sho s story completely but instead do an original story but with elements from the manga of a girl or women become the guyver like how the previous two film did
      /m/ what would the story be like if you get to direct the new hollywood live action or anime of the guyver filmwith female guyver valkyria as protagonist   make it as erotic/romantic action packed  horror and as possible
  archnafel chronos founder shows up throws gyot into a volcano he gets better  chronos takes over the world  sho gets a guyver upgrade addon agito keeps stealing it until sho says fuckoff get your own so he does  chonos makes their own guyver unit is promptly stolen by liskers sister  and plenty more
  p1  starts off simliar in the manga with a cronos scientist stealing the units and highjacking a truck and blowing himself up later  meanwhile two teenage girls have been kidnapped and taken to the woods by gang to be raped or beaten and killed while naked  one girl dies and the other girl tries to get way but fails  gets kicked to the ground and hits her head on the unit like in the first live action movie and starts infecting her  falls in deep part of a lake  guyver emerges from the lake  guys try attacking guyver but they get slaughtered  girl is shocked by the killing she did and the gross armour shes trapped in and freaks out  guyver goes back inside her body through the back of her neck and faints  years later girl is now married mother and works a regular office job in la or somewhere on the west coast  girl has no memory of what really happened because of the trauma and thinks the gross things on neck are scars from a bear or something clawing her  cronos finally is able to tack the guyver units location to her  kid discovers one of his teachers is a zoainoid but is kidnapped by them  they call the girl and tell her they know that she has the unit and her son will die if she doesnt give it to them at her sons school at night  she doesnt know what they are talking about but she takes a gun and shows up at the school  starts demanding the unit or theyll kill her kid  she shoots the agent holding her son in the head  turns into zoanoid and smacks the gun out of her hand  shes scared shitless and begs for her son  zoanoid cuts open her belly for not telling them where the guyver is  as her life flashes before her eyes she remembers the locked away memory and screams out guyver with her last breath  suit activates and pops out of her neck and shit  scene is similar to where the guyver breaks the guys arms  starts slaughtering the rest of them with her blades and head beam
  after she kills the zoanoids she tries conforting her son telling him that its okay the shes his mom and wont hurt him  son isnt buying it and aims gun at her  she starts freaking out and gets out of the suit  stars throwing up and passes out since she isnt used to using the suit    wakes up in hospital with kid by her bedsite  hot asian woman with the body of an athlete and dresses like the terminator stands before her  reveals herself as guyver 3 and explains all the zoanoid and guyver stuff to her  they leave the hospital but cronus catches them and a cool car chase ensues  guyver 3 activates her unit and does super gory kung fu on them  they drive off to a cabin in the desert where guyver 3 trains guyver 1 how to fight  after her training they head to cronos hq and trash the place t2 jugment day style but with rubber monsters and gory kung fu all over the place  reach the guyot played by   arnold schwarzenegger because why not  valkyria shows up as guyver 2 and the 3 start fighting with difficulty  the fight ends up destroying the building around them and only the two guyvers make it out alive  post credits scene cuts to the japan branch where they reveal hyper zoanoid team 5  the end
    valkyria as protagonist   make it as erotic/romantic action packed  horror and as possible    valkyria is so dame hot  i really likes her she would make a good protagonist in an erotic/action/horror guyver film  a badass and hot female protagonist is very likable and attractive
      imagine manga valkyria went through this process too like her anime counterparts
    these are great but i think it would be even better if valkyria is the protagonist and involving in the erotic action
  make valkyria had a baby daughter in secret who she thought was dead but later find out is alive she try to reunite with her but the kid is rebellious because she thought her mother abandoned her   a young mother slowly getting better and build up relationship with her daughter would make a great drama  the horror part would be all the   zoainoids try to attack her and her family and innocent bystander  action part would be all the cool fighting sense  erotic/romance part would be all the steamy sex scene   valkyria had with her ex loverthe father of her child after they get back together and in flashback  also some sense of evil zoainoids try but fail  to sexually assault valkyria when she took off her guyver unit which already had erotic element in it because shes the only one who get naked when took off the armor
    how much of that do you think goes inside her
  valkyria had a baby daughter  pregnant valkyria seems like a hot idea
    do you think if a guyver had a baby it would come out all guyver babyy
have some art i did a while back
  do you think if a guyver had a baby it would come out all guyver baby    technically speaking yes i think valkyria could have a guyver baby like many science fiction had showedsuch as the fly and kamen rider shin   the baby would likely even had stronger and more complete guyver unit than her/his mother  a nature born guyver user
  the part where chronos takes over the world was eerily similar to the demons great scale attack in devilman
can she get eaten alive by the suit in the part of max tension of the movie when everything looks dire and hopeless for the good guys
  look at that body  of these two female fighters  whos going to be a better mother for her baby  which baby is going to have more nutritious milk to drink from their mother and better take care of 
  valkyria because she has more than a year left to live
    i think that could be a plot point in the manga sooner or later since sho fucked mizuki before she got kidnapped
  w e w
  i dont get it  how is guyver mecha
    power armor clause subsection aliens
  why is that a reason her baby is going to have more nutritious and abundant milk to drink 
      since valkyria is a fugitive on the run she would have to carrying her baby all by herself  almost all the place she goes and take care of the baby by herself  because of her prideful and aggressive warrior personality  shes likely be the kind of   mother whos very strict with her child wishing to raise her /him become an elite in the future farther proving she herself and her child is better than her step brother and her stepfather  but at the same time when shes strict  she also loves her baby a lot because her too was also grown up in an environment of single mother and child when shes a kid  in terms of nutrition and food  valkyria is likely going to be   insist on using her own breast milk to feed her babyto prove once again that shes best  her own milk is better and best fit for her baby  because of her imperfect guyver unit there will be many times when she has to feed or cuddle her baby completely naked in all her glory in the woods or swim washing herself with her baby naked in the lake in the forest  because of her naked form and her beauty the reporters/media/urban legend would mistake her as a forest / lake nymph
  you will never be megasmashed by those titties
  because of her imperfect guyver unit there will be many times when she has to feed or cuddle her baby completely naked in all her glory in the woods or swim washing herself with her baby naked in the lake in the forest  because of her naked form and her beauty the reporters/media/urban legend would mistake her as a forest / lake nymph    this would make great fanservice  who wouldnt want to see valkyria cuddle and feed her baby completely naked in the wood
  if it would fit in a banpresto game its /m/
bioboosted ass  mmmm
    make one where valkyrie is the one who gets pregnant and have kids please 
  no
  they already changed it once  twice  the one where mark hamill isnt the guyver and the one where solid snake is
    i bet hammil still had more fun on guyver than he did on the new star wars
  i dunno he was barely in guyver iirc two or three extremely short scenes
    he was barely in star wars
  this would just stir controversy like overwatch
would narrative be much more acceptable if jona lead a team of mass production nu gundams in operationphenex hunt
  while thatd be fucking awesome the jestas are more than able and no need to refit them or anything
  sunrise hire this man holy shit
  only if mp sazabis are involved
  i mean it seems it doesnt even have a cameo missed opportunity right there
itd actually be really cool if they created a mass production unicorn and had a squad of them as the main party itd also fit with the theme of all uc gundams ending up with a mass production version just have them lay off the psycho frame on it
  funny you should say that
  dude im at work i cant be jizzing my pants
  though not so much on the psychoframe part
  holy fuck anon youre a god among men fucking imagine that testbed prototype nu alongside mp nus
  99 sure the perspective on that right arm is off
  regz custom should be there as well
wont fielding mp nt suits be bad against the phenex
  thats the beautiful thing about the mp nu though it doesnt have to be an nt suit it can be equipped with incoms for pseudo nt attacks imagine six of those deploying special incom doing the barrier shit the narratives ma thing did
  i could see those wired ff and claws being add ons the engineers slapped together to help capture the phenex
  yeah incoms would work
  if jona lead a team of mass production nu gundams  this just got on my list of things to commission right behind if dakar got defended by neros and bargms
  what about gmbrabis
then they encountered the sinanju stein mk ii which is just the sinanju refurbished back to federation specs it was being stored and repaired at the layzner yard on von braun by kou uraki
  dont forget the hihambrabis and stark hizacks
  gmbltheys    and theyre all piloted by former titans
  wouldnt happen to have a gmessala would you
  so the jesta
  cant seem to find any which is weird as the messala would be a prime candidate for an mp version i found the messala hazel which is technically a gm
  hazel messala  aoz meets scirocco  now this is some high quality incest
  222  indeed imagine all the mold breaking stuff that would have happened if scriocco joined the ttt well before he started snatching up girls leading to two uber ma duking out with eachother
  but then there would be a risk that phenex may be destroyed the story would have ended sooner than expected
  the jesta was developed from the jegan and designed to work with the unicorn i think he means an mp suit developed directly from the unicorn
was the hizack ever turned into a gmlike ms
  god damn that is ugly
  no it wouldnt given how uber the phenex is and the aforementioned barrier incom units the mp nus could be equipped with if anything it could get captured quicker    of course for story purposes jona would still probably fuck up the mission and let it go
    theos subarms system combined with aoz interchangeable platform systems  theo and woundwart having a baby  do it japan
  aoz already has subarms everywhere and variants of half the ms he was involved in
  are they skimping out on armor materials by adding holes on mp nu
what if guntank xamel gm apsalus
  those are thrusters anon speed is armor
  holes  verniers  the nu is fast but extra verniers add more manoeuvrability
  it was revealed that the other fed pilot was a student of amuro back in cheyenne mountain thus why he was responsible to capture the unicron units because hes the white unicorn legacy
  thatd be a cool plot actually sort of like how kamille is called chars student
  itd be acceptable if we got the cameo of captain beecha and elle piloting an mp nu that unicorn denied us
we never got a uc war where every ms is a gundam even the neo neo neo neo neo neo zeon ones  also everyone is a newtype and uses funnels and battleships have replaced by mobile armors holding and launching gundams  get on it tomino
  too bad itll never happen   bb opens hatches and hundreds of funnels shoot out to act as point defense/or even incoms to double as pds  actual battle lines ma are bombers   transforming bb that turns int oa gundam
last few years ive run a marathon of stuff for christmas eve i expect to do the same this year    if youve got other stuff that includes christmas beyond whats on the playlist from last year please let me know looks like kr exaid had some christmas stuff at least     heres what last years list was    the teyandee christmas episode  harlock ssx 10  kamen rider 39  keroro 294  patlabor 10  patlabor 11  cyborg 009 11  daiguard 13  sdfm 35  ultraman max 26  neoranga 35 36  gobusters 43 44  fighbird 44  doraemon 2015 xmas episode  kyoryuger 42  keroro 39a  exceedraft 43  big o 11  endless waltz 1 dub  endless waltz 2  endless waltz 3  keroro 192  shaider 39  kakuranger 45  kr v3 45  ganbaruger 39  keroro 90  grendizer 12  0080 1 sub hd  0080 2  brave beats 10  0080 3  0080 4  astroboy 91  0080 5  0080 6  mazinger 56  keroro 243  exkaiser 44
  shaider 39  based
this year i was gonna also put in ultraman ace 38    didnt kyuranger do a christmas episode
  every season since abaranger has had a christmas episode
  why yes yes it did
nadesico and vandread had christmas eps
      any chance yall have episode numbers for those  thanks
  ep 43 for kyuranger pretty significant plot episode too which is fun
  cool thanks  i suppose checking the episode lists for the ones near dec25 would make sense  im probably going to pull some short bits from some christmas live hero shows to use as the 35 minutes between episodes of stuff in addition to commercials and youtube debris like soandso robotics labs season greeting    off the top of my head i think might gaine has christmas in it for a minute or so before they start wrapping up the series so ill probably skip that like i usually dont bother with nuku nuku ova 1
kyu43  oh okay this is one of those its christmas for a minute and a half ones rather than a tree monster is eating all the presents so the gang dresses like santas and it snows while the robot fights episodes    i think i might just pull clips of the christmas part on some of these
when is this happening christmas eveish
  apparently i cant read reading is hard
  yeah thats the theory  judging from past years probably starting sometime the evening of the 23 and wrapping up after midnight christmas morning  as i firm up the playlist ill have a better idea of the exacts
  looking forward to it i enjoyed last years though i didnt watch all of it
  nadesico episode 13
  go crazy        inb4 wikia
  cool that ones on youtube so that makes things a lot easier
  /ssg/ still has that mega with a bunch of eps uploaded right
where is this stream going to be located not sure yet if ill actually be able to tune in but ill mark it down
  cytube probably the channel in the op picture mog2    and splitting hairs but its a synchtube not a stream  so the way it works is rather than a stream which has video signal from my endvideo streaming siteyou  its a more decentralized thing  when you go there it tells your browser go to youtube video xx and set it to 0102 then two seconds later make sure youre at 0104 then when it finishes it tells the browser okay now load dailymotion video yy at 0000 then two seconds later make sure youre at 0002 and so on synchronizing what everybody sees    im only going to use youtube dailymotion and archive org so you wont need to have userscripts going like a lot of cytube channels  i think chrome yells at you to make sure you want to allow archive org to run in the page but otherwise it should be pretty straightforward  thats what the current three video loop is set up for so you can make sure your stuff can deal with it
  gunparade orchestra episode 4 is a christmas episode though its not like a we gotta save santa type episode and more of a okay stuffs still going on but also its christmas episode its still got christmas music and celebrations but im not sure if theres a requirement for how christmasy an episode has to be
  space battleship tiramisu episode 6 at least the first half
  yeah most of whats listed should be there
  oh shit almost forgot about that    yeah theres some missing but thats got at least some more santa monster is going to eat the presents type stuff
sdf macross 35
  anyone else thinks this sounds like it could almost be christmas music  all it needs is some sleigh bells and its the perfect santa taking off theme
now that the dust has settled what do you think about gundams 40th anniversary projects  gundam the origin tv edit of the 6 episode ova series april 2019   new gundam build series 2019   sd gundam world sangoku soketsuden 2019   reconguista in g film 2019   gundam hathaways flash 3part film
  only interested in hathaway and build if the old cast is back the rest are just old stuff
gundam the origin tv edit of the 6 episode ova series april 2019   new gundam build series 2019   sd gundam world sangoku soketsuden 2019   literally no one asked for these
gundam the origin tv edit of the 6 episode ova series april 2019   yessss  this is all i ever wanted in life
  itll be divers old cast for sure
gundam the origin tv edit  probably going to turn out as painfully misguided as the unicorn one  sd gundam world sangoku soketsuden  is there any more info on this other than the name i really dig sd gundams so im holding out for a new tv project  gundam hathaways flash   should at least be a source of good banter
  gundam the origin tv edit of the 6 episode ova series april 2019   probably going to be as unnecessary as the unicorn one  new gundam build series 2019   will watch if they dont hire watada again otherwise wont even bother  sd gundam world sangoku soketsuden 2019   i enjoyed sangokuden so ill probably watch this  reconguista in g film 2019   gundam hathaways flash 3part film  will watch
  whats up with all of these pictures of xuniverse mcs  i really hope we get a tournament style basically super robots that showcases all of the mcs best gundam
im cautiously optimistic about hathaways flash and the greco movie   origin reedit seems silly to me why turn a movie into a series isnt it usually the other way around
  the origin tv doesnt make any sense since you can see the ova on youtube
  so what was gundam beyond just pictures is it a teaser for a show or something do we get to see amuro handing banagher his whiny ass who am i kidding by this point theyd have banagher win to wank the unicorn more
  looking forward to hathaways flash and build divers 20 will watch sd    just pictures
  gundam the origin tv edit of the 6 episode ova series april 2019   sure why not if toonami dubs any older shows its just going to be met with scorn because its not pretty cg    new gundam build series 2019   ill be happy if they make either a custom epyon or blitz using a fresh new mold     sd gundam world sangoku soketsuden 2019   will probably watch just for cheesy acting    reconguista in g film 2019   hoping we actually get an ending this time and not whatever the final episode was    gundam hathaways flash 3part film  nobody is going to give a shit only hardcore uc faggots that eat anything up are going to buy the xi or the penelope everyone else will be put off by the uber clusterfuck designs that make unicorn blush
ibo/00 poster was the most discussed thing by nips online  its just album artwork  leaking hathaways flash months ago really hurt the event
  re96 did it first
  greco film and hathaway trilogy are the only worthwhile things to come from it
i dont know if this is the best place to ask but does the origin ovas have any signs or songs cause all the torrents only have full english pgs subs
legit mad i stayed up for it it was the most boring pointless bullshit the only thing im impressed with is how japan manages to be completely emotionless when it comes to something as awesome as 40 years of giant robots what a country
  nothing really surprising the gundam beyond theming was miles cooler than anything actually announced  origin tv   if its anything like unicorn it wont be worth watching  new build  the series has been mediocre at best after the first show so i dont really care   sd gundam world  actually looking forward to this sangokuden is underrated as fuck  g reco film  might be cool but the series already had a problem with being too compressed so im not sure if turning it into a film will help much  hathaways flash  im looking forward to it but trying to keep my expectations low
  some anon posted this a while ago  not sure where he got this though since i couldnt find any info on the gundaminfo site
why narrative gundam is so cool
hobo gundam
  narrative only works as an sd i swear
  sd form hides the distinguished features of nt gundam
    that looks pretty good
  why cant you speak english
tsukame puraido  tsukame success
  no fucking way
  so its actually happening its not dead and it will come out next year fuck cant say im not excited
  is it not just compilation movies
  so are 0079 movies and zeta ant
  according to the presentation and what tomino has been saying its a compilation/remake with a bunch of added sequences new story stuff new suits etc greco 1 comes out spring/summer and then hathaways flash 1 comes out in the fall
  please god let them have more screentime
  with those two come out that year it means that sunrise reach their quota of releasing 23 movies every year do they  so are they gonna keep releasing greco and hathaway regularly for the next 3 years
the world is not square
  g reco is actually getting its three hundred and fifty seven movies  i cant believe it tomino actually came through for us
  it depends hf is all new while greco is only partially new if you go by the report back in 2017 when they confirmed the movies were still alive bandai said 5 greco movies were in production  hathaways flash is getting three films/episodes which will probably come out every other year greco will probably come out every year since theyre compilation films with new content then they might move on to unicorn 2 f90/91 crossbone or a new story
wuxia soon
  meanwhile in bizarro greco
  i like that we are getting more greco but ive always been meh on compilations unless tomino gets his crazy plan of 5 billion movies im not too bothered chances are it will just cause shitposting depending on how well or poorly it does     just give me the gself mg
  what does it mean
  2019 movies are they supposed to be post episode 26
japanese twitter seems pretty happy about it
i was gonna watch greco next month should i wait at least until we know how the movies are
  probably not a bad idea to watch the tv show first some people seem to struggle with it the first time around but when they give it another go have a much better experience
im curious to see if tomino can manage to improve on the show i liked greco but i think it strains under some weird decisions when it comes to priorities    that said as much as id like to see greco hit its potential id rather have tomino directing the hathaways flash movies
  is he finally gonna remember that the garcane is capable of turning into a waverider
give it to me tomino im ready to watch
  this is real
  some of the movies will have to be postseries if theyre making 2019 of them
after the first gorillion compilation films i dont think sunrise really benefits from writing reconguista off as a loss when they do their taxes
  plz dont cut best boy out
  if you enjoyed any tomino show that was made after zeta youll probably enjoy greco just fine
    these niggers would disagree
hopefully the definitive version of greco does well enough that we start to get mgs or at least rgs since the mg line is dead of some of its suits
so are we going to see an rx105 gunpla
give me my kit
  why does the g lucifer have hax funnels and the moonlight butterfly did someone have a hardon for that unit
  greco is a warning about letting crazy people who know nothing about the struggles of life get weapons and militarize git labs had access to all of the data from uc and decided to very casually bring back apocalyptic weapons just to see what they could do
  it is the spawn of the devil gundam in a prototype form    or perhaps the devil gundam will eventually adapt to its frame
  wait so was git just a bunch of mad scientists
i watched 3 episodes of the anime and i have no ideal what the fuck is going on the way it starts episode 1 even made me deep dive the internet to make sure there wasnt a season before this one what a shitty way to start an anime nothing you say can defend this fuckery
  anon thats a cube not a square
  not the anon youre talking to but yeah pretty much that
  mad scientists that wanted to go back to earth and were convinced using the data from the rose of hermes would help them reconquer earth  most of it is in the show but theres also databook shit and the short they did where gself and garcane fought gphenex gphenex was remade using reguild century technology in an effort to understand psycommu and psycoframe systems that short will forever make unicorn fans and fukui mad because gphenex is canonically the strongest unicorn unit ever made
  from the short it appeared as if mask didnt quite know about the full capabilities of the phenex in the hands of someone who doesnt act surprised when his beam magnum runs out after 5 shots theyd probably fight much more cautiously only going all out once a weakness has been figured out to be exploited like hell
  that short was also the one that confirmed bellri is a newtype since the ntd system took over once bellri started giving off kono pressure waves  the thing though you have to remember is that no one in greco was a hardened veteran the only time people actually start fighting like theyre capable is the last quarter of the show gphenex short takes place around the time they arrive at towasanga  plus since gself has no newtype weapons the unicorn type really has no inherent advantage gself was build around utilizing photon energy whereas even with the psycoframe the unicorntype is still minovsky fusion based
  the phenex was upgraded to use photon energy
  i like to think of them as a bunch of mad uc fanboys the type who fit the wow cool robot image gaeon is even in amuros colours    i remember one interview tomino mentioned a lot of fans went into tech or military jobs when really that misses the point you arent meant tio idolize what is shown i think he said greco was partly meant to appeal to a different type of person
  aida was a flat earther
  literally or figuratively  both yes
  in that ova the phenex appears to be immune to beam sabers  56 hits  but who knows if the original had that function too
  garcane/glucifer dont have the full body photon batteries  only in the head     just needs to merge with the perfect pack
  insight 999jpg
  its actually happening  holy shit i almost lost hope
  bandai said 5 greco movies were in production    no they didnt that was just 2chan and twitter the 40th anniversary announcement is the first time bandai has mentioned any continuation about g reco since the tv show ended also this announcement says its one compilation movie not multiple unlike hathaway where they flat out said it is a trilogy    im frankly worried that now tomino has to either cram 26 episodes into 2 hours or its going to be a partially condensed retelling that has a shit ending to allow the possibility of another movie because sunrise is approving this on a one by one basis
skol
  every time i see that i think its a g gen thread and then i get disappointed
  nice maybe they can fix the dellensen fight scene
  i like the design of greco so i hope for an mg
  is he finally gonna remember that the garcane is capable of turning into a waverider    absolutely not
  its ok because g arcane is cute even without her waverider form being animated in 2d
greco is unfairly gorgeous the whole show is just so beautiful to look at especially the mecha sequences
  whats this from video/link
  is this meant to mess with the person inside too its like drawn in such a way
  agreed
  this time he lived
  stahp
  someday
  oh shit
  she mine
i need it
this is my thread now
  waithamansama is thatnoit cant be
  it is
  so someone cloned the great hamansama  affranchi char where are you
  her plan b
    for fucks sake they sure took their sweet time    cant fucking wait
              hello clone of haman i would like to have a few words with you
fuck
  cutest gundam used by the biggest jobber
hg when
sometimes it looks like she was faking being a tard ep 14 to 17 when the dorette fleet showed up she knew shit was going down
im so happy bros
looks like they did it now give me the garcane full dress the hg kit at least if they put all the time and effort on it they might seriously make it a celibate mg like dynames complete with the basic butt flap to replicate its basic form but only if it they did put back all the cut scenes for the movie that will make it good
  snitches get stiches keep your theory to yourself
then next thing we know someone comes up with the bright idea to build the xi gundam with rg technology resulting in a far more powerful xi than one built with uc specs and containing a photon/minovsky barrier so strong that the pilot basically can kill his enemies just by ramming into them with the barrier up oh and they also create a new mufti nabiyu erin
  containing a photon/minovsky barrier so strong that the pilot basically can kill his enemies just by ramming into them with the barrier up  like in nadesico
  she was behind everything
  me too
its happening
  its real
  yes much worse because an ms sized photon barrier sphere ramming into a massive warship and destroying it is now a plausible thing and dont forget that neomufti is causing trouble on the tower earth and the moon to destabilise the capital oh and the xi is now powered by a reactor not a battery neomufti doesnt give a fuck about sucordism
what if we dropped cyrano5 on earth
  fuck it lets drop the fucking moon on earth
  i like that idea
  now all we need is a rg century built xi gundam with abilities and powers on steroids compared to uc incarnation and a neomufti and were all set
you can see the lust in his eye
  oh fuck
          they have something like this in one of the episodes but i think the yggdrasil is supposed to be superior or something
  or it could just be due to the size
nug is best girl
  literally i remember people going why is he so angry after they talked after finding out she was related to him hes mad because he wanted her as a woman and now he cant
  doesnt he even say something along those lines
  probably i swear half the people watched this show like my friend watched seed on another moniter he didnt look i swear its the only way all those questions and complaints when it was airing makes sense
  the show does expect a lot of its audience
  neomufti  i kind of want uc2 to be about neo mufti but then again theres that awful sinking feeling that fukui will fukui it up
  greco pissed off speed watchers who were used to endless exposition in modern anime and couldnt handle tominos in your face world building
    it was obvious that he had a huge crush on her that just goes to show how fucking retarded greco haters are
  can neomufti exist in the regild century i mean someone can dig up blueprints to phenex perhaps somone else can find plans for xi and the information about mufti hidden away in some lost database that somehow survived all these eons
  theres these super funnels towards the end
  can neomufti exist in the regild century  they are repeating the mistake of the old uc give them some time they make one
is this canon
is greco good i remember when it was airing most people said it was bland
  it can be hard to follow at times but its a fun show
  yes
  and
    these happen within 1 sec  slow motion is used 
      do you have all these images saved
  i do
  bland is the absolute exact opposite of what it was  its definitely a spicy dish that wasnt to everyones tastes
  its definitely anything but bland     its a hella wonky show with weird characters and very questionable story telling but it also looks and sounds great and is rarely boring
  theres political shitstorms and undermining from all sides perfect conditions for a terrorist group like mufti to thrive and go about taking advantage of the clusterfuck to keep themselves outside the attention of the major factions theyll start small under the radar occasional theft and small piracy then suddenly theyll strike right at the heart of the leaderships with photon reactor not battery reactor powered mobile suits and overwhelming firepower
  going for a 00 style
  to tell you the truth the pirate corps and the git laboratory would be the only real threat to mufti    the dorette fleet is a joke so is the capital army
  questionable storytelling  how so because it doesnt give you a retarded viewpoint character to have all the history of a setting explained to them like they were born fully grown a day ago
in the years following the events of greco the whole of earth is now ruled under a single authoritarian dictatorship deploying elite special forces called man hunter agency maha which act as an allpowerful nighautonomous organisation the earth sends what they see as undesirables off to space to work in penal colonies now in the many years following the show the space factions have become weakened by infighting ignorance or covert intervention by the earth enough so that the unified earth sphere now has the political and military clout to become a force to be reckoned with extorting them and silently interfering in their internal politics to favor the earth in these dark times it begs the question is the regild century ready to face a lost legend a revived soul from the universal century just to fight the oppression
why do i like yoshiface so much
  killed 4 security guards because he couldnt bump bump with his neesan
  tomino has to either cram 26 episodes into 2 hours  he already crammed 52 into 26 how bad could this get
  did you like xamd by chance
  its pretty straightforward for tomino
    i hate complaints like this one the one hand there are details that are presented fast and you need to pay attention but on the other there are important things flashed on the screen like yeah those bindi dot people with slingshots used to be raised as food like thats a little important to be artbook data tomino doesnt always shore up everything
  good storytelling presents backstory through action and dialogue not through constant infodumps or through showing you the consequences and expecting you to calculate backwards did i blow your mind
  flashed on the screen like yeah those bindi dot people with slingshots used to be raised as food like thats a little important to be artbook data  but who the kuntala are and is brought up a few times what things that are so important to the main story just get flashed on screen greco repeats info a lot more than people say it just doesnt stop to go we are in exposition mode now so it ends up not being grating like a lot of shows
  right i dont like aldnoah zero style dumps at all please believe this theres middle ground though and tomino rarely makes it there which means you either need turbo autism or a notebook to get whats going on even if you do watch it every week with your full attention like i did you can sort of pick up on whats going on but even then it barely straddles the line between satisfying and disorienting    in my opinion sdf macross handled things just about right the exposition wasnt grating and wasnt too sparse was important to the characters and came at the right time
  through action and dialogue  that is mainly how greco does it    not through constant infodumps   which it generally avoids    through showing you the consequences  i would disagree with that especially as in most shows including greco this will be accompanied by one of the above two i think the problem is you assume calculating backwards is needed when stories do this it is generally set up the feelings and thoughts we get from the event are not meant to be a complete understanding     say in turn a when loran initially pilots it you arent meant to understand where it came from and how it came to be there you are meant to be in awe at the power of the machine and somewhat concerned you dont really understand what is going on especially the less mech knowledge you have but you are meant to gain a feeling and a little knowledge
  but on the other there are important things flashed on the screen like yeah those bindi dot people with slingshots used to be raised as food like thats a little important to be artbook data  because he doesnt need to go too much details in the show because sometimes less is more the only relevant detail is that kuntala used to be the lowest hierarchy we started off thinking that mask was all muh kuntala pride because he doesnt want that stigma anymore but then as the story progress you slowly realize that its just an excuse chip on the shoulder and all that like how char use spacenoid shit as an excuse when in the end its not ideology just a personal thing between him and amuro the show itself dont need to go any deeper about the kuntala during grecos time because that was never the main point kuntala persecution was in the past and while some are still being racists towards them in the end it doenst matter as its just mask using that as justification for being salty towards belri you will become a dictator
  but then as the story progress you slowly realize that its just an excuse chip on the shoulder and all that  i feel like they did a good job at keeping it questionable if he had some good intention which is not unlike char people still cant really agree on him completely despite it getting pretty overt in places
  that is mainly how greco does it  when it does it which it doesnt always like the significance of the earth church and the energy pope they never really explained why they drew the assets for that they take it seriously in the first half of the show but were on the outside looking in which is really my biggest complaint about tomino in general honestly just some dialogue tags would go a long way a character commenting oh thats the x they do y    i think the problem is you assume calculating backwards is needed when stories do this it is generally set up  and i take it as a setup and wait for an explanation but greco is a sea of red herrings    i really liked turn a now that you mention that it could be because we were introduced to lorans stakes right away that he loves the earth and he wants all his friends there and the stakes were kept pretty limited so you could reliably predict the sort of things each faction would do in greco theyre all over the place and youre never sure what theyre fighting for until weve left them behind for a space station called venus that isnt actually venus  you see how this could get confusing
  we started off thinking that mask was all muh kuntala pride because he doesnt want that stigma anymore  honestly i started off thinking he was just a jerk using kuntala pride to justify that we were a proud and noble tribe that got overtaken by technology means something different than we were once the high caste but were overthrown which is totally different from they freaking ate us but in the early show you could derive any of those explanations for kuntala behavior    the show itself dont need to go any deeper about the kuntala during grecos time because that was never the main point  but it could have in a line of dialogue in episode 2 which would have put everything in context
  oh thats the x they do y  no fuck that that shit is one of the things i dislike about common exposition methods it sucks the immersion out of it because its blatantly just the characters saying obvious shit for us the audience i much prefer the ways employed in greco and nihei tsutomus blame throws the viewers in and let them absorb the verse via the way the characters interact by themselves
  which would have put everything in context  we do in latter episodes   episode 2  see thats thing you want early answers im fine with waiting for the show to gradually and naturally reveal more info bit by bit
  i cant believe luin got away with fucking barara
  for us the audience  but they the characters are in a new world bellris out exploring hes eager to find out what all of this is nah youre asking for evangelion rebuildstyle obfuscation for dramas sake    have you read the new translation of blame its characters do a lot more explaining than the crappy translations we used to have which is why raw readers didnt understand why people thought it was confusing      and thats why i was generally disappointed because that info never got revealed you had to guess until the last episode where the end of everyones stories all happened at once not gradual or natural at all
  like the significance of the earth church and the energy pope  why do you seem to keep jumping to new points and not the one you just made     and you can figure it out through how they talk it is refereed to with reverence and formality we learn the whole think is why the earths entire energy gets distributed you can see how it is an important aspect of life on earth which is why all the thing happening around it are important     just some dialogue tags would go a long way a character commenting oh thats the x they do y  that is asking for more of an exposition style you called bad    i really liked turn a now that you mention that  that is nothing to do with the point i made you just go into a complete non sequitur     for a space station called venus that isnt actually venus  you see how this could get confusing  no because they call it the venus globe also thinking it was actually venus would effect nothing they head there because of batteries and shit thinking it was the planet is fine then you see oh it isnt actually the planet you go oh it isnt actually venus at what point does that cause the story to not make sense
  youre asking for evangelion rebuildstyle obfuscation for dramas sake  not really theres more than sufficient info being thrown around simply from the way they interact with each other eva is a terrible comparison as most of the lore etc arent even talked about within the show itself  and yes im talking blame after factoring the better translation it was still not as exposition heavy as the typical scifi manga
  we learn the whole think is why the earths entire energy gets distributed  but everyone treats it with actual piety so theres this weird disjointedness and theres no impact    that is asking for more of an exposition style you called bad  theres a difference between as you know maidandbutler exposition and natural dialogue that explains things    you just go into a complete non sequitur  i explained why i liked turn a and not greco if you dont read you wont understand    at what point does that cause the story to not make sense  because its exhausting for words not to have meanings
  theres more than sufficient info being thrown around simply from the way they interact with each other  again you can derive that but its not plain you can figure different explanations for it but odds are your theory wont make sense by the final episode especially since the final episode was a second season thrown in a blender    blame didnt have to be expositionheavy because it was a simple story with simple characters grecos characters were complex but not explored by the way theres plenty of places in blame where a robot or a cyborg will drop lines of infodump but its natural because theyre explaining things they dont know to each other
  all youve done here is dodge questions while jumping to new points support what you said instead of making leaps to different points    but everyone treats it with actual piety  so that just lends to the viewer understanding how important it is something you said didnt happen energy distribution is a whole religion which is why breaking all the taboos is such a big deal this does not help your new point that was a different one from the initial discussion anyway you failed to support either and just throw around adjectives    theres a difference between   your example wasnt it is straight up hey x is a y    i explained why i liked turn a and not greco  if turn a has other qualities you like is irrelevant it was an example of how the style you said was bad is used you havent supported why it is bad in general or in that case    because its exhausting for words not to have meanings  you mean your misunderstanding of words and venus did not lose its meaning in that case you couldnt actually explain where the story stopped making sense because of your misunderstanding
  i dont understand you what is even your complaint that theres a religion and a pope based around the energy distribution system
  that theres a religion and a pope based around the energy distribution system  do you know what irl religions and popes are based around      energy distribution is a whole religion which is why breaking all the taboos is such a big deal  it is is there a hell where photon pirates go are you blessed by the photon gods for obeying the energy pope    the discussion is about greco not doing exposition right please try to keep up    your example wasnt it is straight up hey x is a y  there were honestly times bellri could have used that    it was an example of how the style you said was bad is used you havent supported why it is bad in general or in that case  yeah i have in turn a we got exposition slowly for a simple world in greco we got exposition slowly for a complex world it didnt keep up which is why id rather we got exposition fast exact same tomino style for both but it worked for one and not for the other    you couldnt actually explain  do you care more about the story or about proving im dumb you sound like youre starting to take this personally which was never my intention
  git labs had access to all of the data from uc and decided to very casually bring back apocalyptic weapons just to see what they could do  is the git labs an euphemism for sunrise itself
  mark ishii became a va with the express purpose of getting closer to bararas va  got married with her  absolute madman
  thats a whole lot of wasted words that mean nothing
  you havent disproven my point 
  you sound like youre starting to take this personally which was never my intention
  it is is there a hell where photon pirates go are you blessed by the photon gods  exactly what i said youd do instead of conceding your point you pull up some tangent about how the religion needs to be explained in detail you cant support what you said so jump to something else    there were honestly times    in turn a we got exposition slowly for a simple world  then your original post is wrong apparently both these things were bad and what not to do now they are okay    do you care more about the story or about proving im dumb  you wouldnt sound dumb if you made better points and could stick to them
  do you know what irl religions and popes are based around  its based around the teachings and customs followed by whoever was the most influential people around who adopted those customs as a way to unite and control people    it is is there a hell where photon pirates go are you blessed by the photon gods for obeying the energy pope  photon pirates get executed the battery pope blesses us with the batteries that come down from the heavens and which the people need to live    whats your point
  instead of conceding your point you pull up some tangent about how the religion needs to be explained in detail  because its relevant to their lives and to my point about essential details being glossed over you havent addressed my point in  about the nature of kuntala pride being relevant so i moved on    apparently both these things were bad and what not to do now they are okay  no apparently exposition through action and character development can be done well or done poorly please try to keep up also turn a has quite a few points where characters explain things watch it again      its based around the teachings and customs followed by whoever was the most influential people around who adopted those customs as a way to unite and control people  again thats a very outsidein view of things to people within the religion theyre not being controlled theyre trying to please the gods and its a visceral and rewarding experience if all you see is the manipulative cynical priest and never any reward for the righteous never any reason someone would say convert you come across as fedora at best    photon pirates get executed the battery pope blesses us with the batteries that come down from the heavens and which the people need to live  then why do you need a religion for it why would you like pray
  i know the madman
  is the regild century ready to face a lost legend a revived soul from the universal century just to fight the oppression  yes
  again thats a very outsidein view of things  and it was someone with an outsidein view of things that created the sucord system in greco and i dont mean just tomino but rc is way after the universal century people know their history and they came up with a multilayered system best designed to control the population obviously its not perfect it is a manmade system after all but i mean theres an obvious need in keeping with the system to continually receive the batteries taboos if broken can result in your battery supplies being cut and even talk of a curse that only the most devout sucordists believe in that time
  and thats why i didnt really connect with devout sucordists which in my opinion would have made the show more enjoyable especially as a lot of characters are devout    my main gripe is i spent the entire show on the sidewalk looking through the kitchen window at people having fun inside i know i could have squinted more but i would have loved to be invited in
i miss the dorette fleet
  its a satire the characters are supposed to be goofy and weird and their particularly weird moments are there to bring your attention to how silly theyre being its not just the sucordists either but look at all the times they go oh its the universal standard every time someone infiltrates an enemy space by hacking the door
  yeah that was a lot of fun their naivety was downright charming which is great because tominos a master of charming    im sure  is right and a second watch would be more enjoyable but i guess im stubborn enough not to want to have to give it a second watch especially since i really was paying attention and i think i actually might have been taking notes its just the exposition really is a little sparse i just care about worldbuilding a lot
  you havent addressed my point in  because that wasnt the same chain of replies wasnt even me you did get a reply to that however and when it was answered made up a new point as the other anon pointed out that isnt an essential detail but suddenly you have a new point    youd make a more convincing case if you didnt bullshit so much one minute this one thing is the biggest issue all this stuff is never explained or made clear next you knew all that all along but actually this is the biggest issue you base an entire point on misremembering a name and then get upset that you were called out on it ignoring the initial point in the process at first showing the consequences of actions before explaining them is bad then you actively avoid ever talking about this point again im being nice by pretending you watched the show but you really give little evidence to make me believe that    this is part of what makes discussing greco hard a lot of the detractors have gaping holes in their knowledge and often dont have a good grasp on why they dislike it and what was done wrong trying to have a discussion when you only have half the facts and jumps ship when you get something wrong is impossible
  you did get a reply to that however  i got a reply but it wasnt about my point    one minute this one thing is the biggest issue all this stuff is never explained or made clear next you knew all that all along but actually this is the biggest issue  did i ever say biggest issue youre reading a lot into this  you base an entire point on misremembering a name and then get upset that you were called out on it  really when  at first showing the consequences of actions before explaining them is bad  in the way greco does it  then you actively avoid ever talking about this point again  you mean i repeatedly explain the way it is and isnt done well  this is part of what makes discussing greco hard  yes fans being hottempered spergs makes it a real chore
what fuck did i miss
  when the blue planet lost its radiance   and peoples prayers became sighs of grief  a single soul transcended time  perhaps that was the harbinger of humanitys awakening
is it possible to rework gaia gear into a sequel for greco changing the technology and the armaments to fit the regild century would be a start
  is it possible to rework gaia gear into a sequel for greco  why
  just a suggestion nothing serious
  im asking how would this work im into this we can make this a side story he was born in the lower part of towasanga
  he kidnaped and raped men
  and hunts down black people
  this thing can seemingly read dna without being in contact with the person
  this two are brother and sister and they look nothing likely
greco is a fun oddity buts its fans really do come off as the most joyless self important spergs
  
  what did i do
did they fuck
  you know it
  yes
  oh thats the x they do y  he says to someone who has lived twenty years with the knowledge of who x is and what they do
      delete this
  actually he vents because of numerous reason    aida as his sister    his home is not earth he is adopted and his bith place is some collapsing rock in space not the glorious capital city    the security picked a fight with him and want to kill him despite they and him are both from the same towasanga
based tomino delivers again
  he promised me the age of age of oneesans    im still waiting
  call me a retard but its harder to process it with subtitles because im reading and watching at once      i understand subtextin david lynch movies somehow so i dont think im that retarded
  be the change you want to see in the world and fuck your sister
  they remind me of gunpla kitbashers    a lot of greco was about how weapons of war feel like toys and games so maybe it was intentional
    promises age of oneesan  makes oneesan character useless
    virginfags ruined everything
    bellri did it again
  not him but i loved it for many of the same reasons i loved g reco for
  well now were in the age of mommies
  according to tomino they have thats why he lost interest in her as a character
  weird creepy old man
  
        from animage april 2015    tomino i guess the bigger problem was aida how did she become such a foolish useless princess maybe her writing just needed more work it feels like the problem was that she never really fit my personal image of a heroine yesterday i got into a bit of a spat with the recording staff when i mentioned a basic assumption i had about aida everyone said mr tomino thats how you thought about her that must be why her character plummeted so far the topic that inspired this reaction whether or not aida slept with cahill   huh  tomino i was sure that aida had slept with cahill i mean it isnt a big deal if a 17  18yearold girl sleeps with a grown man is it but every single member of the staff yelled she didnt sleep with him and absolutely rejected the idea   i think that goes without saying  tomino so in short at this stage in the process i finally noticed that i had lost interest in aida because she slept with cahill i never had any intention of making her shine in the first place thats the reason the character who should have had the most focus didnt shine   i see so you sort of sabotaged yourself then  tomino on the other hand there is a nonmain character who shined in my own mind at least i forcibly piled lines on them in episodes 24 and 26   and which character is that  tomino oh i dont think i need to spell it out for you
  tomino oh i dont think i need to spell it out for you    is my memory really bad that this isnt obvious to me i mean i remember 24 as a barara episode but shes not in 26 so
  oh steer lol    hes not wrong though
  episode 24 destroyed the 3rd super funnel of hers  yggdrasil episode  otherwise shed have 3 of them in this scene
  jeez tomino losing interest in your own characters because in your own mind she slept with someone else what the fuck nigga
  geez tomino
  thank you
  he had a bit of a crush on steers va from what i remember
had a more competent pilot instead of mask been piloting a crossbone gundam instead of gphenex gcrossbone sounds really badass in hindsight they might have given bellri and aida a much harder time even after gself when super saiyan said pilot would also be a lethal crackshot with a pistol explaining how he managed to shoot down aida with only the buster gun leaving the zanbuster configuration and rifle grenade for later once bellri enters the scene then when the fight gets up close and personal out comes the zanber sabres heat daggers scissor anchors and beam markers more ways to keep bellri on his toes and fight for survival
am i char now
  age of oneesans  that used to be my favorite meme
    she has his kid and becomes a single mother
after the final battle with the capital army dorette fleet and the amerian army/pirate corps both towasanga and the git laboratory was left with all the power    spacenoids are the real winner of regild century
  then in comes neomufti which fucks everything up forcing bellri to suspend his pilgrimage to go after these people piloting these lateuc style suits crossbone xi and both victories but with photon technology instead of minovsky heck while were at it lets throw in a gaia gear look alike on steroids with black hole weaponry just to nullify the instant win button on the gself
  lets throw in a gaia gear look alike  i like this some of the people in control of towasanga see neozeon and char as heros of all spacenoids and clone him they team up with git laboratory to take over the earth    capital army teams up with amerian army/pirate corps to save earth
  a very strange mash up of gaia gear and hathaways flash blended in a very weird way and thrown into the reguild century haphazardly yeah im sure well all end up on the other side totally sane and not needing to pick our jaws off the ground upon witnessing all the holy shit moments
  a very brutal fight with bellri being unable to use the instant win move because gcrossbone is relentless in using all of his close range armament to keep the pressure on him sure it ends with gself eventually landing a solid hit stunning the gcrossbone and allowing bellri and aida to escape but still seeing a pirate themed gundam performing all sorts of crazy martial arts punches and kicks as well as savagly fast blade work in an attempt to annihilate the gself completely would be insane said pilot using the psychosuit along with the biocomputer to fully control the ms like his own body would be a nice touch
  is the gcrossbone the one mask called kabakali which had beam tonfas so i have to like it or is this from that short thing they played on the side of a building
  so since i havent watch greco yet is it better off if i just wait for the movie
  that short where gphenex jobbed to gself was really visually awesome but mask was a disgrace to the phenex so hypothetical situation where a gcrossbone was made along with a hypothetical pilot who made full use of all of x1s armaments no peacock smasher or muramasa blaster cause its not full cloth in very insane ways ala tobia to fight gself in a much more epic fight than what was shown on the wall
  yes theyre talking about the short cgi movie that was projected onto the side of a building but theyre also talking about a what if scenario where they are inserting a completely different ms and a imaginary made up pilot that is more competent than mask as an adversary to fight bellri into that movie    the gcrossbone is just a what if they rebuilt the crossbone gundam into rc    
what are the upper limits to gselfs powers
  we dont know since it isnt coming out until next year but youre probably better off watching the show
  rightly or wrongly a lot of people consider greco to be kind of mess or hard to follow story wise    i have severe doubts that compressing this 26 episode series into a 90 minute movie is going to make things clearer
  theyre adapting each episode to theatrical length 
  is this meant to mess with the person inside too  no its just a conveyance of motion in that image
  they were identical twins in the early concept art back when we only knew the project as grekopic related but a lot was changed as production went on    the original story was also supposedly going to focus more on the space elevators
  ippei really likes this particular color scheme
  is that a women
  so if this translation isnt a troll then tomino has officially lost his mind
  bellri on the right aida on the left
  w what
  read the post  their names are in japanese at the bottom  they look similar but there are slight differences  aida has a female body with a slightly more pronounced hip width
  old people troll hard and dirty
  reverse unicorn      disintegrating stuff
  the point is really that he treated her as an average woman instead of a special princess
    tractor beams mask for a good 2 minutes immediately after this scene
  have realistic understanding of your characters and universe  entire staff is man children and wants you to sanitize the story  poor tomino its a wonder he gets anything done
  heat daggers  screw whip now with beam cable  scissor anchors also with beam chains  beam sabers  beam zanber  buster gun  beam zanbuster  beam shield/brand marker x gonna give it to ya  rifle grenade  atomic shell
  beam chains
  that level of detail
  yes beam chains
  not to mention the wicked core fighter and the x configuration thrusters which can converge into a rocket column for massive speed in uc it is already a nightmare to face off against but in reguild with updated building techniques and materials and modifications to the armaments to fit that era better
  this type of machine should be possible by now
  bell was riding one of these in the first fucking episode and had to slam on the brakes and fall over destroying the whole front of the machine we dont have these machines in real life because their design is retarded going from transporting stuff with wheels to transporting stuff with twolegged vehicles is like going back 8000 years of technological development
  but it can jump
    and it can climb mountains
    once youre on it you have to keep going like a shark cause if you try to stop youre dead
considering that spacenoids are better off than the earthnoids in this show it looks as if full frontal emerged victorious in the end sure he may not be alive physically to see it but his ideal of space dominating over earth has come to fruition nice try banana but you were blinded by optimism in the end
  just make a hybrid vehicle with wheels in the feet that can jump over obstacles by deploying the legs  kinda like in rideback
    based fuck his staff
  but tomino decided that his heroine was worthless because he didnt see her as a virgin
  i believe that thing can switch the leg positions to allow it to stop autobalancers
daily reminder    bellri aida mask are all unentertaining main characters  raraiya ringo kerbes klim  mick barara venus globe people megafauna crew even fucking chuchumi are funner characters that make reco worth watching
whens the movie coming out
    bellri and aida each underwent three or four character design revisions the first few of which like that sample image differ greatly from the final results there are some other amusing designs in the artbook like luin wearing harry ordstyle glasses and col kumpa as mask    one of these days ill get around to scanning it
  which one of the eleventybillion
  barara was such a qt
  was
  was
    i swear you can just make out the pilot pod ejecting for a split second shes always alive in our hearts anyway
  that doujin is glorious
  holy fuck i never knew he actually addressed this specific thing before fucking tomino the absolute madman
  yes but it also got caught in the blast ejecting pod means shit see fafner
will we finally get the yellow pack does it corresponds to the photon torpedoes functions in perfect pack
    tfw next to no art of steer  it hurts to have what is essentially a background character as a waifu
  t skeleton none of us are getting boned by you
  huh somebody is sensitive about the nword
  im going to let off a warning nword
  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
    then suddenly  psychoframe
kuntala
  neo zeong
newtype
  big boss
put it in my butt
  sinanju
  well put it in her butt all right
  episode 20 8m36s similar scene there
    and also episode 18 15m36s  17m21s punching a beam saber
  nice
bunp
  phenex has an antibeam coating all the unicorn units have ifield generators too
do you have the others
    yes  yes  yes
  and maybe you should watch brain powerd
  wan mirrion movies
  the supporting cast was good but bellri was a good lead too
    for fucks sake even the creator of the character has to have muh purity virgin princess bullshit
  bbut how will she be my wifu anon
  amerians no sense of right or wrong
amerians have the best mobile suits
    because belli must fulfill the honor of nippon and spill his seed unto her
  i find it weird how they didnt fix it in the bd the scene was even somehow animated in the opening
  fucking tomino the madman
  they really have not a single bad design
had seed destiny not killed ce we wouldnt have unicorn since unicorn essentially repeats ideological stances introduced in seed with banana acting as a discount kira    ce would have flourished as the successor to uc while uc itself would be put to rest instead of suffering through infinite retcons in order to be tied up with unicorn
     the only reason popular thing is part of other parts of the f anchuse is thing is no longer popular   if it stayed popular nothing of it would ever bleed in to other parts of the franchise    thats not a very solid argument it was popular therefore it was going to affect the rest of the franchise whether it stayed popular or not
  banagher is far different from kira banagher willingly participated to save people from the water kiras involvement is only ever dependent on his friends had flay stopped and decided to become a civilian instead of enlisting kira wouldve been gone along with his friends
  flay is the accidental heroine of the ce  this
  had seed destiny not killed ce  ce was dead long before destiny  destiny tried to save it but just ended up digging grave even deeper
  flay wasnt the first of kiras first to and enlist as volunteers as matter of fact she was like the very last too sai and the others join as recruits so that kira wouldnt feel like hes the only one fighting in the mess they were thrown in and lighten up the pressure on him flay didnt really do shit other than make him feel guilty about failing to save her dad
  flay wasnt the first of kiras first to and enlist as volunteers as matter of fact she was like the very last too     no when the archangel reaches earths orbit every civies are given a chance to leave but flay decides to join the army prompting everyone else to follow her
  ce would have flourished as the successor to uc while uc itself would be put to rest instead of suffering through infinite retcons in order to be tied up with unicorn  you are forgetting something important the audience for unicorn thunderbolt and such are the 40odd salarymen who grew up with gundam reruns during the 1980s even if seed wasnt fucked by its sheer incompetence it wouldnt have removed the need to pander to two separate audiences the post2000 kids and the old guys    you could make an argument that it was 00 what wouldnt have happened werent for seeds de facto failure i remember reading some time ago that awakening of the trailblazer was made up from some material leftover from the unproduced seed film    furthermore one of the ces biggest failures was its decision to not explore its setting like the uc had been doing with the ovas and other material it is possible that whats been said for a while about the ce is kira has a bit of truth to it in that regard    apart from stargazer the only thing theyve been doing is astray and that crap is pretty much cosmic era in name only at this point
destiny didnt kill anything  it wrapped up the story neatly so theres no need to carry on with it
  it wrapped up the story neatly  one of these words doesnt belong
  it wrapped up the story neatly so theres no need to carry on with it  as if that has ever been an impediment to keep milking shit forever and ever     even if that were true the ce movie was still in preproduction during destinys run
  wrapped up the story neatly  i guess putting someone in a body bag does count as wrapping them up neatly
are their any mechs that could combat the borg and win/
  people overstate the borg they cant adapt to kinetic weapons for one note how they die to tommy guns species8472s claws and worfs variety of cutting tools and weve seen they cant assimilate everything s8472 again the hirogen and voth though theyre nomadic so that might be a factor and of course data    anyway specify the entire collective or say some oneonone with a cube
    mechscas in giant robots the usual suspects would be fine at least getter emperor mazinger zero elder god demonbane whichever enlarged flavor of gurren lagann you want to count as the biggest actual mech super tengen or arc    actual races of mechanical beings the ultras necrons and daleke should be fine at least i wonder how would cybertronians do     organic species from /m/ shows bydo vajra tyranid and time lords for a start
picard was able to stop them with thelinemustbedrawnheeeeyaaaaahhhh
  the ideon
  a generous application of twin buster rifle followed by 00 quanta sword could do the trick if that fails then break out moonlight butterfly
  they cant adapt to kinetic weapons  literally just us personal shields and physical armour they have both of those
  yet they routinely get fucked up by kinetic weapons then again borg are hilariously tactically inflexible so not surprised
   tactically inflexible  this   remember that the borg assimilate they do not innovate if theyve never assimilated a shield technology which can stop phasers and bullets and can be mounted on a drone they cannot adapt to bullets
    their shields stop phasers yes due to the phase baloney but in fc we see regular holographic whatever tommy guns fuck them up and in voyager s8472 rip and tears them to bits
  you do realize the tommy gun thing was just a one time deal theyd adjust to
  just like they adjusted to being torn apart by s8472 and worf
  races of mechanical beings the ultras  anon the ultras arent mechanical they are energy beings hide inside organic bodies
  dont forget about them having ships with thicker hull plating for battle
  daleke  you mean daleks theyre just small mecha since they have an alien mutant squid in them    though yeah borg would job hard since at the end theyre barely a galactic power and daleks fought a war across the universe as well as time and space
  the daleks fight with energy based weaponry the borg would quickly adapt to
    nooooooooooooo    
try taking down a super cube big as a planet that only grows bigger by absorbing whatever matter comes in contact
  3 impure daleks were able to capture a worm hole and use it to power a robot on their own  yeah i think if even those 3 losers could do that that a dalek empire would shit all over the borg
   remember that the borg assimilate they do not innovate if theyve never assimilated a shield technology which can stop phasers and bullets and can be mounted on a drone they cannot adapt to bullets  the only adaptation theyd need would be stronger body armor the reason for not having it is likely because if a race is so backwards theyre still using ballistics they can be assimilated easily or are not worth the effort
  youd think someone would capitalize on it but then again infantry level combat in trek is ass backwards as hell
  this is just getting easier
    it doesnt really matter because the dalek advantage isnt in technology but in tenacity the time lords have always had equivalent if not superior technology and the daleks continue to be a threat because they just will not give up and will continue to fight no matter how hopeless things are theyll always find a way to bounce back too plus absorbing their weapons doesnt give you equivalent technology since time travel isnt built in to their guns or bodies
  the fact the daleks went toe to travel machine wheel thing with the time lords who rewrote reality to not have magic anymore on a whim and were in fact winning goes to show theyre on a tier of their own
yeah holographic guns completely wreck their shit  emh could rip through them with nanto suicho ken
  daleks travel machines arms are actually modular they can take them off and replace them as needed there was actually a planet in death to the daleks with weird energyfuckery going on where they realised they couldnt use their regular energy weapons once theyd landed so they swapped them out for regular kinetic projectile machine guns just on the fly borg dont stand a chance
at least starfleet can now fight them well since all future ships would have holographic emitters on all decks
  take back all the bad stuff you said about him and his dead wife you bastards he is a good guy and your beloved can do no wrong idol tomino has never had the courage to speak up about injustices like this also greco was a worse mess than seed destiny
anime studios are exploitative  meanwhile grass is green
go shitpost for yous somewhere else faggot
but tomino always hits back on sunrise by creating garbage shows
  pretty ironic coming from a guy who along with his wife was accused of abusing voice actors and animators while working on seed and destiny
  seed had animators
  /m/ believes its own lies because it hates the cosmic era that irrationally much
  no joke im glad his wife died young dispicable people like her that try to ruin other peoples lives dont deserve to live to see retirement fuck him
  despicable people  like you anon
  ooooohhh
  14 hours over four days  has only been ongoing for a month  thats really not that bad theres a lot of blue collar jobs in first world countries that work as long hours as that with more physically demanding work
   14 hours over 4 days    59 hours anon
  my mistake in writing it out 56 hours over four days or 14 hours a day
    its 15 hours and its not horrific on its own id say the unpredictable nature of the hours is worse than the length honestly that said its not exactly great either still at least japan is apparently trailing a 4 day work week so thats progress
  when did his wife die
  just a few years ago 2016 maybe
  irrationally   any hate towards ce is inherently rational
  you probably think the likes of zeta victory and greco are good then and are thus a fool unaware of his own stupidity
  working like that for a month might be okay but doing it for years will probably fuck her health up    well assuming she doesnt cave into corporate pressuring her into marrying a coworker and retiring
  shots fired
  fukuda stood up for production assistant  fukudas a good guy11  bragged about the female lead of cross ange having sex with a guy for over a day  tries to fuck up the careers of two voice actors because they called out his bullshit  gets jealous because that voice actor and his female colleague got married afterwards  wanted tomino to notice him like the underclassman he was    fukuda needs to pull the other one and apologies for thinking he can anything gundam this fucker
  a collection of things that make no sense and never happened  calm down eslkun
  theres a lot of blue collar jobs in first world countries that work as long hours as that with more physically demanding work  and those jobs pay way better
        are we being invaded by leddit
  posting with only a reaction image is part of what makes 4chan 4chan
  anime studios treat their workers like shit  what a shocker
    this fukuda is notorious for lying and for being something of a yes man compared to other directors     not that i dont doubt that working on an anime is a hellish experience but this is fukuda were talking about
  female production assistant  yes im sure he worked her very hard 
  murosawa was smote by god with cancer because how badly she handled seed destiny   this is fact
  utterly magnificent
     do you think you could clarify what was morisawa so hated for exactly
japanese in general are worked to the bone i dont think unions are even a thing in japan
  yes they did  they created some of the best scenes in the franchise further proving that seed and seed destiny are the best gundam shows
  fucking up everything  botched the plot  botched the characterization of cagalli athrun and shinn because of irl drama  turned in scripts late  causing animators to have next to no time to animate anything  leading to overuse of stock footage even unto the final episode of destiny  and the staff couldnt say fuck off of course because she was the directors wife
  those two shows have two memorable scenes between them  first rau le creuset mdking fllay  second pic related
    was there ever actual definitive sources for that stuff was it an open secret or was it just rumors i wouldnt exactly trust fukuda on this stuff but at the same time hes the only one ive ever seen sourced quotes about any of it when he talked about how murosawa handed every script in on time
  anything with shitnn is not best
  cagallis voice actress refused to work on any gundam related properties for over a decade after destiny because of badly morosawa tried to fuck up her role
    the part about late scripts was actually posted by a disgruntled animator at the time it caused a fairly big commotion since something like that rarely happens     the cagalli bit is just a rumor but it was a rumor during the show itself after it ended her va mysterious stopped reprising that role for years after the ending of destiny and products released right around that time which seemingly gave more weight to the rumor
  zeta didnt have a boring protagonist that shat out droll narratives pushed down onto him by the director in a very transparent wayall the while going against those same ideals he claims to be upholding all the while were supposed to feel something for his onedimensional struggle
  also greco was a worse mess than seed destiny    lets not get carried away now
  zeta didnt have a boring protagonist that shat out droll narratives pushed down onto him by the director in a very transparent wayall the while going against those same ideals he claims to be upholding all the while were supposed to feel something for his onedimensional struggle  you hypocrite kamile was insufferable in a dull petty way in cast full of characters impossible to care for and the series had morals that have nothing to do with the real world souls weighed down by gravity
  wants to still keep on denying the truth
  who were the two voice actors whose careers he tried to fuck up
  souls weighed down by gravity  people doing bad things because of their obsession with the past and refusing to move forward and make things better because of it is totally relevant to real life
  shinn and cagallis voice actors
  anybody got anything going in depth about this im interested
  the rumor mill goes that morosawa was acting abusively to cagallis va accusing her of sleeping with her husband suzumura and sakamoto stepped in to support her against the treatment so morosawa threw their characters under the bus too    the brain tumor was probably responsible for both the episodes of psychosis and the delayed scripts
  zeta victory and greco  t celet always going for the lowest hanging fruit
  which at the end worked since shinn was an ass through all the series and cagalli basicly fucked up everything she tried until she just sticked to politics
  sorry but no fukuda is a fucking tool
  shinn was an ass and cagalli was incompetent because morosawa wrote them to be like that you fool  do you think fictional characters just spring to life with no external stimuli
the guy is seriously triggered that seed was excluded from the 40th anniversary thingy isnt he
  which at the end worked  no it didnt it just wound up turning into a repeat of the latter half of seed    shinn was an ass through all the series  because all the focus he could have gotten went to athrun and kira repeating their character arcs for no reason other than fans whining that they wanted more of them    cagalli basicly fucked up everything she tried until she just sticked to politics  which made no sense whatsoever since the whole reason she got kidnapped by kira in the first place is because she was supposedly shit at politics which makes even less sense considering the reason she fell out of power in the first place is because yuna was a twazz who had under the table dealings with the earth alliance
  no shinn got married to lunas va
  kira repeating their character arcs  kira didnt even have a character arc in destiny he was bland as hell hardly a character at all he was nothing like seed kira he didnt even really emote and they had to add scenes of emotion in the special editions like when he realized the freedom was behind those doors the most emotion destiny kira had was shocked faces
  dont you mean 4channel
  i dont see a single problem from this    kira didnt even have a character arc in destiny he was bland as hell  who cares aside from /y/ners from /tv/ and mahq character development is overrated anyway
  nice mouth does it speak dialogue
  25 million yen  5    m  i  l  l  i  o  n    y  e  n
  someone post that composite gif of heavyarms firing
  wing was low budget that excuses some stock footage but when your budget is 25 million yen per episode theres no goddamn excuse
  now thats humor
  flay was supposed to be a human bomb and blow up killing kira and the rest of the ship and taking athruns arm  this wouldve done poorly with most audiences but current /m/ would eat this shit up
  the thing is stuff like the heavyarms doing the same shooting pose the zz gundam transforming or gaogaigars combination sequence make perfect sense for being stock footage since its something that can be continuously be reused every episode or so since its just a common shot the seed/destiny scenes in  are exactly that scenes the legend gundam mimicking the providence gundams movements makes sense since the legend is derived from the providence but theres no reason for the same framing to be used for the akatsuki three different versions of the same scene with three enemy ms in the same position being shot down by offscreen dragoons followed by one dragoon shooting a grunt in the same position in the chest so that it blows up the same way in all 3 scenes followed by the same lazy cool guys dont look at explosions pose which only works for the providences version of the scene due to the shading the other two lack reusing the same fight choreography multiple times between two seasons is just plain lazy and i cant think of another show that does it three times let alone twice     not to mention a show with a budget like seed destinys shouldnt have shit like this happening
    im mostly looking for it cause i lost it and this seemed like a convenient excuse to ask for it
  assuming the thing about late scripts is true it makes sense that they would do that shit so much
    /y/ners  nice mouth does it speak dialogue  there are now multiple people who use those shitty expressions i always thought it was only one shitposter but he somehow multiplied
  what is samefaggotry
  but arguing with himself over that wont make other people post inflamaroty resposnses or anything
  he got one from you
  25 million per episode  holy shiet
  please im losing sleep over this how was this derived from rio
  the cherry ice cream bullshit is derived from rio apparently duran duran is overrated anyway japan is superior
gundam seeds animation so good they animated it twice      you could have both  
fukuda fucked cagallis va  lucky fuck
  different japan bruv  
  just because he did something good for once still doesnt mean seed destiny didnt suck hot ass and his talentless cunt of a wife deserved to die
  she deserved not to be hired by sunrise again at the minimum
  and its a fairy tale marriage by all accounts
  pretty much thats how all japanese works
  fuckin grade a bants
  i imagine god doesnt like his son having competition      werent some of the dumber things in seed and gsd actually the result of the execs demanding certain things and fukuda just going along with it no matter how silly they were      still one of the most expensive anime ever made iirc        im honestly surprised they gave him cross ange
  there has to have been some kind of embezzlement that went on there seed destiny is up there with escaflowne as one of the most expensive anime ever but its animation in no way reflects that
  cenigger  talking shit about zeta and victory
  duran duran is overrated  japan is better  if you had said flock of seagulls i mightve almost agreed
  
  muh uc  muh grandpabots    look at this dude
  he thinks going lol theyre old is going to draw attention away from the shitshow of nonsense science fujo pandering and shit zoids rejects that is ce
  flock of seagulls  not tears for fears
fukuda hates x  holy mother of based
  aw shit i forgot about those truly patrician taste
  kira didnt even have a character arc in destiny  thats exactly my point he was bland in seed too      character development is overrated anyway  found the tv tropes faggot
  character development is goo
i always thought of fukuda as the creep in this and miku is gundam
    fukuda readily admitted he made changes to the narrative just to sell more model kits the most blatant example was dearka defecting to the three ships alliance just to try and move some more buster gundam kits
  tales shit  ew
  found the tv tropes faggot  if anything thats the opposite of the tvtropes position
  whered you get that because from what i know thats never been said anywhere
  its rumored most of the budget went into advertising/making toys and games and paying off magazines and websites for inflating reviews for the series in japan
    thats seeds budget which was 253x the budget of the typical anime at the time destiny had the budget of another anime on top of that
  the tv tropes position is a good character needs to fit into this many recurring archetype/concept checkboxes
  he was nothing like seed kira  he was exactly like post strike explosion kira from seed he was just totally static from that point on and had nothing to play off of like flays death
what is he working on anyway
  you cant change the industry unless the price of anime is increased or they decide to make less anime   either way not happening
  it seems to be a combination of factors fukudas main goal was to make something exciting and action packed not thinking too heavily about the story attached when one of the producers wanted the series to push we should never fight this led to seeds general hypocrisy then there was demands to push certain toys as well as his wife handing in scripts late so there is little to no revision of the writing
  except she never had a brain tumour you convenient retard    all anyone can really say about morosawa is that she was a physically ill person with an obsessive compulsion about her characters were scripts late because she insisted on correcting every script even while she was too sick to handle that kind of work load sure did she get mad at suzumura because she wasnt portraying her yaoi fantasy about shinn right some time maybe do i think that jumps to she was mentally retarded and thought her husband was cheating so she sabotaged the show through anything but 2ch shitposting not a chance    athrun getting split from cagalli because it was getting in the way of him taking it up the pooper from kira is more likely than 95 of the shit you see posted on /m/      akatsuki is maybe 5 less related to providence than legend from an out of universe standpoint
  i remember him being so upset at the animator criticizing the production in a way typical japanese work culture way saying that the employee airing his grievances was insulting to the rest of the crew
  after publicly posting a tweet tacitly holding sunrise responsible for any future ill health of their employees as a result of their business practises probably not a lot
is gundam seed even worth watching im curious about the series because of how much i see it being mentioned but it all just looks like a worse retread of 0079
  athrun getting split from cagalli because it was getting in the way of him taking it up the pooper from kira is more likely than 95 of the shit you see posted on /m/    this is just purely contradictory to how athruns character was handled in destiny by the end of the series meer luna and meyrin had all wanted in his pants at some point or another and seeing as shinn and luna kira and lacus and athrun and meyrin are the present parties in the series epilogue its apparant that they were a couple    what happened to cagallis relationship with athrun and its nonexistance within seed destiny is either due to incompetence or malice on morosawas part but i cant see how she would absent mindedly destroy 2 characters relationship that doesnt make any sense
  aww shit i hurt myself laughing
  from what i can tell the actual problem she was having during that time were uterine fibroids theyre usually not a big deal but they can get bad enough cause a whole shit ton of problems in some women like nonstop pelvic and back pain    so chances are that she was in pain the entire time but insisted on working anyway
  its thoroughly mediocre if i were you id watch something else but its not going to be a _complete_ waste of time
  except there is not evidence of fukuda mistreating voice actors there was one instance with cagallis va but that was more on a personal drama
  i cant see how she would absent mindedly destroy 2 characters relationship    isnt that exactly what happened to dearka and miriallia
  is miriallia even in seed destiny i honestly cant remember her being present
  perpetuating this myth that seed kira already became destiny kira the moment he got freedom in the original show    fucker got freedom trashed by the three rando screaming druggies two episodes before seeds finale and athrun had to bail his pathetic ass while he cried like a little bitch baby that actually happened onscreen why am i the only person who remembers this timeline    no destiny kira came out of nowhere and made no sense nothing about connects back to his personality even in very very late seed
  shes still on the archangels bridge its mentioned in an offhand comment that she dumped dearka between shows despite them being one of only two naturalcoordinator pairs in the whole series and their subplot being a relatively lowkey microcosm of the themes and message of the whole first show but then destiny comes along and the message seems to go from people can overcome prejudice and come together despite racial differences to stay with your own kind
  the movies are okay but yeah its just 0079 with worse characters setting and plot
  you only figured this out now
  best reason ive ever heard of for watching seed and destiny is so you have context to a decades worth of doujins  even then youre better off with the compilation movies
  im not going to say seed is actively worth watching but its not a disaster its the sort of melodramatic storytelling thats appealing to teenagers    a general rule on /m/ is that no show is as bad as people say it is
  the original seed is okayish stick with the compilation movies for destiny
  except active raid that was lovecraft levels of what did i just watch fuck ar destiny wishes it could be even one percent that bad
  you said it wrong its cool mouth does it talk with dialogue get it right you yutz
  kira and lacus literally sleep in separate beds to keep their relationship so platonic and vague that you can self insert whatever most likely gay shipping you want meyrin is not even remotely presented as a serious relationship shes legitimately just a girl than hangs on to him that hes too nice to tell to fuck off    you cant even hang seed for this because wing 00 and ibo are even more blatant feldt will never ever get the meister dick and even uc has stuff like replacing beltorchika with chan off screen so that amuro isnt in a committed relationship while people outright speculate chars girlfriend is just for pretend thats as much a part of how business is done in gundam as plastic model kits
  destiny kira complaint isnt about his piloting skills its about how before his last fight in strike he was written with the intention of being a deconstruction of super pilots his character arc back then was about him getting all the expectations put on him as a coordinator and all the pressure nearly everyone kept shoving on him an his frustration with trying to meet up to them as aswell as do what he wants too only to fail and feel like uttershit because of it then he got freedom and his entire character development from the first half of seed disappears he just becomes lacuss lapdog with barely anything he beliefs he has for himself
  i wouldnt even call that a problem of gundam as a franchise but in anime as a medium authors are so non committal with writing serious relationships that fans seriously do have to jump to conclusions because characters interaction are deliberately left vague and unanswered
  my personal headcanon was that athrun was trying to set up shinn x luna from about episode 20 and everything that happens from there is a precarious balance between shipping keeping people alive and stopping durandal
  active raid is a top contender for one of the blandest bythenumbers shows ever fuck the time i wasted on it    not even great fap material courtesy of asami and madoka were enough to save it
  yeah look at him and his superior taste
          yea think ill give it a pass and just finish ibo and then watch victory and turn a   so you have context to a decades worth of doujins  that was actually a compelling argument lol seed is the only gundam series with yuri doujins ive ever seen  i dunno maybe ill give the compilation movies another shot
should i watch the ovas or the anime recut
  ova tv cut is literally the same thing with a small handful of redrawn scenes early on but terrible pacing since its cutting every episode in half and spoilerfilled openings and endings
  the tv show is considered the definitive version its pretty much the same shit with some redrawn shots not unlike what youd see in a bd release its a bit awkwardly edited since they had to figure out how to turn an ova with seven 1hour long episodes into a conventional 30min program not a big deal since youd probably be binging several episodes at a time anyway     if youve only seen the ova youre not going to missing out on anything important
  the tv show is considered the definitive version    says who the pacing is totally fucked and has a dreadful op and ed that are just slapped onto the beginning and end of each episode
  whatever you have access to they have it the ova version on netflix so ive been watching that at the gym lately
no reason to watch the tv version its just the ova with bad editing
there is exactly only one redrawn scene on the tv edit this hand    watch the ovas and then just see the op/ed clips from the tv for their new musics
  thats so fucked up
  dreadful op  shittiest taste on /m/    kek
lets imagine what a lego gundam range would be like
    id prefer to imagine a lego gundam game honestly though even then i think theyd need to change things up a bit since i havent finished the last two i played getting rid of cars entirely would be a good start since theyre such a vestigial element of most of the games    theres a chance of either in a few years when the legendary film releases though so thats nice
  lego generally has a policy of not associating with more violent content so it seems unlikely sure lego kits have weapons and theres other partnerships with franchises that do feature fighting and combat and shit star wars etc but they wont have anything to do with more mature or more realistic content and will still keep actual violence to a minimum in their marketing and packaging i mean in the games and movies its always been very cartoonish violence    but hey this means mega bloks could pick up the opportunity
lego zgok vs gm cold district set
  well this is supposed to be for fun imagining what lego would do with gundam
  well its not like gundam thrives on violence and gore but i feel like anything produced in partnership with lego is gonna be largely kids stuff with much less emphasis on battle or weapons and largely just an even more accessible version of gunpla
naturally an obligatory ucs rx782 lego set
  just a thought experiment imagining what sets we might get
  mega actually did pick it up once
  i feel like mega bloks would really be a better fit for gundam they have a knack for realistic texture for their blocks and their minifigures are really good    but a mobile suit lego kit would be pretty cool
  when did this happen and how did i miss it
              i dont really know when came across these a while ago i think it was here actually
  are these about mg scale they look like it
      last one i got sorry
      they used to have these things in a hobby shop i worked at a long time ago i was always tempted to get one but employee discount didnt cover it and the owner had put a ridiculous price on it
  company and toy market in general is going downhill every second  defending their ass so hard on big hit series star wars marvel etc so much they even made fucking overwatch   one of the biggest franchise in toy history  asiansmost importantly chinese will buy shitton of it   if gundam movie makes it in west theres literally no reason to not make it
  the suits at lego are remarkably old school and are only interested in playing it safe bionicle g2 flopped because it was out of their comfort zone and they probably wanted it to fail anyway they saw sales records that were below predictions and cut the line before a promised third year was fulfilled they dont even care about one of the most unique properties they created that almost saved them from bankruptcy     gundam does not have the following that overwatch does in the west until theres a gundam series that achieves that level of success and manages to be on the same level in regards to gore its not going to happen the designer the voltron set said that it was an uphill battle every step of the way to get everything approved the closest thing to a gundam line that may ever happen is a new exoforce line or something
  yah a lego gundam game would be awesome i doubt itll ever happen though would love to see the cutesy legolized gundams and protags doing sketches and what not
  it would probably be one of those bionicle or pseudo bionicle kits like those new star wars ones or something like exo force       im not seeing much of a difference in the level of violence shown in star wars vs gundam
  im not seeing much of a difference in the level of violence shown in star wars vs gundam  star wars action is largely bloodless doesnt really linger on death and is considered sanitized enough that children can watch it generally with parental guidance people fall down very cleanly after getting shot or stabbed and they just disappear in or get tossed around by explosions    on the other hand gundam is occasionally gory and morbid and a lot of the stories do tend to focus on death and loss people get injured and bleed its not like violence makes up a large part of gundams appeal but its still there    in any case lego passed on partnerships with call of duty and even halo due to them being perceived as having violence on a more mature level however they did partner with blizzard for overwatch probably due to overwatch having a relatively positive message and the combat being bloodless
  nigga just make lego sd gundam
  but they already did
  gundam is about as violent as star wars  lego would just choose to do the safe stuff and not make model kits like   0078 operation british playset  1488 ghirens speech  6969 maridas childhood
  kek
   new from lego the rms179 gm ii now with realistic exploding action
got you guys covered
  lego doing knee joints  for real theyd use ccbs like hero factory or the sw action figures for 1/100 scale sets and with certain frames a zeta gundam isnt out of the question due to how it transforms in 1/144 scale
welcome anonsan
  wheres my gunpla bitch
  hwere gunpla
  is your son home

  oh hey do you happen to have a momokapool and an rxzeromaru in stock im trying to aim for a full collection
  sauce

  how the fuck did a world war 1 british army officer get in here
  nevermind found it  comic18 nanatsu no kagiana nanakagi satoshi netorin  
  i would unironically buy gunpla from seis mom    id also screw her brains out if given the opportunity but thats a completely separate issue
  i heard you guys got a new shipment of rg kits can i see them
isnt roleplaying the lowest form of posting
ay yo boss     where da valkyries at
is mr ral here i came to deliver his dom kits he ordered
is it just me because you kinda sound like  nono way  captain ramius
      you guys are alright
  woman give me the strength to purge build divers
  turns around and leaves just to see her reaction
  is this where i can buy votoms merch
a nice supportive mother and wife  gets raped ntred and all manner of nasty shit done to her in doujins  why do the japanese have this incessant need to destroy everything nice is it because they were bombed too hard
  so is this doujin about sei getting banged by customers whilst his mom leaves him alone at the store or about rinko getting banged at the salon
  what do you want all porn to be of her having sex with her husband under the sheets
  no im just curious as to what drives this need for degenerate themes in porn hell the germans are known for their fucked up porn but in all those porn theres at least i dunno consent
  because people have nasty fetishes
is this a local market or international one
  theres this one tag called vanilla for people like you
  do you have tthat
  
  why doesnt the 2d waifu consent  anon calm your autism     the answer to your question is the backlash of social conservatism that was prevelant in japanese culture and it isnt the only one the same is true of the me and parts of europe     limiting self expression for so long leads to a counter culture of extreme expression similar to the case of the marquis de sade
  howdy my fellow murican i heard yall sellin model kits here do yall got any military model kits to be specific american military model kits
sei is cuter than rinko im not even a shotafag but this is the undeniable truth
  best rinko

    ʖ 
  let me show you my custom build miss

  i wonder if rinko actually manages to give him shinning gundam
  no she should tenderly take reijis virginity
  
    bellri is too alpha to have the bad kind of threesome hed totally wreck aida and noredo at the same time though    bareback no warning shots either
  artist went private
  somebody should make a gendum model
  sei getting banged by customers  where do i sign up
  gundam g no reconquista ep 17 i think
  let me help you with that
buy more gunpla anonsan
  no fuck bandai
  how about know
  not a virgin    ill just look elsewhere
closest thing to a build divers thread i saw so ill just say a few things now that i finished it  it was fucking boring  bandai really wanted to go after the furry market this time didnt they  daniels tequila gundam needs a kit   the three main kids were s o b o r i n g would have been nice if girl only joined to get riku and boy 2 to join her soccer club only to find out she actually liked gunpla but noooo she just melted into the background after she joined the team  its kind of sad how the best episode in the show proved how lame the new format is  koichi should have been the main character  kyoya is the biggest fate/stay night fanboy isnt he  we need a spinoff of daniel going after high ranking divers  i actually kinda liked ayames story arc if koichis whole neet learns to love something again story would go over little kids heads then surely her story of learning to move on after all your friends drift apart makes her main character material  1st op was a bit awkward but better than 2nd op which was generic anime rock song both eds sucked  speaking of the 2nd ed you just know it focuses on sarah so much because she does nothing but be a plot device and instead of making her likable to make her potential sacrifice actually matter they pull this subconscious bullshit   know what would have been cool sarah panics and becomes the final boss/queen of the bugs to save her own ass by breaking the game so she can stay alive and the build divers are trying to save her from herself but she isnt allowed to be anything but generic moeblob waif  riku is so generic i cant even get mad about it  his friend is supposed to be the gunpla artiste but koichi fills that role on the team and riku got more focus in that department than him so boy 2 is even less of a character than riku to the point his focus episode is about him wanting to be more like riku  overall the best thing i can say about it is im glad its over but im actually a little worried
  bandai might actually stay with this almost entirely shit cast for season 2
  its kind of sad how the best episode in the show proved how lame the new format is
  anon delete this 4channel is a sfw site
  we have that
  roleplaying used to be ridicule for being gaia gear forum tier
no candy section    shit store
  should ps one with grimoire red beret
  
best pick up line in asia ive heard    i love your blond hair i wish i had hair like yours    well i cant give you blond hair but i ciuld certainly give it to your kids
  hi can i get a box of terminators and some leadbelcher paint
hi can i get a scopedog and some dubs
can get a moon gundam and a hug please god damn it why do i love rinko and women like rinko so much its a shame shes married and fictional
  i dropped the show after this fight because i realized it wasnt going to become a turning point
  lacquer fumes
  hey i ordered the special gunpla in the back ill need your assistance to burst it out of its box
shame she attracts so many ntrfags but on the bright side mods know what mongrels to ban now
  does it really count as ntr when her husband is rarely there
  yes  you fucking degenerate
  but if the husband doesnt know im fathering more children with his wife does it really count
  yes  you fucking degenerate
  saucenao
  thats not how genetics work
  yeah but they dont know that
    does it count as ntr if im fucking her in front of sei to spite for him having friends and family he shares his hobby with
  fucking hell man that image only in japan
  what is the name of plamo in her hand
  phil    its name is phil
  deep forbidden its a dagger variant using the forbidden gundams loadout and systems
  1st op was a bit awkward but better than 2nd op which was generic anime rock song  okay no one can have taste this bad the first op literally stole the smoke on the water riff and then slapped a bunch of crappy rap in it at least the generic anime rock song doesnt make me want to stab my ears
  wives and milfs are ntr magnets by nature every male in the vicinity wants to tap that
  thanks /m/an
cant wait for sei to grow big boobs like his mom
  big boobie shemale sei  would build model kits with
  tfw no doujins where sei is an older teen and is a trap with a stuffed bra and gets molested by his classmates
tfw local store had really nice girl clerk that you could always talk about modelling techniques and models themselves  was too scared to ask for contact and she doesnt work here anymore    i really wish i could turn back time i dont think there exist another person like her
  she was probably taken like 99 of decent girls
  that head to body ratio uuugh
    rebis
  thats just rinko and china i know sei probably grows up to look 95 like rinko but still
    at this point im fine with just friendly terms i already accepted that i wont start a family but it took me a lot of time to develop basic communication skills and i just wanted somebody friendly to talk with    i know that nobody will want lonely 28 years old without any social experience
  someone already did that
  i mean by virtue of her being a married woman its gonna come off as ntr if shes fucking anyone but her husband who had very little presence in the show
  tfw never even finished it  i really should i i have like 7 episodes left
    wrong and wrong
  sauce
  sei really does look like his mom
  read that book a bit more closely
  fmp fumoffu part where boys have a pick up girls challenge
  thats why hes so dangerously cute
  and nothing like his dad    could it mean
  rinko reproduces by budding
  id like to butt with rinko
    no doujin showing her impregnation on arian
  its like france where the entire court gets to watch their first time
i just payed 10 bucks for mega like a fucking chum    anyone got some good godzilla shit i can download from there i want to make the most of it
yutaka izubuchi needs to draw more manga holy shit
      too bad itll never happen and its a shame too this could have been to fantasy mecca what fss was to space opera mecha
  i love how its like the ultimate evolution of his galient ova designs how come nobody has ever talked about this on /m/
  because izu stopped working on it before it could be truly popular and when news came up he may continue it it was a no show and simply was a reprint of the volumes made
  why did he stop this shit deserves at the very least to get an ova like dragons heaven
  i cant remember why exactly as the info is in moon runes but it was either due to health/personal issues doing other work and then just lost interest and procrastinated it
  oh the humanity
  what is this rune masquer it gets brought up once in a blue moon
  there just needs to be more fantasy mecha in general i feel like i can count all the fantasy mecha series on one hand
bump because this is super interesting
  not that anon but ive never seen it until today
  rayearth escaflowne dunbine galient yamato takeru knights  magic god mazinger wataru ryuu knight musashi lord rpg densetsu hepoi wait how many fingers are on a hand again
  was knights  magic any good
  if you just want to see some robot action and genki shota its fine if you want some plot to go along with it read the manga or novels the anime was a pretty rushed adaption
  why is that sazabi using a bow
  ryu knight  mecha
  you forgot broken blade/break blade
  there needs to be more mecha manga in general
  there needs to be more good mecha manga in general  ftfy
someone refresh my memory did klimton actually say this or is it an edit    also whats the context
  episode
    its towards the end of episode 3 and he does say it
    context is that he is a genius but made a horrible mistake
  whats the context  he tried to take on some catsith 4 on 1
yes he does  context is that hes a spoiled rich kid and everyone calls him a prodigy/genius but hes kind of a fucking idiot and the site is juxtaposing his view of himself vs reality
  hes a spoiled rich kid  so hes garma
  klim charges a capital army base alone to rescue aida and blows out a bunch of shitters but then a nonshitter pilot dellensen manages to get the drop on him and scores some hits causing klim to freak a little    actually every single time klim tries to fight dellensen he gets btfo
i didnt understand klims behavior at the end of the show  yeah just fucking run the ship into my father and kill him fuck that guy    was there really not a single person on the ship who had qualms about casual murder and yeah i think i remember it showing zucchini diving out of the way but i cannot see him surviving the debris from something like that
  t char
  its not an edit but its not quite as funny in context posting the images together gives the impression that he has a sudden change in composure when the two reactions are pretty spaced out     you can tell by the way its cut here
the right more like the wrong
  no its a quote somebody just made up for no reason who would post an image macro of something a character actually said
  the actual dialogue in that episode is even better
  klim was a genius though
      i fucking love mcgillis so much
  i fucking love the name mcgillis who even comes up with these names
  klim realized at the final battle that his dad sent him off on a wild goose chase as a distraction for the other factions meanwhile ameria was sending a second secret fleet to take over capital tower to monopolize the photon batteries for their war against gondawa or w/e the unseen nation is then at the end klim sees his dad using klims death as propaganda to reignite the war effort and gets pissed that his dad was using him as a propaganda tool
  is ameria a subtle reference to america
  reminder none of those grunts could even touch mcgillis despite outnumbering him by the thousands he is effectively correct in his assessment
  what makes you say that bael was weaker than fucking barbatos and had nothing special going for him
  what makes you say that  watching the episode in question makes me say that unlike barbatos which gets trashed every other episode bael suffered no damage at any point except the one time it did thanks to mcgillis superior skill
  he jobbed hard the moment he got to fight another ms with an allelujah vagina system installed and with more than two weapons in their armament
  be that as it may the troops were still utterly powerless against him
  probably much like inglesa in turn a gundam is a reference to england
  
  hes also best boy and the most entertaining character to follow imo
  see you space chuuni
why did a thread about greco turn into a thread about ibo
  literally light yagami of gundam without the normal upbringing     as a former lightfag it hurts      to be honest i never felt like a genius but more like a lucky gambler while playing xcom
  mcgillis is the more entertaining character    laughing at him is entertaining      while true he was wrong to assess that the troops pulling back was due to his power as viewers we know the context enough to know that mcgillis is just getting high on power
  i love how his surnames a given name and his given names a surname  lastname firstname
        how was ibo even a real thing that happened
    i unironically liked the nobody else actually cares about bael twist
  it does have some parallel in real life there are many people who endlessly debate the us constitution noticing the many agencies and actions by the government that cant be constitutionally justified but although they notice this they think that if only they yell about the constitution more someone will listen none of them will come to the conclusion that no one cares about the constitution that what matters is the people who accrue power who get to do whatever they like as long as other people with power dont check them
  ghallarhorns and rustals tactics themselves are reminiscent of cointelpro
    the originalists who come to power rarely use originalist readings of the constitution across the board to determine what they want and more often just use it to support or justify positions or arguments theyve taken which is basically how people think anyway so its no real surprise
  i have seen many people and mcgillis fareed is one of them
  same
  hes not an idiot that was the mistake mask made when he thought that no one who called themselves a genius is a genius he was wrong to think that klim was therefore stupid and underestimate him in the end klim was a man of at least average intelligence
  nobody else actually cares about bael  watch it again  or dont because it sucks
  alright  nobody cares enough about bael to actually join him they just stand about wringing their hands   that better
what i took from muh bael is that the seven families recognized its power but they only went as far as to stay neutral and did not actively help whoever had activated bael    mcgillis plan was dumb as fuck from the beginning
  also theres like three frames of his father rolling out of the way into a dust cloud so its not even confirmed hes dead
  yeah but can you really imagine him surviving that
  and did not actively help whoever had activated bael  no its because mcgillis was a tard and didnt kill gaelio so gaelio and rustal revealed that mcgillis was conspiring against gjallarhorn and attempted to assassinate one of the heirs to the seven stars in order to steal power from 2 families despite that the elders still said if mcgillis beat rustal they would recognize his authority it shows that mcgillis was 100 right about bael but fucked up by delegitimizing himself as a traitor
  looks like the montero can spin super quick in episode 3
  anyone ever figure out why noredo wore a yarmulke
  jewism
  sauce me up senpai
    currentyear  doesnt know about goblin slayer    she dies in the first episode
    its not an edit but its not nearly that quick in the actual episode the oh no is like two minutes later when he takes a hit the image gives you the impression he declared his genius and then instantly failed
    he really is a genius in terms of piloting skills remember the genius term in japanese doesnt always mean intelligence wise     he just buys into his own hype so much he makes careless mistakes
  who else immediately figured out the scheme of the towasangans and dorette fleet klim was a genius youre all blind
  no its because mcgillis was a tard and didnt kill gaelio    or not even that if hed just kept his mouth shut and left the mask one then all gaelio would have known is some 3rd party guy from the montag company showed up to help tekkadan at the end and wouldnt have any dirt on mcgillis
bwah
  he lost because he let a loli stab his good gundamin hand
i still think the best description of what mcgillis did wrong was posted here right after the finale his entire plan essentially hinged on a legend he heard as a desperate child convinced that if his end game was to secure bael then hed be granted the rest of the power easily except everyone else in gjallahorn is like were fucking adults we cant just hand power over to you because you basically stole the personal gundam of our founder from centuries ago    this is reinforced by the fact its the younger officers who were part of his coup forces and they start to panic and bullshit when the bael plan doesnt work talking about special rules that the likes of tekkadan wouldnt understand
    he does but the scenes arent actually in sequence they are in the same episode though its great though because it perfectly encapsules klim nicks personality
    well he actually is at least the third most skilled pilot in the series if not the most skilled as hes a low tier god as far as mechas goes
  clapping amerians can still accurately be referred to as americlaps
    klimtons cute he deserves a boyfriend
  such as me
  nice try but i doubt you can beat mick jagger or whatever her name was
  none can beat mick jagger
  new england
  why do you post images with bot captions
  klim was actually pretty clever
klim is such a genius that everyone simply accepts this fact and moves the discussion to mcgillis instead  as expected of a genius
good ol klim
id vote for klimton sounds like the name of a great president
why
    no fucking shit gorillas are 400 pounds of pure muscle
  nicchini zucchini was the name of the actual president and thats a great name
  nicchini zucchini  sounds like some variation of the ravioli loli rhyme like nicchini zucchini im slurping on that little weenie
  how interesting that slurping on little weenies is the first example you think of why dont you have a seat over there
madman
you already got your answer why do you keep bumping this thread
  why do you keep bumping this thread
inquiring minds wish to know
  cute hat on a cute girl zun was probably involved with this somehow
    why do you keeping bumping the bump of the bump of the thread
  because i knew that you knew that i knew that you knew that i knew you would cheat
we will never experience comfy fun times in the regild century again  well never discuss the show and have a laugh and notice cool things like we did in the generals while the episodes aired  hold me broconguistas
  i actually found it hard to enjoy the generals of this show because there was always some retard insisting that the show didnt make sense and that it sucked and was the worst thing ever and that tomino is incompetent while there were always smart people there to explain the show i eventually got fed up and just started exclusively discussing it with a single friend so that was nice but now hes gone so i havent watched any new gundam show since then
    klim thinks hes a genius but hes actually a fuck up thats the context like people have said though the two scenes didnt happen concurrently
  he fucks up but he still remains a genius most of the time
klim talks the talk does he walk the walk
  there were definitely people just trying to stamp out all discussion with their shitposting but when they got bored and left and it quietened down there were some good times    you only missed out on ibo and the build fighters sequels so nothing
  he  i thought that was a girl ive been bamboozled by tomino
  really the male voice didnt give it away maybe try watching the show
  does he walk the walk  he fucking dunks on the git shitters with a mobile suit they built and he only has like 10 minutes of experience piloting
  what a badass
  you can still find him sometimes attack discussion
yes town
who hyped for the 57 films we got in the works cant wait for next year
  57 films  
it would have been funny if lelouch or one of the other tactician characters called in out in srw x but it was not to be to be fair lelouch is also a character who isnt as smart as he thinks he is
  klim does have a princessesque personality that would be great on a girl
hm
        autism
  gather your armies and meet me in the icy continent of northrend
wah
some folks have way too much free time on their hands
  sure but it happened close enough which is why its unintentionally hilarious
  thats a load of crap
  the madman
klim is cool
  the retards dropped it pretty quick a few episodes in the threads were really fun when it was filled with mostly people with 3 digit iq
  i dunno i specifically remember people having no idea why ringo joined up with bellris gang and that was over halfway through
ringo is cool
  raymond amuro  noah bright  abraham soran  fareed mcgillis
    the point of principle is to guide action not restrict it absolutely anyway youre supposed to look at the rules you set down really consider if this is truly an occasion worthy of breaking them and then 99 times out of 100 not break the rules but unyielding and resolute loyalty to words is how you grind people beneath the wheel of systems and process and no one really wants to be the guy to say i was just following orders    of course if you keep breaking your rules maybe you need to rewrite your rules or reassess your rulebreaking
    oh shit theres another one   reguild era names are corrupted ad names  klimton  clinton  nick clinton
  also nute gunray is named after newt nute gingrich and ronald reagan gunray  raygun  reagan
  reminder that mquve was probably named after macbeth    マクベ mquve  マクベス macbeth
klim nick  full name is klimton nicchini  his dads name is zuchini  most kino uc naming
  blocks your path
  burnings kino but cant top a useless side character named after a vegetable
  incompetent president  stupid name  named after a vegetable  carrot is also a vegetable  carrots are orange  do you think he was based on donald trump
huh
  faggot
  huh
  donald is not a vegetable name
  hes also never eaten a vegetable in his life
  hey  ketchup has tomatoes in it  well done and smothered
  nothing beats jamaican daninghan his name sounds like they had a couple of daninghans hanging around and they needed a way to tell them apart    of like a knockoff cuban pete
  because he wanted the chocolate
  gimme the chocolate hisao
  always amusing how theres plenty of japanese people who have no trouble coming up with normal sounding names and then theres tomino who looks like he just alternates between picking random words out of the dictionary and smacking his fist into a typewriter because hes so old that keyboards didnt exist in his day
  but bring stabbity is fine
  i didnt say all names were normal sounding just that theres a lot of anime names that are much more normal than the ones tomino comes up with    bring stabbity is an excellent name though and if i played world of warcraft i would make a rogue with that name
  yikes
  theyre like 15 years behind the curve
sub or dub
normalfags are going to watch eva now
asuka or rei
  eva dub rocked    t subtitle elitist
  oh no now evangelion wont be an obscure underground indie title anymore
  this is going to be amazing
  now    normies have been watching eva since forever
  hikari
not surprised it took the netflix dumptruck of cash to finally brought it back
  theyll have both
  eva dub sucked    t filthy dubfag
i hope we get a blu ray release out of this
  im surprised funi hasnt forked over the cash for it yet
guess ill ask here is it better to start mecha with eva or am i better off watching something else
  start with what you want to start    i mean you could do a hell of a lot worse than hideaki annos depression selftherapy adventure but if you have to ask where to start youll never be in control of your /m/ destiny
  evas good and does have some good robot fights lots of people dont like that it isnt entirely about the robot fights though
  i dont wanna agree with him but there are levels to normalfags  i break it down like this    the general public  there are people who caught anime here and there along with saturday morning cartoons in their childhood  they generally dont care unless in brief moments of nostalgia    normalfags  there are people that get into anime ironically  those that genuinely like it but dont travel farther than shounen or the most popular currently airing shows or most talked about creators and animators in the industry due to memes and the way internet culture focuses on whats currentthis is like 80 of anime fans in the west and they mainly hang around youtube and twitter communities    seminormalfags  those that go a bit deeper and look at older stuff specific genres and classics    otaku  people who go farther than that and consume merchandise of various shows or just focus on onethis right here can apply to normalfags or otaku its sometimes hard to distinguish  people who become hyper autists and will research about the shows and the artists behind what they love out of passion or a desire to create their own work    reaching netflix is basically reaching the entire online population its an extremely popular platform
  you could but i wouldnt recommend it since its too unconventional in some areas    id start off with a post 2000s gundam or macross series  or just any post 2000s mecha series that has a decent amount of the cliches the genres known for    aquarion  full metal panic  macross frontier  gundam seed  gundam 00  gurren lagann  code geass  eureka seven    these are all pretty decent entry titles and watching a few of em could help ease you in
  shut up fag
how would you feel if netflix commissioned a new dub
  nothing  subfags wouldnt watch it anyways and dubfags would be upset at any major changes
  evas less of a mecha and more annos thesis on human interaction being kind of fucked it has some really good fights though def recommend
  big whoop they shouldve plugged in g gundam instead
    did evangelion air on toonami
  thats next week
  dub has some pretty questionable line delivery for a lot tho some characters fare better it also suffers from removed or changed sound effects that trademark eva 01 howl is edited out of episode 16 dub and changed in episode 19 end of evangelion also removes the mpe vocals and adds unusual splat noises i get that you dont like to read but please just avoid the dub
  yes  it had a very heavily censored two episode run during giant robot week in 2003    followed by a virtually uncut airing on adult swim a few years later    then 111 and 222 aired on the revived toonami a few years back    
  they had a giant robot week one time and the first one or two episodes of eva aired there heavily edited it later aired in its entirety on adult swim i think
  it would show promise i would also be curious to see the characters with new actors entirely
  ehhhhhhhhh  on one hand i dont particularly like the eva dub as it is but on the other spike spencer and crew are way too ingrained in my mind
  for a moment i panicked from the fearful thought that netflix was making a live action adaptation life shouldnt be this horrible
  why are they using the og shuffle alliances 7th fight suits for the discs
  its bad but this and other current events are uplifting
  oh boy people are so gonna be exposed to the messed up mindfuckery of this
  tequila gundam shot glass  shuffle alliance patches  i didnt know this existed or how bad i needed this
  its gonna be great love seeing friends reactions now more people are gonna see this insanity i mostly want them to see eoe its been very non accessible to them since you need to see the whole tv series either bought or pirated for the background more will be exposed
  its much better once youve seen a few mecha so you can identify what eva does differently
  evangelion has become more obscure since we havent gotten a normal dvd/bluray release in almost a decade the platinum collection is going for 250 dollars    the only modern exposure to evangelion are the movies which might as well not even exist anymore since they are incomplete and strictly inferior to the original    we have gone pretty much into the territory that if an anime more than 5 years old it is no longer mainstream
  it is the only mecha series normalfag see  even to this day i keep seeing pacrim being compared to eva
  rip /m/      now
  this this is the hope evangelion hits netflix  people ask funimation whats the dealio why no blureis  funimation strikes when the irons hot/gets the hint/begs japan    i already made the blurei joke
its going to be a shitty upscale smeared with filters and im going to laugh
  why would they do that instead of just airing the bluray versions im pretty sure the news even says its bluray quality and theres already a bluray available
  funimation strikes when the iron is hot  how many fucking years did it take funimation to actually release evangelion 333 on bluray after its release in japan anon funimation dosent give a shit evangelion sells like fucking water in japan and all funimation cares about is butchering another re re re re re release of dragon ball gt because that is the one that made so much money d
lmao what made khara/gainax give in   i thought they were going to wait until they released the last film
  lmao what made khara/gainax give in
  misato
  by god i would have slaughtered them if it were not laws of this land
  that was because they fucked the dub up and gas to rerecord everything though
  evangelion sells like fucking water    is that good im not familiar with this idiom
  yall ready for best girls return
  lain eva and the occasional seasonal trigger show are the only anime that twitterreading /mu/browsing vaporwavelistening avantnormies ever watch
  thats just not true
  eva threads will be even worse now  grrrrrreeeeeeaaaatttt
  like what its a love letter to the stuff anno likes it does very little new
  now  what
  the only mecha normalfags watch are eva ttgl geass and darling in the franxx
  the quality in the trailer is pretty good seems on par or slightly better than sephirotic releasebd rip with no madvr enhancement
  he doesnt know
  cursed pronunciation
  now
    to be fair something like a netflix series if it wasnt you know shit would actually be a much better medium to try and do a live action eva than the movie hollywood claims they are going to make every few years     eva doesnt really lend itself to a movie format even the rebuilds showed this if you restrict the runtime you force yourself to cut out the material that makes the story worth watching in the first place
  i seriously dont get why this is newsworthy and people are spamming it left and right  no seriously
  neon genesis evangelion a netflix original
  i dont want a black asuka
  this  no anime live action there are no good ones why do we keep trying   we cant even trust them with power rangers
  you realize the blurays are intentionally kept artificially scarce so they can justify a 40000 yen price tag right it wont happen
  rei
  rei___
  rebuilds problems have nothing to do with the format
  except thats false since theres no shortage of supply and its available pretty much everywhere
  eva is so deep and complex    this meme died in 2003
  eva is shallow and simple    this meme died in 1997
  pen pen
  i want to impregnate and marry rei
  do you not know how netflix works    if you wanted you can have a french dub with spanish subtitles
  you must not be familar with ideon either since eva rips it off
  discussion about how there is no western release  dude theres no shortage of supply its available everywhere  imagine being this retarded imagine the only western release was a dvd set over 15 years ago it isnt hd and has since been discontinued
  show me a source that offers it for under 40k yen ill wait
  french dub with spanish subtitles  truly the patricians choice for anime viewing
  i seriously dont get why this is newsworthy and people are spamming it left and right  no seriously  theyre literal shills seriously
  literally half of that  
    because its a show that is super famous but actually really hard to get legally     the only version of a hard copy of the show worth having in the west is 300 and hasnt been in print for almost two decades and netflix is literally the first time it will have even been available for streaming    so people are mostly excited to be able to watch it at all and kind of have their fingers crossed that the netflix version will be bluray quality which would very much be something worth being excited about the blurays for nge only exist in japan have no english subs/dub and sell for 600 despite being much more recent than the previously mentioned dvds because reasons
  khara is the one who gave it to netflix and theyre no doubt giving them the bd source the same way they gave it to the japanese broadcasters and streaming services in the years since the bd box was released
  dude its only 200 for an anime  well ill concede you found a lower price although im not sure if it just went down over time or if thats some outlier its still retarded high as it is point remains theres no western release because if it did exist the price would plummet since nips could just import it
    not just pirating it  the sephirotic release is miles better
thank god for this ive put off watching the show for a few years now cause i wanted an official bluray release to see nge in the most perfect way possible
  does it have english subs
  streaming  perfect
  its the next best thing ill obviously still support a bd release if it came out
  my distinguished colleague from the city
  misato  dub raspy but cute voice great at shouting orders commanding yet with also a sense of vulnerability decent crying performance good for comedic lines  sub basic japanese female voice sensitive and yielding  rei  dub amanda winn lee can do a higherpitched breathy voice but also has a deeper sound from deep in her throat giving her performance more depth and feeling  sub generic little girl voice 7623  asuka  dub fantastic performance from tiffany grant who genuinely loves the character cartoonish sounding and overthetop at times but also expressive and emotive when she needs to be  sub super highpitched shrill annoying girl voice that does not sound realistic at all and makes your ears bleed  shinji  dub really corny and cartoonish but gets better over time about halfway through the show the character has alot of emotive scenes that are at least adequately performed  sub a voice so weak and frail that it sounds feminine most of the time especially when screaming  ritsuko  dub strong and powerful voice of a smart scientist woman with a successful career in a position of leadership a bold performance that matches her smartass kinda bitchy personality  sub softspoken and low voice lacking confidence and pride  gendo  dub cold and distant but with an intelligent and cunning sound like he has something to hide  sub generic deep male voice 5  for a great comparison of gendos voice compare the sub to the dub of the cemetery scene in episode 15    also adv got creative with many different vocal effects in some of the more abstract scenes and it adds a lot to the atmosphere of the show for a great example compare the scene of reis introspection in episode 14 in the dub for that scene they added some effects to her voice that contributes more to the mood of that scene than what they did in the original which was nothing
  dub
  die normalfags
  i can honestly imagine kamille saying this
  all of your subjective voice bullshit is invalidated by the objectively shit delivery 90 of the dub has
  i am autistic enough to unironically agree with him
  shineeeee  futsuujin yatsura me
  sub basic japanese female voice sensitive and yielding  get fucked nigger
  if its been discontinued then the original rights holders get zero money from second hand sales so why would they artificially keep it scarce      dvd / blu ray box sets in japan are not expected to be sold to the average consumer only rental stores and hardcore otaku actually buy them everyone else catches reruns on tv or rents them
  no dude thats just how much blu rays cost in japan the only reason they wouldnt release a blu ray in america is so that the japanese dont import the cheaper american blu ray
  im glad that its the case but its weird that the us and japan are the same region with blurays since this has always been an issue
  doesnt excuse the godawful line delivery in the dub
   dude thats just how much blu rays cost in japan    really doesnt look it almost 10x the norm here
  it really varies it seems    90 in the us    130 in japan    eva is over 2x as much on amazon
  im sure you really appreciate all the nuances of moonspeak while youre trying to read the subtitles
  based  he must hate asuka
  
how come all people who champion asuka are basically braindead    what do people see in a broken doll like asuka anyway  oh bo hooo she so sad  well she better fucking get in line then this anime is made out of sad people even the director is fucked up
  people like the firebrand over the submissive doll    i know shes not a doll
  firebrand  thats a meme asuka is a a literal puppet
    imagine being so out of touch with reality that you think evangelion is obscure
    it did im no elitist but i just dont find dubs natural or enjoyable but at least eoe was pretty good     embed  then 111 and 222 aired on the revived toonami a few years back    the 2013if i remember correctly movie airings on revived toonami got me in to eva i miss being an edgy kid watching le deep anime
  not to defend the idea that its obscure but in reality eva has been all but inaccessible to the mainstream for nearly a decade at a time where anime has become hyper accessible that even popular things falls out of the spotlight faster than ever even rebuild suffers from that since the last one was six years ago    netflix is legitimately going to introduce it to a whole lot of people who have never experienced it before
  dont forget grant is the only one who did the german scene well      /pol/ppet detected you must go back
  on top of being fluent in german nonetheless
  makes me glad i bought my platinum for 20 bucks
  evas definitely not obscure but if you honestly think that anyone besides the more hardcore communities like this and the type of avantnormies that  was talking about have actually watched any of eva and dont just regurgitate get in the robot shinji and other classic memes then i think youre the one whos more out of touch
  this post again
  the voice casting isnt really the problem with the eva dub though you could still take issue with it its the poor line delivery that takes far too long to reach an acceptable level and the needless creative liberties taken with the script that reaches a boiling point in the two movies i certainly enjoy a lot of early adv dubs the nadia dub being excellent is the hill i will die on but they just werent equipped to tackle evangelion at that point  the rebuild dubs are far better but the movies themselves are total shit so it doesnt even matter
  people who still listen to vaporwave are more educated about anime than you seedfag
  buuuuulllshit    but they have watched it you actually need to be a normie to find eva interesting typically a late teens / early 20s sadboy
  the rebuild dubs were trash when they decided to recast rei kaiji gendo and ritsuko
  i bet you try your best at school when the other kids run circles around your weak arguments nice try but i think its time for bed kiddo
  platinum was one of the first things i ever torrented
imagine  netflix comissions a new dub  spike spencer tiffany grant and amanda winn lee returns  alongside misatos ritsukos and gendos the good one vas  imagine  imagine
  not being literally emotionally invincible makes you a puppet  asuka copes far better than many would in her position
  many being no one
  500 for all of gundam unicorn 150 for one quarter of gundam seed just about the only ones that are reasonably priced are the ones which say import which means theyre from america
  gendos the good one vas  you better be talking about macavery
  anno saw the money trucks netflix came with and couldnt resist
    which version to use theres the directors cut then the recent hd remaster
  it will be the hd obviously
you people should check the latin american dub they gave asuka the same retarded accent that english make when they wanna mock germans is fucking hilarious
    alright though if it will be hd how different would is it from the directors cut
  bluray doesnt have any changes or edits its just a straight audio and visual quality upgrade of the directors cut     except episode 16 of course
  christmas is coming  yet this exists    dont tempt me
eva coming to netflix  new generation of people that wont respect jet alone and think hes stupid
    i swear that shot glass alone is making my mouth water
evangelion  current year  honestly who really cares
no original cut of death  no rebirth at all  nice job netflix
    guys is there any way my nonrune reading ass could get an answer on this
  i agree with these especially gendo his dub is god tier
    no
  my negroe
  rei by a longshot
  asuka
  youre stretching it with the shinji assessment   dub shinji is bad its not even totally his fault i read an interview somewhere about the ghetto recording booths where they admitted they couldnt get too loud or emotive or the reverb would mess up the audio  jap shinjis screams are bloodcurdling and visceral get your ears and/or heart checked
    uh i meant to quote this guy
   rei having the presence of self to pick out and wear casual clothes instead of always wearing her school uniform because its good enough    what a weird image
  more importantly when are we getting pic related oh wait here it is    
  of course i am nothing against john swasey but macavery really made gendo his own
  just accept it already it anon the jet alone is kinda dumb
it would be nice to have the original tv series redrawn in 169
  netflix is legitimately going to introduce it to a whole lot of people who have never experienced it before  fine by me if evangelion goes from being mildly popular to popular i see nothing to be upset about
  no it wouldnt the composition is perfect as it is also thats basically just 111 the bigger question is whether or not netflix is going to default evangelion to be 169 because normalfags cant handle black bars
    episode 7 is still way better than magma diver
  magma diver  bad  pleb
  you might want to consider that  what if this spins up enough interest to order a new set of evangelion movies   rerebuild evangelio 111 extra sparkling electric boogaloo  its even a bigger clusterfuck than 30
  why would they do that the trailer is with original ar too
  asuka
  the only time ive ever seen them do that is with inuyasha my sister watches it not me i swear which is stretched to 169 everything else ive seen is the correct aspect ratio
  i dont think theyll do that since the bluray version of the series preserves the aspect ratio the only reason i could see them doing it is if the bluray releases themselves are cut down like with dbz ive watched plenty of 43 content on netflix before
  just another reason to make prime canon
  at least magma diver has an original plot at least i havent heard anything about it ripping off something
  the only correct answer
  i see logh berserk that dude who hints spirits mushishi and kaworuwhat else is in there is the left one the girl from 8th ms
  wtf is bottom left
    jet alone
  this man knows whats up
  drawing lines between which episodes rip off what is retarded just admit that the whole show rips off gundam and ideon and various western sci fi movies and that its still good
  damn fine answer
  correct
  various western sci fi movies  tv shows more like and movies as well of course
  episode 13 is the andromeda strain 25/26 and eoe borrow imagery from 2001 a space odyssey and stalker what else is there
  gendo
  there is only one best girl and neither of those are it
  shinji is too lewd for 4channel
  may be a crap shoot theres plenty of shows with black bars iirc most of the treks preserve there aspect ratio the ones without bd releases at least maybe even those ones do to its been a year or two
  ufo
    amanda confirms new dub and that she wont be back  if its like the rebuild dub then shinji asuka and misato will be the same likely with better performances as theyve improved over the years
  amanda confirms new dub and that she wont be back    god bless netflix
  bit of a shame but its no big loss rei is very soft spoken so the difference in voice shouldnt be too noticeable
    and it looks like spike wasnt even asked prepare for an all new dub then i guess
        next level
    i cant say i blame them its a smart move     while the dub voices are iconic there are some pretty shaky dubs in that lineup that dont stand up after time kensuke cough cough and they can theoretically use the new dub as an opportunity to clear up some shit that was a little too vague in the original like gendo fusing with adam or reis status as a clone of shinji mom which you wouldnt think needs to be spelled out explicitly but since some people are still in denial of that particular plot point    on top of that a new dub is likely to get people that have already seen eva before to check out the new showing of it if nothing else than to check out the new dub work    as long as they have bluray quality visuals we are still winning out worst case scenario some dedicated fanboy just replaces the audio track with the old dub and we are back in business
  shinji dub voice  ugh no get someone else to do it
    could be neat if they actually put the money and effort into making it really good netflixs other english dubs are typically pretty okay but evas a bit of a different beast and they know it and if they fuck it up well i was planning on watching it subbed anyways
  not liking spike spencer  but why anon
  some people in this world actually have standards
  i liked spike spencer in nier and buso renkin where he played very different characters from shinji
i am not looking forward to more newfags than ever parroting the deconstruction meme someone needs to make a mecha handbook asap
  never post this image again please      ritsuko
  one with gerry anderson in it
  new dub  well i guess i have an excuse to rewatch nge again
  they are all clones of the batman and robin of 90s gundam
cant wait for neflix to replace all the old vas with black people
  the original dub already did this with makotos character in eoe
rei vs asuka threads are going to be a thing again
glad were getting a new dub that old english version was awful spike spencer and tiffany grant especially
  watching it again and pic related
  choosing between two fucked up whores   no thanks
  choosing lesbian  ishygddt
  new updated show so i i can stop fapping to a 14 years old when
  netflix  skips the credit and goes to the next episode    some people are going to watch evangelion without ever listening to jikai yokoku wtf    
not ritsuko  grow some fucking tasteanon
  based maya is the best
  the last two pics from the set are not allowed on christian image boards
  mods dont exists now post the tits
  it is a far far better thing that i do than i have ever done it is a far far better rest that i go to than i have ever known            
  ritsuko was cuter with her original hair color imo too bad practically no fanart exists
  tatami galaxy its good
        
  lashing out at people is not coping anon
  thats child play  i cant post my next level because its forbidden here
  ill always wonder what would have happened if evangelion went with the original plan of making asuka the protagonist i doubt it would have become the worldchanger that it did because otaku cant project into a female character but it probably would have still been amazing    maybe the inevitable liveaction adaptation can go this route if they want to change things up plus it would solve the problem of needing a white lead for western audiences
  not wanting to be lesbians with a cute girl  what are you gay
  i never asked for this
  evangelion is coming to netflix  evangaylion is probably the most overrated anime in history
  i doubt it would have become the worldchanger that it did because otaku cant project into a female character  i call bullshit  mecha is one of the genre that support female main character the most and there a whole recipe based around frail little girl achieving or displaying determination and power through /m/echanical means  otaku accept very well to have excuse to have a cute girl on screen all the time and not bother with any male character    this is particularly the case for evangelion by the way i give full credit to the idea that shinji asuka and rei were created by genderbending the typical superrobot cast and making the insecure shrinking violet into the main character instead of the boastful unstoppable hero
  itd probably have less to do with le ebil muhsoggykneeistic webz and more with the fact that evangelion would have fucking asuka emotional abuse sohryu as the main character
  sumire
  top right texhnolyze bottom right darker than black
  ive seen like one and i agree its a shame
  did gendo start fucking her immediately after her mom died
    maybe not having sex in specific but i think its safe to assume that he started laying the emotional groundwork for manipulating her not long after her mom died he needed to keep an expert on the magi system as his ace in the hole in his shadow war with seele without ritsukos mom ritsuko was his best shot     he couldnt risk her not being emotionally dependent on him even if the actual consummation of that relationship didnt happen for years
  top row lain logh texhnolyze  second row flcl berserk mushishi  bottom row tatami galaxy eva nhk
    well now im curious
  i think you need to watch this show again because it seems you didnt notice that the original series had multiple main characters that get scenes dedicated to their perspective after their debut
    a lot of characters get added depth and exploration but the story is undeniably shinjis story not just because he is the viewpoint character but because the arc of the narrative and even the problems afflicting the other characters are all reflections and foils to his own personal crises you cant just swap a different character into shinjis spot and keep everything else the same to call it a day the themes and story are all keyed for him specifically    change who the mc is and the rest of the story has to shift to reflect that even asuka who is in many ways the most similar to shini in terms of the nature of her dilemma would demand a very different story to explore her and how she deals with her issues
  if it was shinjis story why is backstory kept in the background until much later plus there are many episodes that barely involve him at all not to mention everything the audience knows way in advance before shinji even has any hint of knowing we see seele on like the second episode meanwhile shinji never even knows about them until after leliel
    because its not first person limited i cant think of many shows that are its generally not a point of view that tv or movies do
  how is misato who gets equal amounts of screen time and development as shinji who also gets more inner monologues than he does not share the main character role with him
  because she doesnt pilot the main robot  pilot main robot  main character
  someone on 4chan with taste shit never thought i would see the day
  this image isnt parodying the average normalfag though
  but nobody else can ball like jet alone
  right japan does this shit alot and it makes zero sense with her character
  so yui ikari is the main character i mean technically when unit 01 goes beserk shes piloting not shinji
    we aint dead sorry about only a mangadex link today i dont have time and tl is in japan he is usually the dumper next chapter will be a bit delayed too because he is gonna still be in japan for a bit
nice to see best boy again and also that hes got his ride i love how nonchalant hes being here about showing up riding an alien even if this sort of thing is pretty normal to both of them by now
  oh hey its been a while glad this project isnt dead
also in good news sadamitsu was finally released digitally so well be able to get rid of these cursed chinese scans of the physical release soon    image related digital version of volume 2s cover compare to the op image which is our current scans
  nice
i dont know if this will be useful for any future threads but it should be
japan is great  im drunk  next chapter sometime this decade    im literally chilling out where sadamitsu is set no aliens or cute girls tho    thanks for reading 3
  thanks for the release
  next chapter sometime this decade  ill take it
    the three or so of us who actually follow this are grateful
    oh hey this is still a thing nice
  make that four merci
wait shit is this the series that people would bandwagon to record a played it of the op of a few years back specifically on that double deck electric piano/organ thing
    its the one with mariachi
  
    yep thats exactly what i was thinking of even a school band played it
  i never get sick of this op
im not allowing this thread to die in the sunday spam
  were stronger than that
  good man
  even a school band played it    okay i got to see that
    shes top tier
  is that ahoge even legal
obey my ordersor else
kamjin the allykiller
i think hed kill you even if you followed orders hes an equal opportunity employer
  he did multiple times hes that much of an asshole
    fuck you im going to make love to their best warrior
what was khyrons problem
  i dont know he seems chilled in his first appearance especially when him and that dude betted on how many ships they would hit from teleportation after that and more missions he got really impatient and hates the micronians though how that factor to him going apeshit on his men is beyond me
universal century has been shit much longer than its been good and at this point only retarded brown third worlders like it
youre on a roll today huh
  you probably think im the guy who made this thread  but i bet hes also a retarded brown third worlder
only unicorn and twilight axis are really outright bad the rest have at least a couple interesting things going even if its overall kind of mediocre like 08th ms team or ms igloo
  careful not to snap those delicate wrists with all that shitposting doughboy
  those two are just a natural evolution of a repetition thats been plaguing uc since as far back as the last third of zeta that was the point where gundam shifted focus from a new generation dealing with new enemies to the old enemy of the old generation coming back to do the same shit they did last time then we got 0080 which opened the floodgates for all those sidestories dedicated to reliving the same conflict over and over and over again even when tomino tried to move forward with late uc the damage was already done and uc was doomed to be pandering forever ucs target audience since then has been shitslurping paypigs whose only measure of quality is familiarity
  gundam has been shit much longer than its been good and at this point only retarded brown third worlders like it  fixed
i dont get why you are all getting this worked up about your chinese robot cartoons for childeren they were never works of art to begin with just somethign fun to watch
    i think the newtype wankery getting more and more central to the plot and overpowered is what hurts the uc other than that its still better overall compared to nonuc entries
  anyone who disagree with me stupid from other place
    retarded brown third worlders    but anon thats most of /m/ now
  the truth is  gundam never been good
i really enjoy it i dont think its perfect but i think its an interesting setting with lots of cool factions at play gundam unicorn was poorly written but i still found it enjoyable im excited to see where they take the newtype stuff too im kinda hoping they connect it to ideon explicitly the idea that the psychoframe is tapping into the domain of god by manifesting will is also really interesting to me i also like how every uc oav/movie has its own distinct directorial and art style even nt looks and feels different than unicorn which its basically a direct sequel to makes it feel more exciting to me than shared universes like marvel and dc which put a lot of effort into visual and tonal consistency across works im not enjoying all the ghost stuff and pacifism stuff    also im so excited for hathaways flash thats always the gundam project i wanted animated most of all if they do a turn a prequel then theres literally nothing more i want from this franchise and ill be eternally satisfied with it well i woulda also love a looking for avenir film or really anything exploring preuc but i know thats basically impossible crossbone would also be fine i guess i dunno i kinda hate crossbone and its style both narratively and artistically but i also know a ton of people love it and if it getting an adaptation would make those folks happy then yeah    also i liked the last jedi i watched it on shrooms and it became this jungian nightmare between good and evil anima and animus heaven and hell mysticism and materialism solidity and fluidity shit was intense    basically stop taking this stuff so seriously if you dont like it dont watch
  do you need help son
its hanukkah     post jewish /m/    super dimensional messiah z op      kuroi daiyoroi op  
  so basically this is a balmar thread
granzort even sounds like a kike name    
israeli engineering at its finest
a kyoshin attacking what seems to be haifa of all places
lookin damn fine there remy
  hes constantly thinking about ways to make money  kek
  when youre old enough to start thinking about the actual shit hanukkah celebrates besides the oil miracle and all the fried food rationalized by it    so real talk the maccabees were kinda fundamentalist assholes    on the flipside maccabee is a fucking badass name since it can be read to mean as the hammer at the very least if im not mangling my sandrunes the root word mcb refers to hammers or some shit i think
  they could just develop a space colony or moonland and make israel there unless muh heritage
  googling hanukkah right now changes the web background
  literally emperor zero
  sauce plox
  i think its from patlabor dont know which episode though
how was ms gundam narrative
  that colony drop scene  i hate zeon even more
man i love the narratives design an unfinished frame with left over shit slapped on it feels like such a rushed solution
  jesus christ how many drops are we at
  nah the sydney drop it really pointed out the devastating effect even more we can see as the back of the colony slowly hurling it self towards sydney thousand of people are still trying to escape only to be caught in the blast
  banana and mineva laplace intervention give legitimate cause for colony independence       welp now we can actually blame those two for creating the whole mess during late uc
its the tlj of gundam
  what they have no hand in jovian madness those fuckers were crazy way before either of them were old enough to do anything they fucking sent scirocco to fuck shit up
  no they really push for spacenoids independence hence why during cosmo babylonia wars feds were lazy to send a response team but use economical pressure to force cb to declare bankruptcy and just took over control and this too led to the whole warring in space period where every colony is at each other throat and feds have zero control over how the colonies are govern and thus the uprising of zanscare who nearly wiped ou everyone on earth  thanks banana
  
  its an old one they just did streetlevel shots of the impact and people dying in it
  kek for truth
  that literally had nothing to do with laplaces box and everything to do with the federations own political irresponsibility economic decline and just general lack of concern for whats going on in space banagher and mineva letting the cat out of the box on an old conspiracy did nothing but make a bunch of feddie politicians cringe in fear and waste resources in dealing with the potential fallout    no they really push for spacenoids independence  no they dont
  political irresponsibility economic decline and just general lack of concern for whats going on in space  build up military to combat rouge spacenoid uprising  house military base to prevent rouge separatist movement  the feds are building up its military to bully the sovereign spacenoids nation  feds back down spend money on building destroyed infrastructure  spacenoid rebellion rise and took the newly build infrastructure for themselves  waa help us feds  why dont the feds help us  the feds only care for themselves  the feds come and help them and most of them who died are feds personnel  now can we rebuild our armed forces so such scenario wont happened again  no the feds are tyrant long live zeon    yeah if im the feds i just let them all burned out and die
          now all we have to wait for is to see how legendary fucks it up noticing a trend the last few years of making bigger explosions in film proof of creative bankruptcy     216 onward    
wiping aussies isnt all that bad
    hard to do though even this depiction is done wrong
  but sunrise hasnt made a mefia campaign where they claim anybody that didnt like it is a racist sexist russian bot though
  done wrong i dont see how
    that impact should leave nothing not one damn thing standing the charcoled buildings make no sense they at least got the vapor halo right
  i see it is true that in all other depictions it was shown as a watery hole or whatevers left of sydney and 30km radius still think its too big to just leave that kind of hole but the dropping scene was decent just that after effect was done like shit
  oh suuuure blame the jolly jovians blame the jupiter jiants not the corrupt federation not the zeon on the moon edition no blame the poor hardworking people who can barely ration oxygen
    much worse anon the impactor was the thickest part of the 3 parts that hit a disk 6 km in diam at that point only 35km long and moving at a 75 angle at 11km/s the hole is about 500 km wide this is where the bullshit starts and in another sorce supposed to be 4 km deep only a solid rock would be able to do that not something of metal and plastic the effect is always the show thoughpic related is best evidence for that
  i dont really understand why there is no need for 516749 depictions of colony drop either since it just seems that each author pushes their own fanfic numbers and they all contradict each other  here it seems to be worst at the par of colony drop on dublin where it at best looks like a stick stabbed into dublin at worst a turd lodged into city whereas it shouldve caused semi nuclear winter in europe wiped whole irish island and good deal of uk instead of just city wipe and a blip on horizon
now i understand why tomino was so mad about the nt colony drop scene i thought he was just being a old fart
  always thought that was weird colony drop on australia  almost human extinction colony drop on ireland  oh its fine well rebuild it next year
  thats the same interview where he screamed at and berated the interviewer boldly declaring that his 351 greco movies will be better than any other recent gundam series
  i have tried to quantify the drop in hard numbers before but the physics required goes far above my head i would have to take a lot of liberties and i dont feel i would do it justice i did however do a write up a year or so ago how with just a few grams of uranium material a mobile suit could effectively operate for somewhere around 15 days at full power consumption and continuous use i also was able to get real numbers for how strong the rx78s beam weapons must have bee i will have to see if i can find it
    visuals as bait anon blockbusters in film tend to try and ride on this to make up for shit stories and such jacksons upcoming mortal engines interpretation is a glory whore of an example of this
    and isnt it a damn laugh in the whole uc era we never see the other two impact hits the one near toronto and the other just south of hawaii
  is the unicorn era the new zeon wars era theres pretty much zero reasons to dive into that pointless mini conflict again
  this joke isnt funny anymore now that we know the films are happening he already let us know that if the first one doesnt do well then its going to stop there but that was before the first film got announced
    he knows it will bomb this really is a kinda torture for him
  i need that interview
      its just continuing ucs theme of assholes squandering the chance for peace
shit just like everything gundam made in the past 30 years
    if greco movie happens im preordering the bluray    anyway having watched the nt on gundaminfowas that like the first episode because it felt like it skipped all the characterization as if we already knew the characters involved considering gundam is a character drama series that does feel very stupid
  its the first 23 minutes of a movie
    so they do literally nothing to establish the main character in the movie    jesus what a trainwreck i thought they mightve skipped some parts to get to the action faster
  i got the impression that part of it might have assumed you read phoenix hunt and are familiar with the material narrative uses as a jump off point but it does have a bit of pacing whiplash    its possible the first 23 were shown since its a good vertical slice of what nt consists of and some proper exposition occurs in the middle act right after we have zoltan waltz in
     they fucking sent scirocco to fuck shit up    why are you posting headcanon like its fact
     no they really push for spacenoids independence    what they dont even lightly push for any such thing     hence why during cosmo babylonia wars feds were lazy to send a response team but use economical pressure to force cb to declare bankruptcy and just took over control and this too led to the whole warring in space period    oh you treat crossbones rubbish as relevant never mind i guess        what has any if that got to do with banagher or mineva
  i know what you mean but i think it uses a flashback structure throughout the film to get this stuff across maybe thats why one of the ship names is a citizen kane reference    every original gundam movie is badly paced and weirdly scripted tho fight me
  is there a camrip or something already  isnt the only way to see this film is to actually be in japan
  i interpreted it as buildings that were destroyed miles away
anything on a dvd/online release date    since i would rather not watch a camrip
    the basic problem is that we dont even know if the main character is an introvert or an extrovert    is he neurotic confident brash does he have a funny accent    theres blank slate mcs and then theres the mc that gets 23 minutes and somehow manages to reveal literally nothing about who he is
  ask again in 46 months
  why did they send beyblades to kill civilians on colonies
cams are highly unlikely until a nonjapanese showing    japanese laws about cams include criminal penalties of prison time longer than accidental manslaughter
  just wait until its out on china should be either this month or the next
is there any major incident sidestory more worthless than everything unicorn related was     even stardust memories for all the shit people gives to it managed to be small enough to not wonder why nobody mentions the delaz fleet incident later but relevant enough to give a little push to the whole creation of the titans
  meanwhile in sunrise hq    ah fuck this    lets just talk about the one year war
  nah 0083 is such a wet fart that you can excise it and not realize somethings missing    at least unicorn and narrative bother to give an idea as to how psycoframe disappeared before f91 rather than become a staple technology theres a legitimate plot hole about psycoframe existing and not being used further that cca leaves and f91 ignores
    zaaaaakuuuuus    jiiiiiiiims
  while unicorn reiterated a lot of concepts it could at least seen as some sort of summation of uc up until that point   this movie just retouches on ideas already explored as recent as unicorn itself which makes it seem pretty redundant its a bunch of ideas we already understood a bunch of tech we already saw in action and feats we already had a grasp of from the tail end of unicorn even the side stories that have their history wiped from the books at least had original spectacles
  hence why i said a little push not neccesary but at the same time doesnt conflict with established future events    meanwhile unicorn have fucking borderline god mode machines trascendental entities formerly known as newtypes and etc and it still fails to explain something that could simply be assumed to have fallen out of style due how costly newtype research is on top of f91 being a good step on putting oldtypes on the level of newtypes with its biocomputer     in comparison that makes the relatively over the top machines of 0083 look like just a drop in the ocean compared with the full blown bullshittery of the unicorn series i mean the unicorns dont even use a super unknown black box as core they can afford to even make three of those machines and the neo zeong doesnt fare too badly bullshit wise as well
  to be fair nt is kinda really just unicorn episode 8 and unicorn itself spent more time on zeon than it did newtypes which nt has more of a focus on
  it still didnt really use this time to explore concepts that needed exploring a lot of viewers seem to think the newtype ghost stuff is new when it absolutely isnt   the other thing is unicorn 2 is likely to make this even more redundant because it will likely fill in a lot of these gaps on its own like explaining what happened to unicorn itself this is like a teaser if anything
  i clapped when i saw the gundam
  you mispelled char
  is uc2 really supposed to be unicorn 2 and not universal century 2 as in a fresh start away from the zeon and newtype mythologies as typified by stuff like f91    because when i hear uc2 what comes to mind more is f91 getting redone perhaps as a full series the next big story arc of the universal century or some shit
  anon get on the modern times oyw is old and busted the unicorn era which will cover a fuckton of incidents is the new cash cow     also doubles as an oyw/z/zz cash cow due randomly throwing callbacks to them wouldnt surprise me if kamille appears later on just to fellate on how awesome banana is
  i mean just to play devils advocate we do know quite a few things    hes a newtype  hes quiet and brooding because his childhood friend seems to have gotten her brain tossed into a robutt  he holds onto the past  he wants to prove himself him getting mad when they tell him to stay back at the beginning  hes somewhat brash and emotional a la every gundam protag ever letting phenex go    i think what youre looking for is what makes him different
  diiiiiiiiiiiiiiijeeeeh
  shiranai ashita okoshite
sydney or dublins colony drop which one is worst and does the most impact in the timeline
  sydney     that shit was the wound that never healed
how much grunt action is in narrative do geara zulus have any screentime
  when does the 2 drops take place
i dont get it why does uc keep on telling its stories revolving around a colony drop incident we already have that in original msg series stardust memory unicorn zz and now nt are the writers lazy or something
  didnt 0083 have a drop in thr american midwest is this now the toronto drop also nevet heard of a hawaii drop before eitherf waikiki
    this this is the city of canberra
    so terrible that everyone forgot what happened to toronto and the mile high wave from south of hawaii
  how terrible is the scale for toronto and hawaii i wonder why are these 2 colony drop incidents not mentioned as much as the one from sydney
  as bad as tomino sometimes was the man at least had a vision for its baby uc gundam shit got stupid at the end of his involvement with uc gundam but it was still reasonable enough    without him at the helm random ass people with barely any understanding of how the universal century and specially newtypes and ideologies works went to fuck shit with stupid retcons retroactively add shit that makes no sense with future events and turn the newtypes from mere jedi wannabes and poster boys of an ideology to fucking reality warpers    and as you said the original design of uc only had two colony drop at least until hacks even bigger than tomino was decided that they needed to one up tomino with their very own colony drops
    hes not talking about two other colony drops its the same colony drop but the other two fragments supposedly landed near toronto and hawaii gundam century 1981 explains how it went down not necessarily the accepted or canon explanation now since the databook is obsolete as hell but its still a nice read    ctrlf british      and heres the corresponding pages from the reprinted renewal edition of gundam century showing where they thought the impacts were      
  thx based uc history poster
  thanks for the links anon    btw if im not mistaken there is also a colony drop in zz this wasnt even mentioned as frequent as sydneys colony drop
  this wasnt even mentioned as frequent as sydneys colony drop  yep because it was nowhere near as destructive as sydney it just kinda falls down onto the city and thats it like an ice cream cone that falls onto the floor and lands upside down judau and a bunch of other named characters were all around the area and they got off pretty scot free meanwhile its more or less accepted that operation british resulted in hundreds of millions of deaths nearly immediately and massive worldwide devastation due to tidal waves and shit so that was the bigger loss of the day
  no one except us give a fuck up it   it had maybe twenty seconds in zeta
      lets not forget the american midwest getting its shit pushed in by a whole colony in stardust
  because sunrise has not resorted to saying gundam is female to woe female audience as bishi designs has grip on fujoshits demography
  amuro made the suit known just by sitting on it
  well shit
  maybe to oldfags and neckbeards    most of everything here might as well be literally who to newbies
    i dont remember being this dumb when i was 14
  i dont get it why does uc keep on telling its stories revolving around a colony drop incident    its almost like having two nuclear bombs dropped on them while being handed a devastating loss in a war that destroyed their country and caused deep economic hardships for two entire generations of survivors had some kind of deep impact on their national psyche that keeps getting expressed through their popular media even decades later
  i really need this answered
  the japs use uc as shorthand to refer to unicorn they most certainly do not use uc1 to refer to what english fanbase calls early uc and therefore dont use uc2 to refer to what we call late uc        besides uc2 points to the year uc0104 on the timeline and they stressed that it was note greenlit yet and the reveal was unintentional
  uc2 could also possible be a shorthand to refer to something different than unicorn
  because they didnt let it rip
  in time well see but unicorn sells like hotcakes for now
considering this thread isnt just people raging at nt or posting pics of japanese fans raging at nt i have to assume that this movie is good
  expect f91 and crossbones to be erased either with the events of hathaways flash or in the follow up or do what i do and separate gundam into the tomino timeline uc hf crossbone all the way up to turn a with no trace of unicorn and the anime timeline only stuff thats been animated excluding f91 and following these movies
  f91 and crossbone  erased  which means  no downsizing of mobile suits  instead leading to  gaia gear
     tomino timeline   includes hasegawa works   but tomino totally wrote the original crossbone   literally no source ever said this and he gets the exact same credit on every gundam manga novel etc
  i wasnt really considering tominos authorship i just mean that crossbone definitely takes place after f91 in the same universe and its that universe that culminates in turn a that being said i was vaguely under the impression tomino was the author
     i just mean that crossbone definitely takes place after f91 in the same universe and its that universe that culminates in turn a    whats the difference between that and unicorn stardust memories etc which all obviously take place after a respective work too
  every story up to cca is pretty much canon while every story after is arguable with some choosing to disregard unicorn to better fit in hathaways flash for example and you can pick and choose each independent of one another crossbone however is unique in that if you choose to take it as canon you pretty much have to do the same for f91 thats what im trying to say
  japan is loving it
    gundam uc is literally the japanese title of unicorn    also universal century is 宇宙世紀 and not uc
actually looks like uc is the official english title too so is  just retarded or something
  yus thanks anon
  thinking back on it i guess it is too much of a coincidence for universal century to translate perfectly
    i dont understand your reasoning and all why would you have to pick and choose for unicorn why is f91 only canon if you accept crossbone
  huh im not saying i pick and choose im saying some people pick and choose personally i dont really regard anything after unicorn to be canon but lots of people have lots of different opinions   and my point is that crossbone needs f91 because crossbone is a direct continuation of f91 carrying over factions characters and history saying crossbone happened without f91 would be like saying zz is canon but not z or that cca happened but the oyw didnt
     and my point is that crossbone needs f91 because crossbone is a direct continuation of f91 carrying over factions characters and history saying crossbone happened without f91 would be like saying zz is canon but not z or that cca happened but the oyw didnt    why include crossbone at all if its just a tomino timeline its not necessary for any other work and while f91 is nessecary to include it i cant see why thats unique because you could say the same of chars counterattack and unicorn or 0079 and 0080
  thicccccc holy shit baby girl looking like a nu and zz love child in this pic
  which which is why i said this is specifically only the case in regards to things that take place after cca jesus i feel like all im doing is repeating myself here     on a different note tomino line is the most useful title because its regarding a series that starts with tomino oyw and ends with tomino turn a and hews generally closer to his books
    you didnt specify that it was unique only in regards to post chars counterattack content as far as i can see i also still have no idea why you think crossbone should be part of a tomino timeline you initially said it was because f91 was nessecary to explain crossbone but that doesnt explain why you need to include crossbone at all
  except i did though    every story up to cca is pretty much canon while every story after is arguable     and my point was entirely the opposite that if one accepts crossbone as canon then they must accept f91 as canon for obvious reasons ive already explained you dont have to accept crossbones as part of the timeline if you dont want to but its advised you do as it completes an unfinished tomino work f91 while laying the groundwork for a subsequent tomino work victory
    saying every story after it is arguable doesnt specify that when you talk about crossbone being unique that its only in terms of post chars counterattack entries the implication doesnt automatically carry between sentences also doesnt complete the story of f91 everything f91 sets up is resolved off screen and the main characters are secondary characters at best with entirely new stories goals etc
  watched it yesterday  bits of nice animation here and there despite some people complaining about character design  story was meh and somewhat coherent  fight scenes were basically space  telekinesis battle  the japanese guys all around me were sort of laughing at all the magic battles after the movie ended  seemed like a lot of reused ost tracks from unicorn   if you are not trying to be a critic and just going in to enjoy then its not bad
nt ost  lets rearrange unicorn ost  sawano literally ran out of ideas
    damni wonder what things would be like if we dropped the third on tokyo and killed the emporer
    my problem is that we dont know these things we assume these things because were making an assumption on his character archetype    you cant storytell by trope though thats horrible form  look this guys hair goes down to his eyes hes a pretty emo feller
    there was no third not for months afterward the two america dropped were the only two they had at the time and for a while afterwards
  also universal century is 宇宙世紀 and not uc  the official abbreviation used in official materials is indeed uc    in my opinion uc is retconned engrish 宇宙世紀 translates literallly as space era my guess is that they tried to abbreviate uchuu seiki as uc it was afterwards that they made uc mean universal century officially in english as a backronym of sorts
    well change tokyo for nagasaki then what would have been the outcome
  if you are not trying to be a critic and just going in to enjoy then its not bad  talk about a backhanded compliment   if you dont think about it too hard youll enjoy it
  宇宙世紀  iirc isnt that lifted in part from the moonspeak version of star treks stardate
  was part of this miracle children incident  believes he deserves no credit for it but that his friend was the one responsible  he immediately trusted her and more or less understood what she did and what she showed him so of the two main characters it seems he was closer to her back then  he believes by all accounts correctly that his childhood friend is inside the phenex in some capacity  absolutely unwilling to risk hurting her  his goals are likely at odds with those of his corporate patroness  who may or may not have had a thing for him but he was always more concerned for phenexgirl  piloting the narrative wasnt easy for him in any capacity judging by the amount of equipment he has to wear and how worn out he seemed afterwards  may or may not be a cybernewtype  if anything by the end of the first 23 minutes i could say more about this new guys motivations and mindset than i could about bananaji at the end of uc
  it doesnt seem that farfetched but its worth repeating that the art of translation isnt a hard and fast 11 thing all the time
  in my opinion uc is retconned engrish 宇宙世紀 translates literallly as space era my guess is that they tried to abbreviate uchuu seiki as uc it was afterwards that they made uc mean universal century officially in english as a backronym of sorts  no universal century was mark simmons doing
  no it isnt
    tokyo was already flattened by regular ol firebombing so not much the reason hiroshima and nagasaki were chosen despite being relatively small cities is that every larger city was already rubble due to firebombing campaigns
    despite the damage the fucking yellow monkeys still wouldnt surrender the nuclear bombs were a lastditch attempt to force a surrender before the us went allin with the land invasion operation downfall    truman lemay macarthur and the rest of the military establishment of the day saw nuclear weapons not as a doomsday device but a way to concentrate the firepower of a whole bombing wing on a single aircraft    in any case what scared the japs into surrender werent the nukes themselves but the soviet invasion of manchuria happening at the same time 
    guy who wants to save his childhood friend is just his job description though
mudrock    is that a kit or robot damashii am i dreaming or is my boy finally getting some love
  neither here nor there its called a gframe look it up incidentally heres the c pack for the narrative
  so the time has come    and so will i
      what would have happened if we had killed the emporer is what i think hes asking anons
    the emperor wasnt living in the middle of a city to bomb in the first place its likely to have driven japan in to a corner socially in a way theyd refuse to surrender even if the us had managed to kill him because japan revered the emperor as a god and they were already wavering on the idea of surrender partially because they were afraid the terms of surrender would include sullying the emperors office if i recall
  the narrative shield looks okay shame about those massive stickers all over the kit
    so in short if he was killed they really would have fought to the last japanese the wholesale eradication of a people
  i have the gundam fix mudrock toy its fucking awesome
    probably not the last and the russia thing might still have topped the scales regardless but i think theyd probably have held out longer personally and the us had no more atom bombs so theyd probably have invaded im not an expert by any stretch though
    were we building more thought we had some cooking in case of berlin also if russia took japan would we be dealing with a nk issue with them
  some other points you did not mention that are salient    his corporate patroness michelle luio is also his childhood friend and one of the supposed miracle children  michelle is salty about jonah liking rita more than her as evidenced not just by her body language throughout the episode but her line about how rita always got the things that michelle wanted  ritas physical body is definitely dead if any part of her is physically inside the phenex its just her brain in a jar
  false look up the demon core it was the plutonium core for the third bomb that was planned to be dropped but weather conditions didnt allow it the plan was to drop it on august 16th but the japanese officially got the us to accept surrender on the 15th the core then went on to be used in testing but not before it killed the two head researchers one of which died because he was an idiot that wanted to tickle the dragons tail by using a screwdriver to hold the core back fr9m becoming super critical by hand
    what was the intended target
idolfag selfinsert the movie
  ur right but it was good movie
spams thread on /a/  it dies  welp lets go to /m/ next  what other memes did you invent  
the movie is an idealized version of the tv series yes inuniverse watch the tv series
i want to see minmay taking a shower but i also want to see her getting slapped
post only the sweetest edgy designs you know of itt
  cue violence geist    not an ms but i wonder why didnt got memed
  i find the pg mk ii quite edgy it drives its pilots insane and seems to be actually malevolent by itself
  whats up with the leopard having threesomes and making babies
  looking a little dangerous there
  ms  posts a mobile armor
  that just looks like a kitbash or something youd see off gundam breaker
  why didnt got memed  he didnt destroy the zio matrix outpost
  im pretty sure all x hyper guide units were kitbashes theyre meant to be able to be created with models
  granted its two edgiboi ms combined together
  how is this edgy swordmaster literally has more edges due to having em swords than this
    most dangerous
  am i reading this correctly gundam screamarms lol
  hey guys remember that episode of 00 gundam when sayla made a cameo while piloting a red psycho gundam my favorite part was when that weird zeta gundam fought against downs custom hizak
  what about tht gundams leg
  hi trypticon
  theyre possible upgrade plans that were never used in the show the airmaster has them too one makes them amphibious one makes them meleefocused and one plays up their transformation mechanism    also blau calamity because you can never go wrong with more guns
  i know its just the leopard designs seem to be kitbashes of existing kits    the tank version of the leopard both has the zaku tank and guntank lower bodies
      cant stop hes just a soldier
  leopard was a basic bitch in x with just gatling guns in that respect its probably a decent platform to build off of because its basic enough that additional features wont be counterproductive with its primary purpose
  jahanams are bros tho
  o gundam  autaa  i am confusion should that not be omicron
  isnt this that one ms that has issues because it can deplete all its battery in a short amount of time because of all those weapons
    like i said theyre all kitbashes    the virsago assassin here has the v2s vsbrs as the text points out
  no that was another machine that was used as the testbed for the freedom and justices weapons it had to be tethered to an asteroid base in order to be used in combat and not run out of power too quickly    
  very neat
  okay so zssa back zgok armscrossbone legs gundam torso and head
        edgy
were reaching levels of edgy that shouldnt be technically possible
  leopard iron  groundtype shield knees  oversized denan zon shoulders  bolt gundams arms  hammer  fucking hot      i think those are just the regular leopard legs i think i see the missilepods pocking out behind the zugoke claws but other than that i think so
spooky season
  no the issues from the ks were a result of shitty management who had never handled a project of this scale or type before i was only speaking of why degica is no longer a part of the equation and why there was such a huge gap between updates it was a 7 month delay of effectively complete silence if im remembering correctly its also the reason why updates have pretty much stopped being a monthly thing and are now only done every 36 months
  i see but didnt the handover take place back in nov 2017 that means that the updates coming in from 2018 were from ixtl cant remember when the last update was this year but it seems like they tried their best to send out the physicals which then got screwed up still waiting on some items i never got  however considering ixtl/ages performance with project management and product release do they really have the allowance to say that degica couldnt keep to the timelines due to shitty management or was there something else
        no the issues from the ks were a result of shitty management  seems oddly consistent in blaming the ks failure on lack of sexual content though
do we really need 3 threads
  from my point of view the kickstarter was a resounding success most people got their items and the original product the kickstarter was created for ended up releasing take a look at other vn kickstarters and youll see why i consider it a success
  i mostly agree which is why i wonder how the anon i quoted arrived at his conclusion over the ks status and how much of it is made up bullshit
  id followed the updates from ks and the official forums and it seems that ixtl/age planned to do the 18 for ml from the start there was some issues with the 18 for mla last year with one update saying it was pushed to after all the releases were done but we still got the patch this year
 spooky
  we can go spookier
hey guys its time for lacrosse haha
  and this is to go even further beyond
  how anyone can still like sumika after this is beyond me
  is this tentacle rape
  socks removed
  ptsd sumika is still an improvement over extra sumika
  breast enlargement will forever be weird
  that just means you will never be as cool as takeru
who was the most divisive muvluv character sumika or beatrix
    gattai
  they are so perfect together
  not a cuck like takeru you mean
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
  he was willing to fight those soldierclass things barehanded without a second thought even though he knew hed die horribly that makes takeru a true /m/an in my book
  delet this
did anyone mrriored that strike frontier collection   i dont want to download anything because guy might delete or relocate it he notice sudden increase in downloads
  theyll never tell us whats with the beta vagina huh
my god this scene gave me ptsd
  just import it to your mega account then download it from there
  iirc if you import from one mega to another it just puts a shortcuttypepointer to the source file so if it gets nuked your imported copy goes too
  check if my country even has a lacrosse team  never seen anyone play it locally or televized   its actually ranked 5th in the world  nobody cares
  what country
tempted to buy muvluv what should i expect/go in knowing
  first half of first game is essentially a parody of its own genre cutesy highschool dating sim/eroge yur mileage may vary second half gets into the actual /m/ stuff
yikes and the ps3 version is even more expensive well ill take the plunge and see how it goes
  it was literally just on sale on pc for 17 fuck you doing brah
愚かなる豚ども  この私の前にひれ伏しなさい    why does beatrix get so angry when you bring up her performance in sf
  pirate it first make sure you get the torrent that has the content restoration patch in it once youve read both titles ask yourself if it was worth the 110 and if it was theres your answer personally id recommend against buying it simply because the new publisher is a legitimate cancer and the developers arent good people either theyve screwed a ton of people on the kickstarter for it since they never got some of the physical goods they backed for or they didnt get any of their physical goods at all in quite a few cases
  they also robbed us of the anatomically correct fortified suits for no reason
  the anger i feel in regards to this is overwhelming its the epitome of being petty
  do we still have no source for the actual cg sets it may be better than nothing to screen cap the scenes but cg est would still be best
  yeah i eventually found it was mentally indisposed at the time still need to pull the trigger    guess im not pulling the trigger thanks for the heads up
  beatrix and lise should be dragged into the woods and beaten up
  its not correct nipples arent beads
  her pout at the end is cute
  nobody on /m/ gives a shit about your shitty cardboard nazi knockoff murderboner sadist give me more antagonists like sagiri who though a punchable douchebag was a realistic and very human punchable douchebag who had ideals an actual motive and made a pretty damn good point from his limited perspective he was right about the government     just goes to show you how everything since alternative has been an absolute decline for age
  lol
  learn what anatomically correct means before trying to be a smartass
  mfw
last update on the site is from the 17th of july    i just want more tda bros ive been waiting for so long
  i just await the day kyoko gets more fanart and recognition also last thread was fucking false ikaruga didnt get his lousy shitcovered hands on this angel
  斑鳩 崇継    uh he did and she enjoyed it
  there is no face therefore no proof all you have is pictures of a lower body could be takeru for all i know and i cant read japanese so dont bother wasting my time with it
  dialogue is no proof
            how did the sf archival go anons
  translation fucking never
who made this  i need more  
      at least post the good stuff
  even better stuff    
      while were on the topic of yt    stand a chance pastiche fucking where
  did the later chapters of the mango keep them i remember the early parts had even more detail than the games
my blops 4 emblem
  quality content my dude
ponytail or long and loose
  thats actually nice as shit dude
  cool      i prefer long and loose wheres this from like a sidestory where the germans end up in japan or something
  sf scenario where theo discovers a picture of a teenaged iris in a kimono then gets iris to play dressup
next question pantyhose or no pantyhose
and finally cat iris
      lise is going to freak the fuck out
  its sf what are you talking about theres lots of lise sets too and they were all compiled video recorded and english translated a long time ago at that   
  just saying iris seems fine having a three way sexual relationship with theo with beatrix in sf but lise is the type who is definitely not going to share
  in sf  thats the point with the only exceptions of sylwia and farka pretty much every girl in sm with at least an sr card has sex cgs with theo no matter whether its logical or in character or sensible or even moral or not also lise seeks monogamous marriage with theo as one of her centermost defining traits so of course she wouldnt want to share but of course its way deeper than that too given hes not only her entire world but she needs him simply to survive and go on living
  still waiting for someone to repost the translation of that beatrix scenario where shes hanging all over theo while hes bound to the chair
  go to   look up ベアトリクス  find it yourself
  translations
  thats his name
  haha no  
  the suit wouldnt wrap around nipples like that unless the nipples are hardened
  i would think military higher ups wouldnt want their ho to look underage
   next question pantyhose or no pantyhose  thigh  highs
  yes  include garter belt as well
  shes not military
  this scenario is not canon and a retarded ooc it was only chosen for the porn because he was the only guy who interacted with her in the main canonical storyline she has an aversion to him sf plots are cancer
whens the fucking 15 year event
  
    
      will you do this for the rest    noodz included
    thanks
  punchable face
  is this srwf
  youre welcome bud
isnt kouki kind of a hack when you think about it sumikas arc is just a ripoff of harukas from kgne they both are in a close relationship with the mc both go out of commission due to tragic circumstances and then get sprung up again to act as a source of emotional gravity for the mc at least in kgne you had the choice to be/stay with mitsuki unlike being wholly forced onto sumika the almost rape attempt scene with meiya comes off as a real tease when you consider how a more faithful crossover would work mitsukis and meiyas respective personalities and motivations dont exactly line up but just imagine it it also doesnt help that he took the one outstanding negative that people use to characterize mitsuki and then essentially gave it to sumika is stacking all that unfavorable shit against her then making her the one true heroine what saving in the name of true love is supposed to mean or is it just a hack job
  that would take forever to do
  kind of
i love this franchise but if their announcement a the 15 year anniversary after fucking delaying the event is a eurofront vn im probably out the things i really want them to do is make a big final for tda or advance the main timeline in something that is not a info magazine
  if their announcement a the 15 year anniversary after fucking delaying the event is a eurofront vn    youre hella optimistic i like that
  their announcement will be they dont have an announcement screencap this
  maybe theyll get ideas from the ffxv anniversary and use the announcement to say that actually everything is cancelled
1 and half year later  final part still left untranslated  uh guys
  if the guy actually uploaded the raws instead of hardsubs i could translate for you but he didnt and i didnt pay the age fanclub jewgold so i guess both of us are fucked
has anyone done the survey on the age official site apparently theres questions about tda such as if you remember that its a thing and if you want them to finish it or not be sure to tell them no and if you get the chance that you want more mobage
  not voting for smaniax or 48 years after
  smaniax  as much as i want to see lise having a happy live in the extraverse i dont think age can pull off a satisfying story set in rl east germany let alone a well written one
  dont make it too happy and focus on sol with the state terror stuff implied around the edges but not in focus make sure that axmann and beatrix are absent from the story
  that wont work the hohensteins were too political for them not to get into trouble making their escape west succeed is a far better solution as it dodges the problem entirely
  if only theres no point in canceling things if you never bother working on them either way    they used up all their creativity a decade ago and are a fucking terrible company just be done with it
  what the fuck kouki im literally shaking right now
  tl
praise beta
  man im sorry to say but just by the way this thing is structured you can already tell they just plan on making more mobile shit    im on question 23 and they havent even asked me what âge titles i have played yet
  they want to know if you ever had a gf
  they want to know if you ever had a gf  5 possible answers  doubtpng
  chrome auto translates people
  its okay anon one day your waifu will become real
  actually i have multiple partners but just in case im putting 4
how to filter your target audience
about time they got to this some very specific questions about mobile games
questions getting serious
  im sure that dipshit sold avex on buying them by trying to equate their pc sales and reception relative to type moon to some sort of potential for pulling an fgo never mind they have abjectly failed in every single attempt at different media    its pretty pathetic even if you look where fate is now they could actually get something like the entirety of muvluv animated even if they got there on the back of heavily compromised projects not that i think they ever could have succeeded on that level fates success as an adv game was much more related to the premise and characters because their production values back in the day were fucking shit while ml gets so much of its attention from presentation      other  how does that even make sense to ask for that question the fuck are young girls war and heavily and late      didnt even list schwarzesmarken  lmao
this is easily the wierdest question in the whole thing it basicially wants to know which setting you would be most interested in for a new muv luv title theres the obvious near future and also current day nippon yurop murrica and china    but for some reason they also have a tickboxes for all those countries way in the past they have shit like middle ages europe and sengoku japan what the fuck
  sengoku muv luv sounds like a good way for the series to finally die
  the fuck are young girls war  its fucking google translate what else do you expect  shojou senki aka saga of tanya the evil
  i think they mean an alternate history through time jump shenanigans pre beta war involving the ml characters think star trek first contact
  its actually pretty much the only one that makes sense instead of trying to transpose nipnong right wing politics and themes on top of other settings      im asking because i have literally no idea what the hell those shitty translations started as also its youjo you dip
    how does that even make sense to ask for that question  its there so meiyafags can put banner of the stars
  listen they can teleport the extra cast into the fucking dinosaur age for all i care and i would still read that shit but at some point somebody in the company has to realize that if you are seriously considering middle ages europe muv luv you should just create a new ip i actually really enjoyed muramasas alternate history of japan for example
  im asking because i have literally no idea what the hell those shitty translations started as  neither did i since i didnt check the original jp but you can make an educated guess based on the engrish if you have a brain use it
guess we know what the next series is next question was how excited are you to see a sequel to this
  wow im sorry i knew exactly what the other 90 of them were but dont know what every single anime ever made google translates to
  i am very certain this is meant to be a wild brain storming session for a moba scenario only instead of an actual sequel in the franchise something like what sf did   alternatively it also looks like settings other anime/game media are in so maybe its a collaboration feedback compilation
  it probably has the biggest potential out of everything they could do right now they can go complete apeshit creatively without having to worry about things like future sequels because we know the tda world is more or less fucked anyway its probably going to have a bittersweet ending where humanity on earth is never 100 wiped out is my guess
    when i saw in the anime that her family was killed and she was raped i was so triggered really its just sad damn fuck beatrix and axmann fuck them in hell with satans spiked dick
  arguably whoring herself out for stasi gain is way worse than getting raped
  time for healing       if you mean being forced into sexual servitude by her rapists for years to keep her last remaining family member alive would be worse than a single instance of getting raped than yeah but aside from the initial rape all together it was really just long term rape over many instances anyway so same difference
    i want to see lise having a happy live in the extraverse  seconding this  making their escape west succeed is a far better solution as it dodges the problem entirely  and this i like that idea
  yuuki yuuna is a brave man
  t even list schwarzesmarken  it didnt list te either those are mainline ml games except for the moba shit
theres a new cg set out of katia getting the axmann treatment now if only it were beatrix instead thatd be a lot hotter from both a justice standpoint and sex appeal standpoint
  te is the 5th option you blind fuck
  didnt even list schwarzesmarken  even age wants to forget about that abomination
  thats why they have failed mobage on there
  stay strong theo poor man he has to raise the kid from one of lises clients
  well thats a retarded thing to say she was never pregnant and even if would have been noticeably so by the start of schwarzesmarken in 1983 not to mention condoms were explicitly mentioned to be used in requiem so no when theres no plausibility to your shitposts they just make you look like a retard
  i do kind of wonder how the ml protags would be as fathers    takeru  dumb and embarrassing but genuinely loves his kids    yuuya  i think hed be strict but overall hed be a good dad    theo i dunnowhat do you guys think
    konosuba  smartphone  rezero  tanya    its pretty obvious theyre trying to ride the isekai wave by making their own medieval/swords and magic isekai muvluv to be honest it might work isekai smartphones main plot is literally a less serious mla clone and mla is an isekai in the first place just without the swords and magic part
  takeru  dumb and embarrassing but genuinely loves his kids  so he would be like homer simpson the classic version of him of course not the idiot they made out of him after season 10      id read/watch a medieval inspired version of muv luv kinda like how quake 1 is a mix of several different settings but only if theyd come up with new characters and not some reskinned or poor mans versions of ones theyve already used in the trilogy and the ln spinoffs
  not some reskinned or poor mans versions of ones theyve already used in the trilogy and the ln spinoffs  you know perfectly well that age is too lazy to do that
  god why did you have to mention it now retards here are going to flood it with shit answers and theyll make a shitty mobile game instead
      and now theyll disregard all the survey answers and make a shitty mobile game thanks to you good job dumbfuck
literally incapable of not thinking about dicks  i bet she chose archery because she thinks of them as dicks penetrating her
    imagine being this hard in denial about the state of the modern world the entire vn industry is dying and trying to switch to gacha games regardless of some fucking survey results the kids that grew up with smartphones are now reaching the age where they are supposed to be the new vn target audience but they cant be arsed to consume long and expensive as fuck books  dies irae mobile game baldr mobile game tokyo necro mobile game this shit is getting more and more common and its not going to stop
  would officers normally be into kiddy jailbait
  fate animes
  if it doesnt end with that exact scene of takeru dead in a wrecked gekishit im going to be upset
  what if they make muvluv dungeon travellers
  we can argue about that when it gets announced i guess which it probably wont if they had really big balls they could even kill hibiki halfway through the vn and have punished takeru be the protag for the rest
  i watched both anime on crunchyroll and i have to say the one about the east german story was the best lol at the little sister going insane and becoming a slave of that evil guy  stuff had me laughing hope we get another muv luv anime
quick how do i say give back nipples in pilot suits in moon
  just spam 乳首 over and over
  i wrote 強化装備に乳首を戻して
  i dont care man just let me have my dream its not like theres going to be more new stuff about ml at this point 
  isnt being included in srw the 15 year event
you will never hump meiya in her fortified suit
  tryna make me depressed huh
  leave it to takeru to make a habit of fucking around with military equipment
  heres that scene without those stupid text boxes      meiya is military equipment
photon flowers when
  without those text boxes  how do you do it
still no phamalam sf cg
  it finally got into srw  its the fucking mobage  yall got monkey pawed
just playing the phoenix point demo i found this and thought of you guys i wonder if the devs are ml fans or if its just a coincidence
  probably a coincidence its just the name of a japanese deity that both things happened to use
  its dead jim
hey is there anyway to read the manga past chapter 37     im trying to find the other chapters
  wow who would have guessed that takeru is the tallest protag
  the hair just keeps getting longer
what would a date with stella be like
    moar
  straight into action
    stupid sexy stella
  thats my wife delete this
  why is tama scene the only uncensored version
  hes the only one who doesnt look like a faggot so it makes some sense
is the digital version of codex out yet
theres no easy way out    theres no shortcut home
is that a fucking laser class in mikakunin de shinshoukei or is there another monster that also inspired the laser class design
  one is ten years old and the other is almost twenty so you decide
  wat
  
  that looks like mothman to me
  thats mothman you ignorant fuck
      how do you not know mothman hes like one of the five most famous umas hes in yugioh and castlevania and smt and shit
  didnt play any of those thanks for the info
for those who download the muvluv sf archive are the kurogane ssr videos in there    i cant find it and i wanted to see if there was any new tda content with it
  yes its 184  and no there is nothing its just  a few days after jfk hive he remembers about the capsule or whatever that he crushed and about sumika then he dreams about his training days with everybody and hes happy then a few days later in his dream sumika comes back from hospital when he sees her he cries then they go on a date finally she tells him its time to wake up from the dream and that takeru is always takeru no matter where he comes from and shell always love him  then he wakes up crying but doesnt remember anything about the dream but feels like he was forgiven for something then he keeps crying a bit
    was hoping it would shed some light on what happened to him in between unlimited and tda but i guess i shouldnt have expected anything from a mobage     thanks anon
  tda final announcement any day now anon    ssurely
  my face when they announce tda final chapter but its only in a mobage
mfw they announce tda final chapter and its armored core 6
  we already got money pawd ridiculously hard
    well at least we know that itll be in english some day right right
  aaah dont remind me
so basically what weve learned from tdas jfk hive operation is that if alternative humanity werent massive fucking retards they could have been adding shadow nukes to the hive attack strategy many years ago and they might have actually captured more than just one hive by now
  nope cause   if superiorchan wasnt kekd  more hives come from moon  nukes used on earth uses up stock protecting space  more hives land on earth  earth gets kekd
  nigga the superpowers built literally tens of thousands of warheads during the cold war irl
  meant for 
  but only a small fraction was a strategic warheads meant to destroy cities and fortified bases in practice practically entire arsenal was tactical warheads meant to be used agains military camps moving batalions of tanks or flotillas of warships etc and most of thier military potential was in radiation and emp they generated during explosion
  would it really count as capturing a hive if the entire area were irradiated to hell and back the jfk hive being located on uselss salt plains was the only reason they could do it
  what do betas do on the moon
  stand around with hands in their pockets
  if alternative humanity werent massive fucking retards  implying humanity from the normal world isnt filled with massive retards as well  besides did you even bother to read through alternative thoroughly its been explained a few times why infiltrating hives at all was close to impossible let alone get out of them alive and nuke the hell out of them shit even if youd just read through unlimited its hinted at how bad it is to use nuclear weapons and how they shouldnt be used unless there are no other options left
    
  that pic  well deserved dubs
  keep posting that shit youre just jealous that lise is everyones favorite
  why is beatrix dressed up as katia
    the writing for schwarzes markem is so stupid the premise is idiotic its so schizophrenic and tries to do too much at once but none of it very well one of the most hilarious things right off the bat is that theres no introduction to the characters and way too many characters even the laziest show took time to introduce the situation and character throughout the whole anime i was asking who are these people due to bad setup the stasi are probably the worst element everything they do makes absolutely no sense theyre losing people by the hundreds of thousands monthly can see the beta aliens from berlin yet still only care about undermining and killing their political enemies and keeping east germany from cooperating with the west schwarzes marken may have been one of the worst things i have seen this year    and the opening is some trashy dance dance revolution shit which is especially depressing as the opening for alternative was done by jam project i wanted to say something nice about schwarzes marken but there is not a single redeeming factor to it this show is terrible and i hated every bit of it its been a while since i hated something this much its worse than terra formars
  dance dance revolution    same initials as deutsche demokratische republik
   start on halloween   its now thanksgiving  can we keep this thread til christmas
  your wife isnt yours shes ours remember shes communist in a classless society we share that ass    also please for the love of god someone tell me theres more
  doubtful
since muvluv is in srw mobile how does yuuko interact with people there
  so how long would you last
  no shit why would you watch the anime  do you not know japanese  yikes
  i shouldnt have expected anything from a mobage  the mobage still gave stuff like showing how takayuki and shinji died
    one of the major factors during the operation was     the original aversion towards nukes in capturing hives was that the fallout would slow down any rebuilding over the nearby region in immediate times for the establish a forward base for units operating further up frontline and in the future for resettlement by humans     however since the value of the salt plains estate market is literally nonexistent and the jfk reactor was targeted for destruction instead of capture nukes stopped being nonviable    retards is a bit too strong you could lambast alternative humanity for being too hopeful and trying to get back their cake and eat it too especially in the face of strategic warfare against an alien swarm race but thats that    it certainly beats some other /m/ decisions like trying to microwave the only habitable planet in the solar system
nuke the moon  nuke the core  nuke the sun
  they mightve gotten around to that if the chicoms hadnt killed it for everyone
  i wouldnt be sticking my dick into crazy
  beatrix did nothing wrong
  screwed a ton of people on the kickstarter  examples only hitches in the road seemed to be the publisher change and the delays on those physical goods how many people didnt get their rewards i know i got mine which is why im confused on this
  its worse  its the fucking chain chronicle clone  literally barely a month later they reveal an srw mobage that actually plays like srw that muv luv wont be in
  i got my physical rewards but i was still hoping for the photon melodies stuff and thats mia at best also vita bros got screwed entirely they havent got their goods iirc
  i remember it being an issue for a lot of foreigners due to customs tax being applied that shouldnt have been applied since degica/age had already paid the customs tax people who ordered vita physicals also never got any of their stuff due to age wanting to ship everything together i think some people are also missing items on their boxes that they were supposed to get from their backertier or were sent different pillows than what they had originally selected
  uncensor patch doesnt even work on versions installed from the disk
    nope got my vita games in jul i think there was some issues with the physicals for some people but only for a selected few
  really thats good to hear at least this thread made me check back on the kickstarter according to the comments people have started getting your stuff has shipped emails for the vita like comments from one or two weeks ago so i guess theres still a spark of life left in the kickstarterheres hoping we get news on photon melodies
  you seem to be the exception to the rule
  with the record theyve garnered for themselves thus far you probably shouldnt get your hopes up
  fd in the a by the ip owners again
  its been that way since they robbed us of the anatomically correct fortified suits
  you you were warned have some correct fort suits
  why does classrep looks flatchested with the suit  its wrong
  chottos    
  thats what she says a lot  like verbal tick
  id breed chizuru on the spot
  verbal tick
    no they whoever wrote the uncensor patch just didnt give a shit    the patch is written in a way that it assumes the steam version is installed the cd version has entirely different install locations and shit like different exe names    the cds are pretty much worthless
  you are supposed to unpack it in the install directory i think shouldnt be affect by the folder location  i think its more to do with the fact that the dvd ver is an older version and that theres 3 different directors patch so its fucking confusing which to use
  3 different directors patch  er  what i thought there was only one for ml and one for mla for the steam version or did the degica release get a different patch than the one that got released after that
  theres at least two one released by degica for the degica release then one released by age for the sekai project release which is the one featuring an updated translation that fixes typos and a few bugs it really is a pain in the ass because theres two different versions of extra/unlimited and two different versions of alternative that has been sold on steam  various other places not counting the vita release theres also only 1 alternative patch which is for the sekai project release due to degica having been removed from everything muvluv related by the time the alternative patch came out
  the uncensor patch is an exe  literally tells you the game isnt installed if you are running a cd copy no matter what you do
  isnt the dvd ver updated on steam i thought i installed it using the dvd then applied the update then the patch and it worked maybe im looking at the wrong files i just installed to the default
sekai project gets involved  updates practically stop  if sp had their name on the kickstarter id have never touched it because i knew this exact shit would happen
  how so
  because its been this way for 95 of their other kickstarters
  this project already went to the shitter when they hired like 5 guys to retranslate everything and it took them fucking forever for some reason they also chose to update the engine which must have caused all kinds of trouble    im also pretty sure they ported the english vita version from scratch instead of cooperating with whoever published the japanese version because that one was on store shelves on fucking january 2016    lets not forget the utteryl retarded stretchgoal that were planned at first this whole thing was fucked from the start    i also really dont like how they didnt stich extra and alternative into one game and market it as generic moeshit on steam for the new audience i feel like that really could have given the game a new popularity boost especially considering that if they hadnt fucked up their release window several times they would have beaten ddlc to the punch    
  how have they not gone under yet
  people keep pledging to their kickstarters
  the entire thing screamed sekai project bullshit from the start its your own damn fault for kickstarting shit thats already made
  they said they were going to be doing a directors cut patch which would completely restore and uncensor all previously removed content that was a lie also their reason for not restoring everything was wed have to make a separate japanese version since we wouldnt be able to sell it over there if we did that total fucking bullshit
  but 
  youre right it doesnt make sense but for whatever reason people keep giving them money even after getting fucked over time and time again i dont understand it either
whens 1st photon release date  i just want supplement to be translated
  its the allages console port it wont have anything good
  supplement story dont have lewd scenes anyway cept for the card game i dont understand on how to play it for lewd scenes
  i just want supplement to be translated  you wont get supplement translated youll have some of the supplements contents in photons
  whats it doing in there
  photon flower and melody are just a collection of various short sidestories that were originally found in stuff like chronicles    you might ask yourself but why would they sell them repackaged then  the answer is that flower and melody were console exclusive shit like chronicles never made it to consoles and the main trilogy had just gotten its console ports    the reason they chose to port flowers and melody back over to pc as stretchgoals clearly was because it would be a way smaller project than actually translating all the games the stories were actually found in    certainly wouldnt be that way in a perfect world but they seem to have made the correct decision considering they are already struggling with getting this out
  they are already struggling with getting this out    struggling or just cant be assed
  could be a bit of both they recently changed addresses so thats never a good thing for a companys production line makes me wonder whats the change in the age employee line up now that avex is in charge and theres no more stream videos theres fuck all to know about what they are doing now
  they recently changed addresses so thats never a good thing for a companys production line    probably trying to avoid being petrolbombed by all the irate fans theyve screwed over
  well they were previously located above the goodsmile hq so i supposed its a good thing that didnt happen
  goodsmile    i dont know what that is
  theres fuck all to know about what they are doing now    by all appearances committing organizational suicide
  holy shit then you dont really matter do you
  age might very seriously be dying right now    they cancel the anniversary fest back in october saying they will provide updates later  it is now december and there have been no updates  streaming has stopped 100 when they used to shit up my subscription feed every single week  strike frontier shut down earlier this year  the only actual sign of life weve had has been the fucking survey that is full of mobile related questions    its really not looking good and while i have no idea what their sales numbers for stuff like schwarzesmarken has been i cant imagine them being that good considering the whole vn industry in general isnt doing as amazing as it did in the late 2000s
  forgot to mention their online shop also seems to be dead at the moment  maybe its okay if things end like this we generally had a good run
  forgot to mention their online shop also seems to be dead at the moment  u wot    i just ordered exogularity 2 from it
  right now  more like they died off slowly in the past decade fans have been disappointed about them a long time ago long before the whole degica fiasco  ah well as  said maybe its for the best if they laid muv luv to rest and keep it there its become a sad tragedy at this point so much that the company around it is in much more trouble than the characters of the vns ever had been
  replace that point with bad website management then
    thats what they get for hiring former fan translators instead of real translators    sekai project  oh wait thats their entire staff
  only as much as you do apparently
  the whole degica fiasco    
  fans have been disappointed about them a long time ago    yeah starting with the removal of the anatomically correct fortified suits
  imagine partnering with a company that is supposed to help you out with publishing the game and managment only to cut all ties with said company halfway through the kickstarter so you can hire another one
  you again have another
normally id be averse to the kindofbutnotreally super robot shows that want to have ridiculous fun super robot shit but also want to be serious real robot at the same time like wing but despite that theres something so fucking cool i find about crossbone and i cant put my finger on it  maybe cos its so far into the uc future that even though they need to keep to scientific convention of the timeline but its so detached from the main story that it doesnt feel forced   i love the jerryrigged rogueish feeling of shit like knives hidden in the feet the knee pilebunkers like in pic related and the pirateinspired weaponry
  the thing about crossbone is that it only gets super roboty whenever jovians churn out ridiculous prototypes otherwise its not nearly as ridiculous as unicorn has become
99 of people that wants crossbone anime only knows about it from build fighter otherwise they are just autistic
  implying anybody who watches gundumb isnt autistic
  people have been asking for a crossbone anime since before build fighters was a glint in some sunrise execs eye
  normally id be averse to the kindofbutnotreally super robot shows that want to have ridiculous fun super robot shit but also want to be serious real robot at the same time   then you should hate basically all gundam because its all like that except for g and sd which dispense with the silly idea that gundams are serious military hardware
  spacepirates are objectively awesome
  probably the crossbone units
crossbone is a super robot show meme  the manga literally has less magical hijinks than any of the animated uc stories
  less pyschoframe hijinks but it more than makes up for that in badass crazy ways in which the heroes use their weapons such that psychoframe died so that crazy piloting antics could thrive  yes that last sentence was a joke
  thats a fucking amazing custom
  cant help original one looks like shit
  mechs with capes are awesome
  i really like the x pattern back booster it looks really cool
whats /m/s opinion on the g gundam series
    one of the better au series i am liking it
got some really highhighs but is drug down somewhat by too much filler in the midtosecond half fun series overall though
    i like it
  like it a lot and had fun with it it basically knows what it is goes with it one of my favorite au gu dam series
very fun
  a ton of fun and has broad appeal
nether gundam plamo never
  great series with likeable characters solid story and interesting mecha my fav gundam show desu
fry da sky
  i remember reading about this show in an old issue of some lowkey anime magazine way back in the mid90s thinking it sounded fucking awesome     i really wanted the fight scenes to be like what i had seen in street fighter ii the animated movie gisaburo sugii has an understated talent at directing tense grounded fight scenes unfortunately it was definitely closer to dragon ball z or something    not that this makes it bad i still had a fucking blast with the show it just wowed me in other ways thats all
it had a rocky horror reference in ep 2 in the japanese audio  i would like if i may to take you
its fun gundam to watch at any time
its alright nothing incredible just generically good
  it was my first gundam and i am hype to see its going to be in srw t
  watched it when it aired in the west still patiently waiting for gundam fight 14 to be announced
we all have g gundam to thank for the greatest ms of all time
judging by the gfiles i uploaded a few years back it had a surprising level of thought put into it
its the least gundamish show to bear the gundam title
  the show was fun as hell and still holds up despite being kind of formulaic     it also always amused me how the formation of a mech martial arts tournament created what was otherwise the most peaceful gundam universe
  it actually follows the core themes of gundam far better than most other series do
  2nd least gundamlike  ftfy the least is ibo
its fine but /m/ massively overrates it people remember the good parts being better than they are and the bad parts not being as bad id rewatch the highlight reel but rewatching the whole show would be too much
first half was really good bit too formulaic though  hong kong made me want to kill myself though shit just felt like 2 steps backwards in terms of pacing
rain is hot
  i think itd been better without the tourneyshit
allenbyrain
  thats true for pretty much any 50 episode series
  it has a surprising lack of execution
i want to have sweaty postgundan fight sex with allenby
  pure fun
  this guy acquired abilities of the dark gundam with the help of waldoooo
  i want a sequel where the devil gundam becomes good
  it kind of makes you wonder what would happen if the peace didnt hold any nation that doesnt get their hands on the devil gundam pronto would be capital f fucked
  its fucking stupid doesnt make sense and racist as all hell    i miss g gundam it was amazing
its a fun take and among the better gundam series but i feel like domons friends could have used some more attention and individuality i dont really like that they were reduced to his cheerleaders by the end
  this ability to blend into any crowded area im positive this guy has acquired the power of the dark waldo with the help of kyoooogii
    wouldve been better if they were all balls
i find it fun that domon is stronger on foot than some gundam protagonists in their mobile suits judging by how high he can launch a fucking skyscraper with a kick
   solid story  ill give you the other two points but not so much this one its pretty generic and the later twists undermine the first half quite badly
  dont forget asia straight punching it and he was feeling weak at that moment plus the fact domon and him might not even need gundams
  in what way
im about to finish it up soon actually its like gundam mixed with getter robo pretty sweet honestly
  i would prefer if they dont have a romantic subplot/dont give the romantic subplot too much focus the show should have ended shortly around master asias death and the whole ending from hk to space feels too tackedon    tldr a good show if you arent looking for seriousness
if you watched g gundam in dubbed and worse yet prefer the dub over the original voice acting there is no place in hell deep enough for you
    the most peaceful but not the least destructive since the nations were still destroying the earth in order to facilitate that peace turna at least in the present or something is probably the least destructive or just the build shows if you wanted to count them
  its not really a subplot its the core of the resolution to the main devil gundam storyline  
  honestly i havent watched g in years but i dont remember rain being a huge part on it outside of knowing his brother personally
  when they recite the motto on last time at the end
i wish they made a revise mg of the god gundam current one is outdated af
  its only hong kong that really undermines the foundation laid out in the first half it legitimately makes you go wait so if they can make the gundam fight have an actual tournament schedule and make designated rings with barriers an shit how is the world getting destroyed by them you mean to tell me that no one thought of these things for the twelve previous gundam fights also why the fuck didnt they have these fights on the moon
  eh ibo has a standard gundam premise where the protag and his team of buds ride gundams against an oppressive government system g gundam from beginning to end is a standard battle shonen with a gundam skin and thats a good thing
    ryuha touhou fuhai wa
  in story reason they probably dont want the hundreds of gundams the tournament has to fight there and prefer them beating each other up to the point its manageable    but yeah it does undermine the whole were fucking up the earth bit from the beginning
    i think turn a might be the least gundamlike since it is essentially a ghibli show where mecha take second place to the world exploration
  also why the fuck didnt they have these fights on the moon  too risky the closer they are to the colonies the worse it is for the people actually running the show
  ibo would have been great if they went full edge and write a story thats about a group of kid mercs who floats around the seedy underworld before being thrust into the larger plot what a fucking waste
  so as it turns out devil gundam is thing and domons life is absolutely fucked because rains dad was like super jealous that domons dad came up with a way to perfect an ideal machine selfregen adaptation and multiply mean getting aggravated that his lifes work shining gundam had huge flaws in its system hypermode only responding to pure rage and because of this he went to ulube and told them about devil gundam to seize the project then when that fucks up he and ulube basically come up with that bs story about kyoji and tell domon and rain to go retrieve or destroy rain finds out about this and she becomes filled with so much shame and guilt she just accepts her fate as being devil gundams new pilot so that last stretch in the show is basically domon forgiving rain and her father as well as him finally getting back at the people who lied to him and destroyed his life
  ah fair enough i guess i didnt enjoyed her parts in the show and kinda ignored her moments because they were the most boring bits and i honestly think allenby has a lot more in common with domon while rain just whines in the sideline when hes largely capable of taking care of himself    i feel like rain only comes in when the plot needs someone to pass information to domon and domon was a dumb hotheaded bloke who couldnt get a hint all that with allenby introduced just diluted rains involvement so much for me
allenby is smol and badass
  if the devil gundam went haywire so easily it must have had core flaws too it isnt like there was anything comparable to the super mdoe at the time too so he was just being whiny
  allenby outshining rain is suppose to happen its not only rain getting jealous its also her feeling that domon deserves far better in his life and doesnt really have the right to be there for him
  maybe but the end result is that domon favored a girl with much less chemistry with him
  the thing is domons dad knew it wasnt finish it was on the verge of being finished then ulube storms in so they had to rush it out quickly before the fine tunes could be done or else it would be used as is for ultimate destruction when thats not what he wanted
  it malfunctioned after being sent through the atmosphere giving it self regeneration to such a large degree was a huge flaw was it even tested before deployment
  no domons dad never got the chance too
the battles were usually really fun but domons victory against chibodee in the tournament is one of the most bullshit shonen battle victories i have ever seen
  checking out the new manga and that fight plays out very differently its a bloody slugfest from beginning to end domon only wins by pure luck and determination    he never pulls that cheap trick like in the show
  not bad but not one of my favorite gundams
  i want to read that manga what else is new about it
  holy shit im glad other people were bothered by this that fight pissed me the fuck off
  tons of things omitted some fights are changed due to the shuffle alliance having new ms the tag match with allenby and nobel is changed to a fight with heavens sword and grand gundam    oh and canada gets a new gundam for the second and its something its so ridiculous that i dont want to spoil it
  it can only either be the lumberjack gundam or the moose gundam or the hidden maple syrup gundam
  forgot to mention but the new shuffle gundams make their debut fighting off the four heavenly kings they actually explain how master asia showed up alive and well in hong kong and before the timer ran out we see tons of gundams fighting over hong kong with their bits and pieces raining down on the bay
    theres no point not spoiling something most people will never be able to read due to the language barrier
  the new gundam on the left
  turns into a giant axe
  that bolt crash can use    oh and toro gundam got upgraded but i cant find the page it got drills or something
  every page from the final battle is littered with ridiculous gundams theres even a rubix cube one at one point
  gurren lagann  next to neo israels dreidel gundam  this is madness
  oh and another change is that jester zeus and cobra gundams all join the final battle since they didnt die in lantau island
  the point of the regeneration abilities was to restore the earth from the devastations of war
        those are some horrifically overfiltered scans why the fuck do people do this i miss the days when shit would actually get scanned properly without being raped by two dozen filters and destroying image quality
  easier to filter than clean
  no it isnt its a lot fewer steps needed to just clean up a manga scan than to filter it multiple times
  rushed ending but overall fun and comfy
  the best au story desu
   best version of dragon ball z ever
    its saint seiya not dragon ball imagawa outright says as much in the dvd extras
its in my top 4 after msg zeta and stardust easily the best non uc show sure it has issues with reusing footage but everything else makes up for it     is there any country that doesnt enjoy this absurd show because of their countrys representation i think even iraq has to find it funny
  is that a fucking dreidal
  nice wig godzilla
  didnt know that actually im suddenly very interested in saint seiya
  thats the entire point him choosing rain signifies his character development from a hot blooded meathead who only cares about fighting to a person who can actually interact with others as a normal human being its the fitting end to an arc that has been happening the whole show
  yeah its a character arc but not one that is easy for people to root for
  why cant you be happy for rain she deserves this
  i agree
  all she did was be useless and annoying
  looks like it and next to it is the super robot combiner gundam
  the only person capable of keeping up the gundams maintenance majority of the time even when nearly bedridden  the person who knows she cant do much as a pilot but still suits up holds out long enough to stand in until domon gets there  useless
  yeah after just being a detriment she then becomes a passive plot device
  this is bullshit stalker does not even exist on the same realm as any of the other characters theres no way he could be
  one of my favorite of the 50ep tv shows good fun with cool robots and not weighed down convoluted melodramatic plot also one of my favorite main girl in the franchise     
  i really dont know what shes sees in him overlooking that shes just a thinlywritten love interest but if they make each other happy in the end im all for it
  also one of my favorite main girl in the franchise    who else is even in the running
  booty  in a good way
  what the fuck is that thing with a boat for a lower body its like some sort of viking getter
  tiffa and uh    well tiffas some good competition
  just think allenby gets to be the obnoxious auntie that lets the kids get away with shit their parents never do and drinks too much at parties
  g gundam would benefit from a couple compilation movies pretty well
  you spelled chibodee wrong
  that is in fact the viking gundam the oars are heat weapons
  where you god now don quixote
    forgetting natasha
  thats official hnnng
    i think its less that noone thought why not put these fights on the moon and more that the people in charge just didnt care plus the earth is more visually interesting and has more stuff you can use to spice up fights in various ways i wouldnt even say the tournament only being a second half thing undermines it really since many tournaments have knockout rounds for entry before placing all the winning teams in to a more formal tournament that is played out on a bigger stage thats all it really is a knockout round to weed out the weaker units and ensure theres only the stronger more interesting folks left by the time the show has an audience         easily    since when is falling through the atmosphere to impact on the earth easy        while i can certainly see why someone would characterize it as bullshit id actually say but my other hand can do the same special attack too is actually one of the least bullshit shonen attacks i can think of its still dumb but im not sure bullshit is the word id choose i guess more than that that fight between domon and chibodee is the highlight of g gundam to me because its two protagonists fighting for equally compelling reasons both of whom need to win or their motivations go up in smoke id definitely prefer the fight be more even and less silly in its climax but at the same time i love the setup and emotion of the entire fight so i dont care that much
  what would it take to make that thing legitimately scary
    speak for yourself i find it very easy to root for id have been happy which ever he chose honestly but i thought both were decent characters and dont really care about shipping so much as that the execution of whatever option the show does is good and the climax of domon and rains arc is fantastic
  couldnt it also encourage emigration to the colonies as the planet gets progressively more ruined government was zeon all along
  no chibodee is the weed dealing uncle
  make it like the z fundamental ones with new/remastered animation also bring domons dub va back
    put master asia behind the controls then give him a beanie hat and call it a day
i liked it for the most part
  its one of my favorite gundam shows its certainly one of the best aus for sure
  i wish theyd gone further with the evil gundam at the end they could have gone full cosmic horror    other than that it was a fun super robot series
  natasha was not the main girl
  sayla was interesting in origin cant say much for her in msg though     honestly i often find gundams side girls to be more interesting than the main girls noin is chief among them for me also brightwithtitties from seed
  who else is even in the running    nina but mostly because she triggers the autists around here which makes her a great subject matter for trolling and general shit posting on some easy targets of /m/
the only problem with g gundam is its diehard fans 90 of people that claim its the best gundam series havent even watched any other gundam series
        waitt snce when have we had sscans of this link to the rest
  cecilys pretty good shes levelheaded doesnt change her mind every five minutes and can pilot well enough to fight alongside seabook in the final battle
  but my other hand can do the same special attack too  that was how he won against sai saici  he won against chibodee with the god shadow technique
  which manga is this
  canadian here    youre forgetting the belligerent canadian goose gundam
    yea i didnt realize that until some time later my mistake
  one of the greatest gundam series of all time
romulan warbirds are epic
  rough start to the thread dont have any romulan stuff maybe this is close enough
i wish they would have kept the klingons stealing the bird of prey from the romulans subplot in star trek 3 the ship makes much more sense that way
  klingons developing their own tech makes no sense
  you know one thing i love about star trek it canonized the entire concept of the kit bash ship    since the dawn of plastic models people have been gluing random parts together and going haha neat    half the ships in star trek were built exactly like that take an excelsior model a reliant model a couple felt tip pens glue it all together fuckyeah new starship    i love that the ship in your pic is clearly just a miranda class primary hull  refit enterprise booms and nacelles and somehow it looks perfect like it could really exist in the star trek universe because half the other canon star trek ships were built exactly the same way
  id be curious to hear the original reason for the dderidex class being hollow    my guess would be the ship was always supposed to be powered by a micro singularity and originally this singularity was supposed to be confined in the middle of this hollow space    but i guess there was no way to really show that on screen especially so early in tngs run
  to be fair all the expanded material suggests the klingons adapted the technology of conquered races the only reason they got into space was because they were invaded by aliens
  one of the things i liked in star trek online was that when a romulan ship experiences a corebreach it implodes on itself
  enterprise develops the klingons in a way that makes it make more sense basically they have a caste system if youre not born into the warrior caste then youll just have to do something more constructive with your life and this is why there are klingon scientists and engineers
10 rapidfire photon torpedo launchers
  man  the pillar of autumn sure looks bland 
  the unsc frigate for me was love at first sight but the entire rest of their lineup doesnt really do it for me    well the spirit of fire is ok    anyway precursor dreadnought best nought
the warbird is the best trek ship
  whyd it have to be so big i wouldnt think of romulans as being the shock and awe big ships guys
  maybe its a result of them using a singularity for a power source
she might be fairly obscure at least i think so but i love this mining vessel turned warship
   she may have flaws but shes got it where it counts
  my nigga
  i really love the compact antiborg starships
  what is this a steamrunner for ants
  surprisingly cool
i heard yall like balance so i got rid of it
  i used to hate the nacelles only being attached to the wedge saucer at one end as it made me think they might break off or something but the design has grown on me over the years
  are we talking about the best star trek ships out there or the best ships in general
  just best ships in general though star trek has some of the best ships in general anyway
    alright in that case i nominate yamato
  going where my heart will take meh
  not having faith of the heart  stardate 2k18  shiggity higgity
i love this design from sto its like an inbetween of a klingon cruiser and a birdofprey
  the refit that never happened was goat
the only thing i cant stand about star trek is the lack of actual articulating turrets  i know the phaser banks can shoot in all sorts of directions but it just isnt as dramatic as watching the barrel of a turret turn towards you  what do people think of balltype phaser mounts
  oh shit that looks dope
  the idea was to do that 5th season or something but then the show was cancelled it was in an official calendar iirc and you could buy a model kit of it
  at first the theme was annoying but by ten episodes in i was singing along
i always liked that false reconstruction of the voyager
always been a fan of asgard ships from stargate  shame there arent any big pictures of them  
  i hate star trek because they dont use retarded turrets  yeah and i hate star trek because they dont use swords
  thats what really happened the events as voyager depicted them were just janeways versions of things
  chill dude i never said i hated star trek   youre taking my interest in turrets waaay too personally
also best girl
  oops forgot the image
  i dig the rear thrusters
  something i love about the basic tos enterprise design is how it blends the alien and the familiar basing a future human starship around the visual of a flying saucer was genius and in this shot from tomorrow is yesterday the enterprise really looks like a classic ufo
  enterprise had turrets im pretty sure the 2009 movie also had a bunch on the kelvin including ball mount phasers which looked pretty damn good
  ah youre right and they dont look half bad
    these turrets right looking good i wonder if theyre retractable  i ought to watch the film again
  i have zero issues with this and it is now my headcanon
  the uss hood refit has turrets  ill have to fork over some cash if i want a larger image than this though
  thosere the ones i had in mind yeah forgot the 2009 enterprise had them as well as  posted the platform theyre on does look mobile in some capacity though i dont think we ever see that happen    for all its problems including copious lens flare i do like the movie and its opening is probably my favourite among all of trek
  canon only art how crazy can we get here
  the designs in the film were top notch it would have been cool if they put out more supplementary material though  id love to peer over the blueprints for the kelvintimeline enterprise    maybe some of the guns popout elite dangerous style
  just because im ridiculing you doesnt mean im mad chill dude
    retractable turrets always seemed impracticable to me all those moving parts means more to go wrong you want to be a gun short cause something jammed
  the kelvin was great  rip in peace taken too soon
  indeed it do
  looks like shed be at home in the mirror universe
  im so upset we never got to see that fight instead the entd gets taken out by a shitty bird of prey
  well the reasoning in elite was to keep the ship reasonably aerodynamic while in atmosphere  though that would also mean youre especially vulnerable while cruising planetside    i wont be exceptionally susceptible to jamming the disappearing gun is an old proven concept   think of it as a turret/barbette setup sitting upon hydraulic lifts  granted the additional machinery required to both extend and cover the mount might be space/weight better spent elsewhere
  it wont be
good tastes in this thread  let me add some more
  also the deployment scenes look cool  
  most elegant imperial ship
  what do you think of the new one
  toot toot  democracy coming through bitch
small wily and vicious true to its namesake
  that heresy of a series should be banished to basketball hell
  even the new hyperion
  neat
  looks overdesigned there are a bunch of weird curves just because  designs are far more elegant
  yeah i can get that they really did go overboard on some of the details   though in a way that sort of extravagance fits the empire  most of the average nameless ships are alright with me   the spear portion of the ship however could use some trimming  there shouldnt be anything jutting out of the ships primary envelope
  primarily these components
  its not a bad design overall but i like the older design a fair bit better
  phalanxclass  im not entirely sure if its canon
  fair enough
  i can never unsee the grinning pompadour man
  the new imperial battleship looks like that
  unrelated but why does japan glorify the yamato so much its pretty much one of the worst ships ever built
  new paint or old paint
  its a national pride sort of thing it was a symbol of japans great power and its defeat was seen as an omen of doom the end of the empire    after that i think it became linked with perseverance or something
  i dunno but they love it enough to dedicate a museum to it  wouldnt mind visiting it myself either
  forgot the image
  it was big  like really big  and biggerer is gooderer
  nationalistic pride to japan its a symbol of the virtue and nobility of their nation and their race remember that they generally dont think that they did anything bad in ww2 so they romanticize the hell out of the idea of a big warship bravely sailing out on an ultimately doomed mission in what they see as a noble struggle its the same reason why you get stuff like the nazis being portrayed positively in japan they see the axis losing ww2 in the same way that the us south sees the confederacy losing the civil war basically noble underdog fighting bravely for what is right falls in battle against overwhelming odds
  us south sees the confederacy losing the civil war basically noble underdog fighting bravely for what is right falls in battle against overwhelming odds  only kkk members see it that way everyone else in the south thinks they were idiots
  
  awesome classic ship design     ugly garbage
  the pillars do give it a classy feel  is there any merchandise for the new thesis
  what are teh anal beads for
this counts right
  i guess
  what scale is that 1/4
  1/10 my buckaroonie
my alltime favorite
  goddamn that boat was huge
  yeah which only makes me harder when i think about how easily the americans sank that fucker
trek   klingon bird of prey preferably the larger variants   romulan valdore style warbird   uss enterprise e   uss vengeance   ferengi dkoraclass marauder   romulan dderidex style warbird
  crusher joe has such great designs
vesta is one of my all time faves its a perfect mix of classic federation design and new advanced warp capabilities it would be the perfect hero ship for a postvoy exploration based series that will never happen
  im so sick of these starfleet ships with no neck its horrible
narenda iii never forget
  my favorite trek ship is the original tos enterprise saucer section    thats right im gonna be a sperg about this    i dont like the drive section    in my head i imagine a whole tv series based around a constitution class saucer section that gets marooned in a globular cluster after its drive section has to be jettisoned due to a core breach    in globular clusters stars can be much less than a light year apart and interstellar travel at impulse speed would actually be possible    furthermore the constitution class has 3 big 1950s style landing legs and can actually land on planets its never been depicted but the original designer included them and theyve been standard on a whole lot of trek ships ever since despite never being shown on film    flying saucers just kick so much ass
  ambassadors are truly classy vessels
  there was a scene considered for the ending of star trek the motion picture where after vger joins with deckard and it has its galactic orgasm and vger disappears the 3 klingon ships digitized at the beginning of the movie reappear reconstructed like they were and they start attacking the enterprise during the battle the saucer section separates and does battle with the klingons
  romulan warbirds are epic fail  i disagree
one of the things i always liked about trek designs were that the federation ships werent sleek sexy warships they were science vessels that just kept getting into fights because the galaxy is a big scary place full of doomsday weapons and angry gods and klingons    it just feels wrong to have aerodynamic federation ships
  to be fair the borg and the dominion really made them rethink that policy
  honestly crusade wasnt nearly as bad as i was told to expect
  thats one of the reasons i dont hold the latter seasons of ds9 in very high regard the dominion conflict doesnt have a great payoff the fleet battles feel vastly inferior to b5 the semiserialization makes the pacing garbage and there are fewer standalone stories and it comes at the cost of the federations whole mindset there are plenty of places i can go if i want stories about humanity making hard decisions in a toothandnail struggle against alien invaders there arent many places i can go to get a serious look at the fantasy of a humanity which figures it all out
approx 100 of the ships in the thread assume gravity somehow points downwards and thrust doesnt affect the crew which flares up my autism
  artificial gravity and inertial dampers problem solved
  thought this wassupposed to be sci fi not fantasy
  the only difference is if you say magic/monsters/realms or technology/aliens/planets
magic artificial gravity is for pussies i like ships with rotational gravity components
  thats overly simplistic i think its reasonable to use the following definitions fantasy is simply a setting in which different things exist science fiction puts focus on the different thing and on how it interacts with the old things in that sense science fiction is a specific subset of fantasy and it can never quite escape the realm of fantasy if it could it would be a textbook on actual physical principles    when a wizard forges a flaming sword thats a different thing when the wizard uses the flaming sword as a cheap source of steam power hes thinking about how the magic interacts with the mundane world and the story shifts slightly more towards science fiction that it might otherwise be when theres an entire chapter of the book devoted to describing the imaginary principles behind flaming swords focusing the readers attention there were definitely in science fiction territory    when geordi and ro still breath air and stand upright despite not being in the same dimension as the enterprise thats fantasy when the artificial gravity goes out in undiscovered country and the klingon bodies float around thats more science fiction    from that perspective its sort of reasonable to be annoyed by waving away artificial gravity its especially fantastic since it gets even less explanation than the ftl the teleportation system and the universal translator it also has a solution just film a few scenes on wires or make some part of the ship rotate from an audience perspective ignoring budget its tantalizingly easy to solve so it sticks out like a sore thumb
  no one gives a single fuck about that shit
i never thought tom cruise would get an even comfier ride than his f14 but he did
  isnt a good third of the white male population of the south made of kkk members
  no
i miss galactica i hope we get a new movie or series in the future tied to the 1979 or 2004 series or completely new
  id love to see a new series that would combine the good from the old 78 series aesthetics pulp scifi atmosphere and the good from the new clastrophobic character drama while cutting out the negatives both had the olds whiplashing tonal shift and the news holier then thou pretentiousness and news of the day storytelling    also keep both starbucks blonde cigar chomping ladiesman starbuck for apollos older brother figure and grouching surly bitch starbuck for her bleak worldview and narcissistic nature both were good characters and you have both for the narative make em brother and sister i guess
  one of the things i always liked about trek designs were that the federation ships werent sleek sexy warships    id argue starfleets nonshuttles tend to be quite sleek actually its stuff like the various shuttle boxes the danube runabouts which are really just shuttle 20 and ironically enough the defiant class warship that have the chunkier aspects of ufp design breaking a longstanding tradition of saucers and spoons seen in the rest of their fleet
  i feel like a lot of the sto federation designers really liked the normandys lines and ape the shit out of it all the time
  nah they have a hard on for the intrepid all the new federation ships have that retarded dildo head for a saucer
all these star trek posts  not one damn miranda class
  sorry anon all my mirandas were destroyed in the dominion war
  rebel scum
    just add mecha and we have a new series
  scum
there arent any good pictures but descent freespace had some really bitchin ships in every weight class
  freespace 2 was a great game    i tried to play freespace 1 but it was balls to the woodchipper hard    a hard mission in freespace 2 was like this is hard but i see what i need to do    a hard mission in freespace 1 was like this is hard and i dont see how i can do this    one mission wanted me to knock out an alien fighter with my 1st gen shitfighter you dont have to but the game progresses in a more favorable way if you do i tried it like 20 times couldnt even get close to destroying or disabling that alien fighter i dont see how its done
  nah they have a hard on for the intrepid all the new federation ships have that retarded dildo head for a saucer  well would you rather have the pizzacutterprise
  i just want the uss enterprise no bloody e f g or j
  careful what you wish for
    
mahkcha
i wish cbs kept the original uss discovery design i also wish they made a real star trek show but alex kutzman has ensured that will never happen
  from certain angles that discovery design looked pretty beautiful
  it also looked way more appropriate for the era

  boredom time screencaps imagination and photoshop
i love the musai and her variants
  too curvaceous for her own good  damn i like the ambassador we got but this one looked very nice
both these ships
  searching the ship names tells me its from the expanse but this is still amusing
  tfw no stolen martian gunship
  so the miners became warriors
  honestly i like it detailed but the original looks better beauty in simplicity
  soase has some really nice designs    sequel when campaign when
  ioncannon its way to victory
  ftl sensors and coms
      the expanse is so damn solid
  this is the type of overdone garbage that mamoru nagano makes
  it isnt but sadly its nowhere near b5s standard
for the guy who wanted freespace
      i played freespace for the first time when i was 8 years old it was my first videogame my young mind was so thoroughly blown away had a huge impact on my imagination
  i know the point youre talking about you just cant let up the unknown enemy is the first one to have shields and shields can regenerate if you give it any time to recover it will be invincible to the early game weapons so if you were using hit  run dogfight tactics that is why you failed only a nonstop barrage will do it
am i a faggot for preferring ships to mechs
  nah ships are cool
  one mission wanted me to knock out an alien fighter with my 1st gen shitfighter you dont have to but the game progresses in a more favorable way if you do i tried it like 20 times couldnt even get close to destroying or disabling that alien fighter i dont see how its done  by playing on ultra easy    its one of the very rare games that still holds up perfectly today as it did 19 years ago its like the super mario of space fight
  how different are the ships from the novel
im probably not the first to say this but i honestly do think the game is shit its a fucking disgrace to the name old muvluv and i dont understand how age spent 6 years working on this shit when all they did was parts of unlimited in the first act and rush the shit of the second     its hard to like it because there was so much potential here so much they couldve done but in the end they flunked it     what do you guys think
though admittedly its thanks to this game i write fanfiction now
miki thread
unlimited new game  portions were good but they felt a bit rushed    coup was trash    return to the extra world was fantastic    sadogashima and yokohama hives were good    original hive wasnt bad but did feel disappointing after all the expectations and buildup killing of all the characters one by one in quick succession felt cheap too
  i agree with most of these but coup did give us some glorious shit like this        and the masskilling really paid off at the return to final extra
not to mention the decision to introduce sumika late into the story really threw things off for me    i get they confessed to each other during the ptsd arc but even still that doesnt explain why i had to sit through that almostrape scene in the bedroom with meiya     its like they wanted takeru and meiya together and placed all kinds of scenes and little moments with the two but just didnt do it       wonder why any ideas
    anon the nearrape scene was supposed to tip you off that takeru was completely off his rockers    if you actually take that as some sort of shipping material i legitimately have no idea what to say to you
  retard
  its like they wanted takeru and meiya together  i mean thats what unlimited is for where meiya is not so subtly pushed as the preferred love interest sumika practically deserves takeru after the unlimited scenarios where she stays a brain in a jar
  i cant disagree with sumikas late intro being an issue it also didnt help that when she was finally reintroduced she barely had any interaction at all with anyone not takeru she barely talks to kasumi and has almost no direct interaction with the valkyries before shit hits the fan the game made a big deal about meiya and sumikas friendship by using the hot spring scene but then they dont even talk in alt    also the ntr
  alternative was basically unlimited sumika route  only thing i thought felt rushed during the whole course was the original hive battle
i want to make yuuhi think i ever loved her  i want to ntr yuuhi with meiya
  definitely was an issue theres a reason getting noble confidanted became a meme sumika was to be loved because we were told she was to be loved which actually caused a hatedom to grow around her among fans takeru just wants her back 100 the moment he knows she exists even though this is 180 from what we saw in unlimited with him forgetting about her its such a whiplash
  which actually caused a hatedom to grow around her among fans  you mean the fauxfan retards who skipped extra and told other retards to do so too    the only people who like meiya are those autists and lafiel fans who had mental breakdowns over the wait for a new banner of the stars anime
  takeru just wants her back 100 the moment he knows she exists even though this is 180 from what we saw in unlimited  as i recall though he spends the first half of the story asking if anyone knows her and then just before the scene where the girl he ended up with was leaving on a jet plane he literally says a goodbye to her thankful that she didnt exist in this world the whole kasumi ending sequence revolved around reminding takeru of sumika as well    people saying sumika appearing out of nowhere and becoming the center of the story are just fucking salty in my opinion could alternative be better sure but what would you change to make it so if you say you wanted all the girls to survive that becomes a scenario like how fmp fans hate the alternate endings presented in the fmp iv game which everyone surviving some may like it but it changes the meaning of the story at the end
  different anon i preferred meiya in extra by pretty damn long margin stealing her from the wedding was better than anything in sumikas forgettable route kei was the best by the way and the only character i found worse than sumika was chizuru dont assume everyone has to like your waifu
  chizurus route  bad    the only thing objectively bad about it was the outofplace sex scene  typical taste of nobleconfidantfags
  best scene  more like overrated scene
  kei best  only anons with a test for getting ass whipped will go for her shes purely a fuck and forget chara
  sounds middleroad would be better with some of the girls ending up dead or having to separate and possible escape but then what about the meeting takeru has at the hive they are gonna die there anyway right
were coming into november you guys ready for a week of hellish lacrosse practice
i knew the nearrape scene was a sign that takeru wasnt well but i never meant it to say it was shipping material    i was trying to say that throughout the game and ive gone back my old playthrough meiya was constantly shoved to the forefront with takeru     she volunteered to help him look for sumika when he first spoke of her shes the one who debates with takeru about the mt tengen evacuation she and ayamine are the main focus characters of the coup arc shes the one who asked takeru if hes alright after his beating from the two asshole lieutenants and dont forget shes got more cgs than anyone else at least concerning the main five and her ending leads into kasumis confession at the end     so from my understanding her role was bigger than anyone else on the team she got more screentime and plays a integral part of the story     am i wrong
  am i wrong  yes because sumika is the hidden boss takeru tries to find out about her and every night he says he wishes he could see her at the end kasumi reminds him of her and hits him so hard he couldnt be bothered to see the girl pregnant with his child off into space
  just like how minmay is the true heroine of macross right
  youre not but you forget that while all this is going on takeru is doing nothing but thinking of sumika and wanting to go back to sumika meiya does have a large role in both the story and for takerus development but sumika is the entire driving force for takeru the entire game
i was merely pointing the obvious and yes takeru was thinking of sumikas well being but even so meiya shouldve at least fought for him the two of them couldve developed a bond that they sorely needed but no they die so i guess im desperate am i     ill be honest and say that i like sumika but they really butchered her character development partially because she was introduced very late into the game and the games structure being fucking idiotic because of the story replaying itself in the first act sumikas introduction comes out of nowhere and wastes time on matters that should have been handled earlier had that happened the casts relationship with sumika wouldve been more believable but again no they all die feels ensue and frankly i look back wondering why the fuck i was staying up all night playing this shit     time fucking wasted     your counterpart
i feel like i should have dropped this during muv luv i didnt like any of the characters i dont mind one note characters if theyre done well but i dont think i felt strongly about any of the girls
  i wouldnt call muvluvs characters too good in terms of writing but they definitely have enough time exposure and backstory to not be onenoted characters yes even literal plot devices like sumika shes a blob of cliches all rolled in one but she is lovable especially with all the time spent in extra  the only single character i dont understand how anybody can like her is mikoto
  i liked dude mikoto in extra
who is the el hermano of muv luv
  sounds like you are in the second stage of ptsd suggest you just walk away and experience some life outside maybe itll all make sense down the line    trust me youre not the first to come here all fire and brimstone when actually all you wanted was a hug    
chizuru is best
  much like minmay its meiyas part of the story that dominates the theme of the game and thats the basis for every other thing in the franchise even though that inherently involves losing the romance yui and irisdina really are recycled versions of that character in terms of forcing the nationalism thing    its funny because yoshida was surprised foreigners like meiya but i dont think he realizes its not because they actually ever really understood the point of her but just western harem eccentrism
  western harem eccentrism  what do you mean by this
  the west has a very strong tendency to pick the secondary or seemingly less likely heroine and cheer for them because they dislike standard japanese harem/love triangle cliches that are much more endearing in their home market for cultural reasons assuming there isnt some overwhelming writing or design issue with one of the two occasionally this isnt actually at odds with japan because of said writing or design issues or a casting choice eg kana hanazawas resume has a long list of clear underdog girls that were massively popular in japan as well and as much as a lot of people hate louise and shana their rivals are so god awful almost nobody likes them this tendency has gotten weaker in recent years because with 8 billion lns on the market you see more gimmicky subversions to try to stick out    sumika is very much the kind of loud overbearing possessive and mildly tsundere childhood friend archetype with a ridiculously perfect rival from that time period that tends to trigger this
  plot devices like sumika shes a blob of cliches  as opposed to everyone else not being cliches even though the games genre in japanese was originally literally listed as cliche romance adv    extra is literally a fucking parody of shit like love hina you idiot
tempted to buy muvluv know nothing about it other than its /m/ somehow anything i should be aware of/go in knowing
  it starts off as a 30 hour parody of harem stuff like love hina filled with cliches which is necessary to enjoy the series autists will claim otherwise theyre the sort of retards who say they watched gundam when all they did was watch battle scenes on youtube     everyone knows about it anyway at this point but the /m/ stuff was originally a twist that was hidden from players
  shit distaste
  huh i thought i recalled him forgetting about her by the end i could be way off base there though because kasumi did remind him of sumika in unlimited and no its nothing about all the girls surviving muv luv is not about that and would be much worse if it did that people just wanted takeru to have more conflicted romantic feelings in alternative
  on the day hes supposed to see off his pregnant wife forever hes literally still talking to her in his head
  i loved the buildup with the /m/ game takeru constantly plays and ends up in the os development subplot which is my favorite thing from alternative and i wished they pushed more in other works they should still have the os even after takeru is gone after all instead its completely forgotten but all mechs now move without the limitations of preos days
  dont skip extra
  that moment when i realized valgernon is based on an actual arcade game series from sega only after having read ml and mla almost years earlier  guess that serves me right for being a nintendo fanboy but god damn i feel like i missed out big time in the late 90s and early 2000s
  posts on /m/  doesnt know virtual on  i bet you never played armored core either
  i wasnt posting on /m/ when i first read the ml visual novels so no i wasnt aware of armored core either mind you this was many years ago long before ml discussions became stale shitposting generals
second stage of ptsd no dude im just in the middle of writing a fanfic so i have to go back and revisit this game its for research materials and such     besides the yuusha series is better anyway been watching that
namefagging  oh man
  missed out big time     not really thanks to digital piracy and emulation its all there for you to enjoy
  i know about those thats how i tried it out and became familiar with it still not the same as playing it in the arcade with other people though
  only speaking for yourself faggot before playing extra i liked sumikas design the best but by the time i finished my first route meiya had already won me over  meiya is way better than the fucking childhood friend who felt entitled to the mc just for spending the longest time with him and not confessing
  fauxfan retard who skipped ex detected
ill be honest     extra was okay not great but not terrible     i think we can all agree that the pacing was shit shit hands down no doubt about it though this is an age game so what did i expect     unfortunately ive only played one route so my knowledge is very limited however speaking from that experience i dont think i wanna go back for another round i fell asleep during the ending and frankly doing that a second time just aint worth it     plus some of the hscenes are 30 minutes long thats like watching stage porn
thinking anything about this game is rushed    vn fans frighten me
30 min h scenes  nigger now i know youre not even playing the same game theres like 30 mins of h scenes across all the routes playing on auto
  shes certainly the most heavily marketed in the original no debating that
  she got real old though also probably the first ntr girl
final hive needed to be expanded upon  killing characters with less personal relevance to mc was a mistake allow a few of them to make it to final hive but kill 2 earlier not class rep killing her so soon after the coup would be a bit cliche basically spread the deaths of the main squad out further  i otherwise thoroughly enjoyed mla its never near 10/10 but more 8/10
  chotto
  the crappy ones feel like a fucking hour
  arent good sex scenes supposed to feel longer instead  your retarded ass is just finding excuses to whine about now
  context check
  the fact that tank top can stretch that far and not break activates my autism
  oh yeah waitll he posts the next cg
am i the only retard here who is okay with sumika winning considering how much she has suffered but personally thinks that meiya is the better girl  both are good girls but meiya just checks more of my figurative boxes personalitywise
  sumika is olve to me extra soured my view of meiya unlim/alt did help improve meiya but not as best romantic interest
  extra soured my view of meiya    how so
  well
  well
  answers dammit
  best cutscene best girl
  meiyas not my personal favorite but shes still superior to sumika in almost every regard shes the only good thing about ayamines soap opera trainwreck in extra and to such a degree that i felt a bit disappointed that her actual routes were less good at endearing you to her than how she takes her rejection
    mostly agree with both of you but ill take any development of this cute incompetent oneesan i can get
  objectively the best muvluv waifu for everyone
  did she take the idiom cutting in line too literally at the burg stand
  no i feel the same way meiya is the better girl but sumika is the better fit for takeru if that makes sense    i disagree with the guy claiming that people only like meiya because of some shallow notion of western eccentrism i can see why yoshida would be suprised that we liked her because she was made to embody japanese specific cultural values that ought to be alien to us but i think its more that people like her in spite of those things than because of them shes just a good person completely outwith her cultural baggage and thats what makes her endearing
  meiyas extra ending was cringe total cringe  imagine unironically writing and then he busted into the wedding in a sports limo chased by helicopters busted through the front door using the family heirloom and keked some aristocrat at his own wedding by fucking meiya so well she pledged herself to him on the spot  this is my problem with meiya as a whole actually everything that is most cringe about the original trilogy is exemplified in her eg very unsubtle pandering muh nippon generally taking ridiculous things too seriously and shes by far the biggest mary sue in the original trilogy too  what i like about sumika ayamine and shekoto is that theyre all more understated than that well sumika not so much i guess but shes got a lot of flaws that make her a more human character
  eh im a sumikafag but you got to understand that muvluv was created over a decade ago and it was deliberate in its intention to poke the fun out of all the tropes in vns of that age
  most of extra was purposely written to be cheesy if fits that meiya being one of the two main heroines has the cheesiest ending in the game  ultimately the game shows you that each of the girls have flaws and illogical sides some being more understandable than others
  generally taking ridiculous things too seriously  thats exactly what youre doing with your cringe ranting you insufferable underage retard
  it was deliberate in its intention to poke the fun out of all the tropes in vns of that age    this seems largely lost on most who criticize it for said tropes
you know whats weird     the fact that early on the game emphasized on the player making alterations to the events of unlimited but then abandoned that gimmick after the coup arc    i felt the game had an idea when it came to player choice but it wasnt utilized to its fullest potential     for fucks sake the only choices that actually affect the outcome of the ending is when you visit one of the girls after marimos death    the fuck
  i see it as being called alternative because its one more alternative route to add on to the eleven already in unlimited  besides that making alterations to unlimited plan started to become less and less feasible as more and more changes were made and takerus knowledge of the future became unreliable
you were tricked into thinking a romance vn was actually a mecha vn     for real though relating to s00mika i wish the franchise looked a bit more into the idea of having to basically become nonhumans in order to win the war it would have given plenty of opportunity to create characters similar to pic related
    i thought that the narrative goal of the coup was supposed to indicate that things had gone far off rails enough that trying to use predictions from ul was no longer feasible
yes that may have been true but surely player choice couldve been utilized more throughout the whole game     what do you think
    oh the game definitely could have utilized more player choices its just that the coup arc wasnt a baitandswitch narration i feel that alternatives relatively linear pace may have been partially deliberately chosen due to the way the plot was written    had the production been less frenzied alternative might have had actual path branches with different plot outcomes eg legit bad ends instead of just variations but we may never know      spoiler  pray that the cookie gets a sudden windfall of hot bux so that he can sit down long enough to write exogularity 3
to further pile this trash bin with shit i have an outrageous question for you all    was there really any point of introducing the valkyries it just seemed they were put in the story to serve merely cannon fodder     my guess was kouki trolling fans or nobody knew what to do with them     btw best girl is hayase
  pray that the cookie gets a sudden windfall of hot bux so that he can sit down long enough to write exogularity 3  implying he wont just squander it all on another car of the week
  btw best girl is hayase  the fact that you say this proves that there was a point in introducing them it was fanservice pandering whatever you want to call it putting in characters from other age vns plus they needed someone to serve as an experienced leader for the main cast since it would be just too unbelievable for them to instantly go from training to the best pilots in the entire army
holy shit a friend of mine said the exactly same thing     i suppose all i wanted was for the valkyries to be fleshed our more you know give us the time to spend with them flesh them out more fuck there were two original characters never before seen in ages games     this is what happens when you rush a story you dont have enough time for the audience to know the characters only one chapter gave us time to interact with him     am i going crazy or is kouki a fucking idiot
  am i going crazy  nope as a matter of fact you already are if youre making a thread blogging about your experience with a visual novel most people have either read an eternity ago or were never going to read anyway while thinking your opinion means anything  shouldve tried this on reddit or somewhere else because nobody takes namefags let alone tripfags seriously on this site
  t 30something and single  shit taste indeed  just considering these girls it goes as such  ayamineshekotochizuru no glassesmeiyachizuru glassestama
good grief i think this shit has gone long enough     closing forum now
would that be better
  chizuru no glasseschizuru glasses
what do you guys think  i hope youll spend more time with the things you like rather than force through something you consider sucking i always support people who quit shit they dont like in favour of shit they like  âge also sucks at making business they were riding on kgnes fame
  really is that true     i did not know that
  âge also sucks at making business    its like screwing over your customer base isnt a good idea after all
  is it because of their infamous trolling
  
  i think  has a question
  is pic somehow related
you know the meme aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaageee thats what i was talking about
  certainly there was a reason that got started
  anyone
chizuko hoshino  va for mana   chizuko also did voice work in the following   of particular interest is the erotic temptress oav episode 5 where she voices newly appointed maid whos name is maya  made me kek admirably    shame she didnt do more characters in anime her va work in ml is fucking amazing
  so she plays her own sister i dont get it
  whyd you put her surname in all caps
  her va work in ml is fucking amazing    how so
  because
  replay all of the ml but this time pay attention mana how she talks and behaves in extra then in unlimited and finally alternative by the time you finish alternative mana becomes like old an friend who you are happy to see last couple of times takeru talkes to her are just so good like pic related
  hey mana it would be great if you could go into the hive with us since youre like the best pilot in this vn  nah dude just take our mechs lmao  i cant even remember what her fucking excuse was but it was dumb
  sounds more like something attributable to writing
  i cant even remember what her fucking excuse was but it was dumb  i not surprised you dont considering she never never said any of what you claim rather it went something like this    meiya lt can we have your and your squads mechs  mana only if you let me and my squad join you on your suicide mission  meiya no you cant come you must protect denka plus us and un will be suspicious if you came  mana fine you can have them i was going to give them to you anyway but i wanted to see your resolve  this is this the gist of the talk get your facts sorted next time before posting       oh well yes without a doubt her character is well written her vas delivery of her lines just makes mana even better
no  however marken part2 was so bad and lazy it ruined ml completely
  part2    
  denka  whats that
  my lord
  more like who  very top of my image
  explain
    not him but the second schwarzesmarken vn took a pick your own canon approach by not explicitly saying which of the three routes is the canon one and was written in such a way that it left a very bad aftertaste to some
  written in such a way that it left a very bad aftertaste to some    how so
  it makes contradictory behaviors equally valid and the results as well  theo can show personal initiative be heroic and lead the rebellion to victory or show less initiative and heroism than nameless background grunts its all the same same applies to his treatment of lise personal beliefs and actions during the rebellion they can be all over the place and matter little in the end as the final result is the same  katia can die shortly after giving her speech or live to be the leader of the post rebellion gdr its all the same and the speech is always a deus ex machina by the way or diabolus ex machina in the one route it gets her killed  iris can endorse torture and killing of civilians as legitimate necessities of war or not its all the same to the point she would have joined the government side again had others not stopped her  beatrix can be outraged by collateral damage and the killing of civilians or gleefully engage in it its all the same or mutiny against her superiors and guarantee the rebellions victory it doesnt matter in the end  the 101st beatrixs unit can be pure cannon fodder or keep up and help the 666th in the most brutal laserjagd in the vn both are equally valid  the rebels can shell the shit out of berlin to win or not its all the same 
  i wonder if that was a result of the transfer of ip ownership
is played up as an eldritch monster that makes godzilla look like a pussy  as soon as his intangibility bs is taken sway godzilla rips him apart like paper    oh no no no no no no
  did you rike it
hes tricked into a volcano   oh no oh no oh no no no
  ghidorah   jobber  sounds about par for the course
     what    godzilla didnt hurt ghidorah at all just sent him back to his home dimension    i need that gif of some demon dark lord going great now i gotta wait for some sap to summon me again
  godzilla literally punches one of his heads off
which movie was the one where ghidorah was the good guy
  ghidorah whole role is the ultimate jobber for godzilla even more so than angurus every fucking time dont forget the had to lose a head always
  gmk he was a baby orochi in that
  this ghidorah hasnt really been a threat since 1965 he never stood a chance in dam and was unceremoniously beat to death by seven monsters godzilla basically beat him on his own in godzilla vs gigan zone fighter took him down and both godzilla and mothra soloed him multiple times throughout the 90s though i guess he did throw around prepower up godzilla for a bit in final wars
  i never understood why hes always made to be godzillas nemesis when mechagodzilla has beaten godzillas ass more times and actually won at least one time i guess its because mechagodzilla hinges on being a derivative
  im surprised destoryah wasnt made a reacfruing rival since its his literal weakness come to life then again i guess that would be too op and he would get trashed a lot but yeah i always saw mecha as his better rival than ghidorah who always gets some hits then proceeds to job without much retaliation
how many times has ghidorah actually scored a victory over another monster or monsters in any media
  in the movies im pretty sure its literally zero unless you maybe count kaiser ghidorah draining godzillas energy for a few minutes necessitating humans rescuing him
  i dont recall any really i would guess one of his early appreances when he was beating the shit out of some of the monsters then proceeded to lose i think his whole profile is him coming and losing
  you could honestly say that about 90 of the monsters that godzilla fights i think you could give ghidorah a break though he usually fights more than one monster at a time
  where can i watch planet eater online
to be fair something similar happened in ultraman tiga and he was an actual lovecraft monster
  ghatanathoa is just a meat bag wit a stone beam though
  hes still surrounded by lovecraftian fluff and likely has one of the highest ultra kill counts of any ultraman monster
  nah thats hipporito seijin bar none
these are the best godzilla designs prove me wrong
  godzilla gets thicker as time passes on its amazing really
  so i didnt miss anything but not watching it in japan a few days ago    i was fucking mad i didnt get to catch gundam narrative
  if gratuitous amounts of screen time for the monsters and autistic obsession as to how theyre depicted are the most important things to you about godzilla films then yes its better that you missed it
  he beat anguirus and mothra larva when they went one on one
  heisei is best
  one is a massive and powerful but otherwise still mortal creature defeated in a desperate gambit to seal it in a volcano  the other is literally an eldritch abomination that is instagibbed by godzilla when the plot decides hes suddenly arbitrarily killable with zero effort    its almost like youre using a false equivalence to apologize for these shitty anime movies
    /m/ got the first most accurate spoilers    this shitposter from tohokingdom reposts bullshit posted by a power level faggot who couldnt understand which sister was which even when its said in the dialogue multiple times    retard
  
  i really liked the effects in that movie
  anime ghidorah is literally a shitty player using cheats to stand a chance at lasting more than 5 seconds
  ghidorah was completely fucking helpess when he had to play fair got his ass spanked kicked out of the party and ended up grounded until further notice
  someone has explained multiple times that ghidorah isnt defeated his connection to our realm is simply broken   its almost like youre intentionally lying to justify your unwarranted hatred for this trilogy
  except king jobdorah is a jobber the only time he was ever legitimately a threat was in his debut movie ever since then he shows up menacingly roars while humans comment on the evil space dragon before godzilla and sometimes mothra tear him a new asshole obligatory head loss included at least in the anime trilogy ghidorah doesnt die much better than being stomped to death by a bunch of kaiju in destroy all monsters
  judging by the trailer of king of the monsters looks like hes going to be a legitimate threat again
  you a retard   his power comes from being a literal god and a high level reality warper trying to rate him up while ignoring it is like trying to rate a wizard based on his punching power   and then again he never died merely had the connection to our universe closed and had the remnant stuck behind banished hes still interested in coming back which is while discount eren being a semi conduit for him  decides to an hero
  if there are tons of monsters in king of monsters then hes definitely getting his ass kicked again
    
  based on the leaks ive read the only monsters that actually contribute to the final battle aside from godzilla and king ghidorah are mothra and rodan rodan will become king ghidorahs bitch boy before getting btfod by mothra who in turn gets taken down by king ghidorah admittedly adult mothra is as much of a jobber as king ghidorah is     would it be correct to say that assuming that king ghidorah was sent back to his plane of reality the moment his connection with metphies was severed the remnant that was btfod by godzilla earth is similar in concept to an afterimage also when haruo became an hero did he end up living long enough to see himself become the villain
  here is a review  
  when the plot decides hes suddenly arbitrarily killable  no the rules of what tether it to godzillas world are pretty clear
  if he cant willingly transcend realities with his own power hes a low level reality warper at best
  yeah cant kill it but killing its tethers to this universe stops it is like busting up lovecraftian shit 101
  i see we have similar tastes  honorable mentions go to gmk godzilla and shin godzillamainly because i couldnt fit them
  if he gets his ass kicked the moment he cant phase through his opponents hes pretty low level
but hes not actually dead  if a monster eldrich horror or not requires a tether as a win condition then thats a genuine weakness another kaiju with situational awareness could have just destroyed the tether themselves
  ghidorah just bit godzilla and godzilla couldnt even move because he was getting all the life sucked out of him he couldnt have killed a fly in that state
  so basically godzilla varying as usual sounds like a godzilla movie to me
      per the leaks he is a decent threat able to create hurricanelevel storms just by flying around and ridiculous regeneration powers  he beats godzilla in their initial two battles and like the other guy said makes rodan his bitch after whupping him in mexico ghidorah and rodan go on to lay waste to washington dc with ghidorah awakening kaiju across the globe    the final fight in boston is mainly godzilla vs ghidorah while rodan and mothra do battle in the air ghidorah kills mothra after the latter is able to incapacitate rodan     godzilla and ghidorah are evidently either evenly matched or ghidorah is stronger as godzilla is only able to defeat him after vera farmagias character sacrifices herself to distract him  godzilla evidently savages ghidorah after gaining the first using nuclear pulses to melt most of his body and then eating his surviving head which is still alive and trying to escape godzilla incinerates it in his mouth while it tries to wriggle free
  also the outcome of the second battle between godzilla and ghidorah ends up being decided by an oxygen destroyer which almost kills godzilla but does nothing to ghidorah because of his ayy lmao nature
    yep sounds like a godzilla movie also hah lmao at nature for ghidorah    godzilla aw shit  ghidorah dude the fuck your crying over
  what happens to rodan after being incapacitated
  in the leak it says mothra incapacitates him with a hidden stinger and pretty much takes him out of the battle the next mention of him is after the battle where loads of monsters awakened by ghidorah earlier in the movie all converge on boston where they find the victorious godzilla after seeing godzilla take out ghidorah and become the new king rodan bows down in submission as all the other monsters follow suit
  any leaks on the twin
  same  it and vs biollante easily have some of the best sets of the entire series  love how despite godzillas increased size modern skyscrapers still tower over him
        death ghidorah killed the 1st 90s mothra and grand king ghidorah brutally curbstomped rainbow mothra  cretaceous ghidorah was defeated by rainbow mothra but she died doing it
  i would put 1984 the suit not the cybot above 2000 shin and especially the anime
  love the lower placement of the spines
  one of my favorite and early godzilla movies along with godzilla vs mechagodzilla and the on where he teams up with jet jaguar
official synopsis for godzilla vs kongwhich has started filming as of today    in a time when monsters walk the earth humanitys fight for its future sets godzilla and kong on a collision course that will see the two most powerful forces of nature on the planet collide in a spectacular battle for the ages as monarch embarks on a perilous mission into uncharted terrain and unearths clues to the titans origins a human conspiracy threatens to wipe the creatures both good and bad from the face of the earth forever    seems to confirm the oxygen destroyer stuff from the leaks
  dont forget who is directing
  isnt it dark lugiel since he turned every single ultraman at the time in the future into spark dolls
i thought the one he likes and the one who likes him is the younger sister why did he and the elder sister end of the two that fuck and the elder sister the one get pregnant
what about when king ghidorah appeared in a 1861 book about the american revolution    
  its basically the same as anything else that happened in this entire trilogy that being the director subverting expectations for no other reason than the mere fact of it
  he just wanted to get his dick wet
  not really  butcher actually wanted to go absolutely balls to the wall with kaiju and eldritch shit but the dude from toho overseeing him never worked on godzilla before and kept interfering with shit like do the monsters really need to fight that much or does he really need to breathe fire its silly  the was an interview transcript in the previous thread urobuchi admits that the shizuno vetoed his initial idea of godzilla vs mechagodzilla being the climax of the second movie failing that  he at least wanted the turrets that grew out of the superstructure to be mgs heads but that still got vetoed until we arrived at what we got
  isnt it taboo in japan to be so blunt about calling people out like that
  someone who actually understands japanese provided a better translation and some commentary on the interview the tone was tongue and cheek toho wanted to get away from an emphasis on monster battles try new things and expand the fandom a director unfamiliar wth tokusatsu provided the fresh perspective that toho was looking for and the core elements of the franchise were questioned during the development process urobuchi mentioned his goal was to get back to where the series started humanity     as for my personal opinion city on the edge of battle and the planet eater from what i know about it so far are among the few godzilla movies that get anywhere near the spirit of goji54 and i have yet to see any substantial critique of them to explains the overly negative reaction theyve received besides not delivering on the action fans have to come to expect of godzilla movies
  dragon inhabits the void between dimensions  dxd
  i have a feeling that kotm ghidorah will be fucking brutal
  great taste anon    never understood people that put godzillas suits after vs mothra in their favorites theyre horrible
  whats bothers me the most is the lore of this universe is really fucking great and the movies that are set after are just boring  they shouldve made a trilogy based on godzilla destroying whole countries and kaijus
  either that or it will be the biggest job in western monster cinema in recorded historyand thats even taking godzilla 98
why was koizumi the best director of photography in this series
  he was great but kosuke yamada and yoichi manoda gives him a run for his money
if anyone cares a couple of threads ago i shared my folder of whichever godzillarelated essays and documents i could find seriously fascinating read for anyone really     i added another one i found so im sharing the link again    
  this tohokingdom retard  that japanese friend if he even exists spent a paragraph explaining the nuances of pro wrestling in japanese while ignoring how kaiju puroresu is a fucking slang term in tokusatsu fandom that has nothing to do with the pile of shit he was spewing
post cringe  
      thanks anon huge kaiju fan i despise this over reliance on cgi though
  tongue and cheek  please learn english
plot synopsis for godzilla vs kong hints at a bigger threat    team up boys
  city on the edge of battle  anywhere near the spirit of goji54  it felt nothing like it to me if anything it reminded me of 84
movie released
  how are 84 and coteob anything alike
  in a time when monsters walk the earth humanitys fight for its future sets godzilla and kong on a collision course that will see the two most powerful forces of nature on the planet collide in a spectacular battle for the ages as monarch embarks on a perilous mission into uncharted terrain and unearths clues to the titans origins a human conspiracy threatens to wipe the creatures both good and bad from the face of the earth forever
  i imagine desetroyah is gonna make an appearance as a way to show how humanity made the most powerful and dangerous titan by accident
  these numbers go really well to that description
  i cant wait to see this
do you think were gonna have another mothra in the legendary films for once will the twin survive
when the fuck are people gonna share their copies of kkvg in 4k and the human vapor in hd
  another mothra  another  i dont think this one counted
btfos your mc
can someone explain to me what is going on with the creator and saying that its the fans fault for not accepting change and he want a more general fanbase
  
      the creator said that he and one of the other directors wanted to do a more classicstyle godzilla film in some respectsas in a giant mechagodzilla fight with godzilla earth but toho cockblocked them
  get earthd
here are some godzilla gijinka
next ghidorah
and that is all
  more art of anime ghidorah would be cool
  hmmmm
    thanks thanks thanks
  nonsense made up by tohokingdom    the interview was translated by /m/ but they got butthurt over what it said and made up a more accurate version translated by a members japanese friend    the director said nothing like that
  new trailer  
new episode isnt out
  thanks
is it still not on torrents     damn
  man now i want a mothgirl gf
  nips aint into camrips their security actually does their job and and the penalties involved aint exactly a slap on the wrist
  god dammit it really is going to be batman vs superman
  why does he fuck the girls again
  he was pretty much indestructible though until glitter tiga
  look it up   its adam wingard    did you want to ruin my day on purpose
  did that translation even come from tohokingdom and yeah the translator added his own thoughts but he noted what wasnt from the interview and its not like his commentary isnt right
  everything mistranslated with nonsense notes showing how little he understands japan/japanese    its not like his commentary isnt right    tell me again about the nuances of pro wrestling dumbfuck
  who knows maybe this might be his first actually good film maybe he wont fuck up
    yeah but isnt it supposed to be on netflix
  my only hope is that maybe its like schumacher he made batman and robin but he also did falling down and lost boys
  i think in a month or so    yeah and batman and robin isnt much his fault kinda hard to make a good movie when the studios constantly telling you to shove more and more shit in
  wow that sucked would die for a mg x g maybe kg wouldve wtfpwn mg at the end
so what does everyone thing about the kotm plot summary thats been pretty much confirmed    i think it sounds pretty damn dope and i cant wait for it to come out
  not for a couple months just like the previous two films      it sounds pretty awesome the only thing im iffy on is the whole bowing thing
hiroyuki sawano soundtrack fits kaiju battle very well in my opinion i dont know why but the over the top orchestra mixed with synths and vocals enhances the visual of giant monsters clashing with one another
  i dont blame toho if anything i applaud their decision to try to make something different   i mean it worked great for shin even if the anime films were awful i hope they keep trying to make different things
  you know as you get older you gain weight you get that spare tire around your middle cant munch on a city without it staying with you unlike when you were young and could eat a whole tokyo and just not gain weight
  how is it confirmed
  the trailer confirmed a lot of details from the leak both big and small there is too much that has been confirmed from it that its pretty much impossible to be fake at this point
  the anime films were awful  what are you comparing them to what are some good godzilla movies
who is ready for the best ghidorah of all time
  not saying that theyre good except a few but they have the entertaining factor that is watching guys dressed as monsters destroying cities and lets be honest thats the fucking appeal of the franchise  what do the anime movies have going for them another bland and generic story with awful animation
  besides anno and kanekos scripts the writing in the anime trilogy is better than just about any postsekizawa prime godzilla script whens the last time you actually thought about the quality of writing the average godzilla film has same thing with the characters and a lot of the action is usually pretty mediocre
  depends is this director passionate about godzilla
  the millenium one where godzilla was made of ghosts was pretty good too    agree otherwise
  i honestly find the first two to be much harder to get through than even the shlockier live action films
  cretaceous ghidorah was defeated by rainbow mothra but she died doing it  rainbow mothra is leo a boy mothra he also didnt die im not sure how you even interpreted it that way if you saw the movie
  they made this anime into a toilet paper right where it belongs
  michael doherty is pretty much a godzilla fanboy
  why is that can you give specific reasons
why is the banana peel glowing is this a good omen
  im not saying that the quality of the scripts in godzilla films are good at all but as i say thats not why most people enjoy godzilla films  what are the redeeming qualities in the anime movies theyre bad and forgettable even if their script and characters as fucking bland and boring as they are are somehow better than older films  at least i can get some enjoyment with the craziness of a film like vs hedorah what do i get from watching generic anime movie 100
  so monster fights make or break these movies what do you think of return of godzilla and godzilla 2014    and what makes them bad how are these films generic what other show or movie are they like you have top notch voice acting solid writing and interesting themes that matter narratively haruo wasnt the greatest in potm but city redeemed him hes a far more balanced thoughtful character with a lot on his plate metphies is the mysterious voice of reason in his corner and the bilusaludo are reasonable antagonists their arguments make sense and they arent mustache twirling villains     vs hedorah  straight kino
  majority of people watching these movies dont care about story themes or even quality  they just want to see their action figures smack into each other for 90 minutes straight and throw a fit if even a tiny design detail aint to their liking
  aye i still remember the titanic sperging about shin nnot much gojiru despite the fact that thematically speaking he was the most godzilla a godzilla was since 1954 and even the much maligned designs the main theme behind the original  keloid scarring redone with in modern sfx with all the disgusting detail
虚淵 最初に東宝の方からリクエストがあった時に言われたのがいわゆる怪獣プロレスでないものをというオーダーだったんですドラマを描いてほしいと僕はfinal warsみたいにしましょうって言ったら速攻そっちではなくって言われました笑    kek another interview  like with the other one toho requested a human drama and no kaiju fights he told toho he wants to do something like final wars and they told him no    the autistic timeline he wrote and the novel is probably a result of this       did you watch the movie  ghidorah is timeless and cant die
  he told toho he wants to do something like final wars and they told him no  i dont blame them too many painful memories too soon its the image they want to get away from at the moment
  link to the interview  
so its the third movie right the end of the story  do the humans take back earth by blandaing up with the mothra cult or does urobutcher just kill humanity like we all knew he would
    yea i think its in good hands
  to be honest  final wars was too silly  it wont fly unles you are in a campy mood and get both dbz kinda of battles and dont mind the rubber suits
switched from white to yellow leds
            banana peel
  yes how funny and original no one has ever made that comment before about this particular figure    
  does anyone have the spoilers for this film ive just watched city on the edge of battle and need to know what happens in planet eater
  one reviews already been posted
  his power comes from being a literal god and a high level reality warper    taking the words of an insane death cult  who worship him because he destroyed their civilisation and they had to abandon their planet  seriously    hes not a god hes just another monster
  ah i double checked and saw it cheers i guess i scrolled down too quickly
  the tohokingdom review is bullshit by a retard who didnt understand the dialogue and guessed everything    /m/ got a spoiler thread search the archives
  based
isnt going from ghidorah to king king a downgrade in challenge
did someone even got the movie in camrip so that we can watch it before it hit netflix
  retard
  is bottom right anime goji might have to give 3 a shot
  bullshit by a retard    like most tohokingdom posts then
  in the end the only thing i cared about is  who exactly did haruo fug i have been given conflicting information
  yeah thats animegoji
the heisei era was shit
  its gonna be destroyah
  ur mom shit
  based    fuck heisei fags all they like are the premise of a serious godzilla and gay continuity when both fall flat in execution none of these fuckers realize that stuff like godzilla vs mechagodzilla or godzilla vs destoroyah are bad films yet kids fool themselves into thinking that okawara is a good director theres a reason omori was the only director who had a career after their godzilla movies
  not if you consider their current win ratios against godzilla
  more like he got fugged
  so this is how it ends
  wait did his dead exgf came back or did he fully replace her with moth girls
    you called
    exgf  just in a coma as she wasnt fully assimilated 
  lmao the only serious movies in heisei are 84 and biollante all the rest are mst3k schlock of increasingly poor quality in every sense of the word as the series goes on
  new trailer soon
  it wasnt been a threat since 2004 and thats with kaiser ghidorah
  jobber  most of his losses have been through outside interference and being out numbered  hes protected as fuck ya smarks
    oh no no no    this meme needs to fucking die
  i doubt it the tracker has gone offline a couple times for no discernible reason only thing i can think of is that news of postproduction being finished
  yeah but this time monarch sciences specifically tweeted about it the last time they did was the same day the sdcc trailer dropped so this is likely a hint that a new trailer is coming soon
anyone want some curry i didnt know godzilla had so much of msg
a part in the trailer looks like godzilla is teaming up with the military how strong is ghidorah gonna be in this film
  maybe an international trailer or something like that since its heading towards japan/china
  they already did that though it was basically the same just without a lot of the dialogue
  curry  retard blind or just stupid amerifat
  must have missed it
  so not being able to read moon runes makes you retard blind and american probably you being able makes you smart 50/50 and aryan the fuck did i eat then
  that looks pretty similar to what you get from a block of golden curry to me
    godzilla king of the monsters has a panel at tokyo comic con on saturday december 1 if were getting a new trailer to show before aquaman itll probably debut there
      choose your fighter
  funniest post ive ever seen on /m/ jesus youre fucking stupid
they have to know  
  godzilla march was always my favorite but that may be because godzilla vs gigan is one of my favorites
  monarchsciences twitter just posted that godzilla is heading near japan
    x monarch alert godzilla offline last known coordinates lat26101 lon169430        x monarch alert godzilla online specimen in the sea of okhotsk        x monarch alert godzilla en route to missing landmasss last known location monarch is deploying tactical response teams to further investigate this geological phenomenon
  whens the last time you actually thought about the quality of writing the average godzilla film has same thing with the characters  vs biollante  gmk    so monster fights make or break these movies  not necessarily  what do you think of return of godzilla and godzilla 2014  they both have a good intense sense of mood  scale return has some of the best military stuff of the franchise a fantastic city set  and the final battle of 2014 is great
  none of these fuckers realize that stuff like godzilla vs mechagodzilla or godzilla vs destoroyah are bad films  no they fucking are not  be fucking reasonable and say 90s mothra or vs space godzilla and we can discuss but vsmg2 is fucking fantastic    and nothing about the seriousness of 84/biollante/destroyer falls flat
  nd mothra soloed him multiple times throughout the 90s  after mothra got notable power upgrades and getting completely curb stomped first
tfw grand king ghidorah will never appear again
  godzilla vs mechagodzilla is awful wooden acting bland directing bad pacing and uninteresting effects scenes make it one of the most mindnumbing godzilla flicks    and destoroyah is garbage hard to take it seriously when all connections to the original are never brought to fruition and we have cheesy sequences that rip off aliens
does anyone else remember a scene in godzilla vs the sea monster where godzilla picks up daio asking for a friend
  he was supposed to be the ghidorah that appeared in the ps4 godzilla game but they changed him last minute
  hard to take it seriously when all connections to the original are never brought to fruition  explain  and we have cheesy sequences that rip off aliens  nothing cheesy about them they were badass
question    back in 2013 i had bought a godzilla dvd three pack of movies against mechagodzilla tokyo sos and final wars since the fye was going out of business and it was on sale this was my first exposure to godzilla and i enjoyed it so i went about looking for more dvds only to find the only available ones only offered the corny english dubs that just left me cringing at every line giving that up i decided to go about checking torrents and fortuitously enough i found a pack that had every godzilla movie subbed though ebirah was corrupted i counted my blessings and kept them all on an external hard drive    sadly that external hard drive died last year and ive never been able to refind the movies again some i just cant find some are in such horrible quality is there a comprehensive way to watch godzilla movies at present
  anyone damaing the krilin so goku has to use his full power level  it doesnt mean much when the literal resurrection momster dies
  there doesnt seem to be ive been looking for/requesting that these encodes be uploaded to mega    godzilla1954remastered1080pblurayx264sadpanda  mothravsgodzilla720phdtvxvidac3cg  thereturnofgodzilla19841080pblurayx264futuristic  godzillavsbiollante19891080pblurayx264sadpanda  godzillavskingghidorah19911080pblurayx264sadpanda  godzillaandmothrathebattleforearth19921080pblurayx264sadpanda  godzillavsmechagodzillaii19931080pblurayx264sadpanda  godzillavsspacegodzilla19941080pblurayx264sadpanda   godzillavsdestroyah19951080pblurayx264sadpanda   godzillavsmegaguirus20001080pblurayx264sadpanda  godzillaagainstmechagodzilla20021080pblurayx264phobos  godzillatokyosos20031080pblurayx264walmart  godzillafinalwars20041080pblurayx264walmart    because from what i can telland i could be wrong these are good/the best quality available for them    i already got the return of godzilla from snahpit but the rest i still need
  the movies i found back in the 2014 torrent were hardsubbed
  hell yeah
  explain  filler that went absolutely nowhere forgotten by the time 1/3 of the movie rolled past   they were badass  they were toys and not the awesome ones that cost an arm and leg but the cheapo mass produced bandai crap  if that doesnt get you to realize how much they cared for this movie nothing will   ifukubes score is the only redeeming factor about that trainwreck and even then  90 of it is rerecorded classics
  they were toys and not the awesome ones that cost an arm and leg but the cheapo mass produced bandai crap  what in the fuck are you talking about the ones that battle the swat teams and attack one of the lead females in the police car was a full size prop bigger then a real human being same as the middle suit in pic related just without the long arms  the small more toyish props are only used for distance shots when they swarm out into the open and the military attacks them
    here is a pic of the small prop and it really doesnt look as bad as your saying plenty of detail the legs moved fine
  sorry here
  yfw theres neither a second head nor a bunch of lolishingojis sprouting off from her tail
  they bring in emiko from the original godzilla to drop some lines about how the oxygen destroyer shouldnt be made again and it goes nowhere destoroyah is shown to disintegrate a fish and it never does anything like it again theres all these heavy handed references to the original films iconography like the ginza theater and yamanes stegosaurus skeleton that do little more than serve as fan service they lift stock footage from the original godzilla and its all meaningless bullshit that tries to earn credibility from another film    nothing cheesy about them they were badass    its fucking awful especially when you compare it to camerons aliens the destoroyahs fighting against the police are so stiff and rubbery you have these lazy effects with sloppy rotoscoped lasers and optically added explosions okawara tried to build tension but its such an obvious rip off and the bad effects take you right out of a dull and lifeless scene the scene where the reporter is stuck in a car and an obvious stiff and rubbery prop is in her face is cringeworthy especially with the lack of a soundtrack playing      they used toys for one of the destoroyahs that gets blown up ie optically fades away as an explosion is lazily slapped on it and the scene where the tanks freeze the destoroyahs
anyone know what these little horn things above rodans beak are supposed to be i quite like them and think they add character to his design
  well you see rodan once got into a serious bar fight with godzilla where godzilla shoved a pair of chopsticks through his face and only the tips remained poking out his doctors told him its best not to pull them out
  
  and didnt give a single shit
  so this is what the twins are doing when nobody is around
why is godzilla so badass in mothra vs godzilla  rises out of the ground after a typhoon  casually walks through an oil refinery and sets the entire thing on fire   strolls through nagoya and obliterates two of their landmarks by accident  only stumbles when fired at with experimental american missiles  doesnt even give a shit when landmines are put underneath him  unflinchingly strides through tank fire and roasts some poor tank crew alive with his heat beam  gets blasted repeatedly with electricity and mesh nets and gets away without a scratch  one shots the adult mothra in a fight  requires two mothra larva to take out through kaiju guerrilla warfare  that fucking badass slow reprise of his theme that plays whenever he rampages  that design
  mechagodzilla
  was my first real godzilla movie when i was kid so disappointed that the next entries in the showa are barely on the same level
  not to mention where they drop napalm strikes onto him enough to set him on fire and he doesnt seem harmed
mothra soon
  new trailer on saturday most likely kotm has a 30min panel at tokyo comic con thats been hyped up with monarch tweeting again and neca solicitations for godzilla coming out soon its all but guaranteed
  oh no no no no no no  where the fuck is this reddit tier shit from
i heard a lot of good things about this movie and was really looking forward to it boy was i misled while im hesitant to call it bad its a surefire mess as far as the plot and characters are concerned the conferences and geopolitics are the best things it has going for it they arent good though i have something of a soft spot for the core cast they have a unique vibe that cant be found elsewhere in the series    return of godzilla is in desperate need of an editor theres far too much dead air most of which ruins what was meant to be spectacle it renders long stretches of godzillas rampage and fight with the superx lifeless on the subject of special effects the quality is very inconsistent nakano sprinkled a lot of shoddy moments in what would otherwise be a solid effort and it has what might be the most anticlimactic conclusion of all godzilla movies
the monarch is going to be in a godzilla movie    like the flying cocoon 21 and everything      nice
  i want to blame our very own /tv/
  from what ive heard the godzilla 1985 reedit fixes a lot of the pacing with godzillas rampage
so does mothra show up at all in planet eater or
  but it also has loads of product placement and makes the soviets out to be the villains though on the other hand theres raymond burrs closing speech godzillas death cry and a better score whats the lesser of two evils
sawano scoring a godzilla filmimagine
  nope
  death   anon do you actually believe he died or are you pretending to be retarded
  clearly just gonna edit the good shit together
ghidoras basically that enemy player in a game that walks out into the open and then gets mad as fuck that he gets focus fired down by your whole team at once    oh wow it took 6 of you to kill me fucking faggots
be ready for fri/sat you fig newtons
  binary
  cant wait
    heres what will be at the tokyo comic con panel for kotm    new footage  new sh monsterarts figures  panel with mike dougherty  venue exclusive poster  new godzilla statue
  unicorn  6th mob
what equipment did the filmmakers of each era work with why do the 90s heisei and millennium films look less cinematic than the output from the 50s80s
is it weird that ghidorah was the first godzilla kaiju that actually scared me as a kid even the 1954 godzilla that was sort of going for a horror angle didnt get me the way ghidorah did as a kid maybe its because godzillas bipedal and has a more or less humanoid structure so it came off as less unnatural than the threeheaded ghidorah or maybe its that haunting showa roar
  i was scared of the giant claw when i was a kid the eyes and how close it got to the camera freaked me out
  while doing 84 and bio they actually cared  from kg onwards it was an annual diarrhea of shit being thrown on screen in opes that some of it sticks in order to squeeze out he maximum amounts of profit with the least amount of effort   the fact that the special effects director became a raging depressed alcoholic who couldnt be bothered to give half a shit about the work he produced  obviously didnt help either
which is the better movie
    at least 4 new shma figures will be announced at the panel    which apparently is friday evening us east
      there is nothing wrong with the soviets being the villains  the product placement is only 1 shot of a dr pepper machine  1 guy drinking a dr pepper    besides the general pacing improvements the missile collision sequence is edited vastly better  more suspenseful  the added american music is great  fits alongside the original score perfectly  some of the lesser effects shots especially of the cybots arms are removed  dubbing is just fine  burr is a nice addition    the 85 cut is much better period
  all 4 monsters are being revealed fully    or 4 new godzillas
  said shma figs are literally branded under the kotm brand  the load is being blown anon
  playing the trailer claire de lune music for the 4 slots when you click on them
im not even excited for the figures themselves because i do not have the interest or money to get them im just exited to see their designs get revealed
  i think godzilla vs mechagodzilla ii 1993 is a fun moive
  god just lemme see mothra and a fully colored rodan i need this in my life
  lune  
  im just exited to see their designs get revealed    im amazed they are going to blow their load this early instead of trying to keep everything hush hush till the movie comes out
  even they realize thats gay
  specially after how stupid looking he felt/was in king kong vs godzilla
  im sure they know the basics of the designs were leaked a week before the trailer came out back on /co/ i just wanna see how my main girl looks
  i just wanna see how my main girl looks    shes gonna look like a big moth o
  well duh but according to this shitty gif she might be a pointy moth
  dammit tried to download the song but i cant find the file
what are you /m/en anticipating most out of the panel
  the trailer if were getting one if not then the monsterarts
  i just wanna see ghidorah i need to know if they did him justice
  i mean based on the poster and his silhouette they did
  big king ghidorah fan but i bet that shma kotm ghidorah will be 200 plus looking forward to any new rodan figs though
  im probably gonna grab mothra and rodan myself maybe even goji but ghidorah is notorious for having some flimsy necks in the shma line so who knows
   i know the necks always seem to be an issue personally mine ive been fine its more my tails
apparently theyre already filming godzilla vs kong god i hope its decent i mean adam wingard can at least make a movie look good so we have that
posting who will know because its a good song  
  that poster is so pretentious kek
  why
bear mccreary theme  
  when the trailer dropping
shma godzilla 2019
live stream faggots get in here  mothra now  
  straighter legs than the previous one tail seems thicker as well
mothra
  fun fact those are supposed to mimic godzillas eyes
  fuck thats actually really cool makes sense why she would mimic him as well
rodan
  seems like he has more of a phoenix theme this time around
ghidorah
  fucker is huge i love his new look as well
trailer next week
  next week
godzilla fighting ghidorah underwater seems based on the comic con poster
  i dont think ghidorahs jobbed underwater yet has he
  didnt he do that in 91 and in gmk
  his corpse was dropped underwater but i dont think theyve ever even fought underwater
  ill take your word for it i barely paid attention to heisei series and only really dug 2000 for seeing it in a theater otherwise ive really ignored millenium    yeah underwater is more gameras thing than godzillas i thought
  he usually only travels in it ebirah is the main foe hes fought in water biolantte as well
  the wingspan  hes a biggun
  he also fought battra underwater
  is he missing a head in this picture or is it just hidden
  its in the background as a silhouette
  i wanna hug him
  didnt he do that in gmk  yes
  and heres the shma ghidorah
  fuck hes fucking gorgeous
  her wings also have a flame pattern maybe to also emulate godzillas breath
  wish there was a slightly better angle
  she sos tiny i love her
  mothra looks oddly human theres something about her body that makes me think human
  i hope he grabs something with those little hands
  so how long till we get porn of mothra
  i am gonna be 100 honest that is the best ghidorah design ive seen yet
  you wanna fuck the moth
  anon we all wanna fuck the moth
    honestly i can actually see her handling herself well in a fight i love original mothra with all my heart but this one looks like it deserves the queen of the monsters name
                    holy shit
  mothra
  definitely missing the leak said they fight off the coast of mexico before being shot at with teh oxygen destroyer and that in that fight godzilla decapitates one of ghidorahs heads  he quickly gets better while godzilla gets btfo
  both were underwater at some point in invasion of astro monster
post your verdicts     rodan looks great loving it  ghidora looks really great loving it  mothra i dont like it i want more fluff  godzilla meh never liked beefcake godzilla but looks ok
  i like them all mothra will take some getting used too but i think shell look better in motion
  rodans the best hes ever looked   ghidorah looks amazing  mothra while pretty different is actually pretty cool she looks less like a pushover and more like a queen of the monsters  godzilla is great the tweaks and changes they made are perfect
is jeff waynes tripods the best design
ulla
i dont know why but when i was little the musical terrified me    i think its because i might have taken people with english accents more seriously for some reason
tune    
that  fucking  heat  ray    invisible beam of energy that ignites everything in its path  a line of grass suddenly ignites taking a large group of people with it metres away from where you are standing  a building is suddenly sliced in half as if an invisible giant sword was swung at it then it bursts into flames
    haha ditto    my dad had the original record and i used to go into the attic in the evening and play on the old record player whilst following the bookletscared the shit out of myself each time    for reason the last artwork with crows eating the fighting machines insides used to freaked the fuck out of me too
    tooot
    i cant lie i really wish one day i can see a live show as the dvd was amazeballs
is the 1980s tv series based on the 1953 movie worth watching
    this makes spielbergs design look messy
  yeah if you like those kind of slightly cheesy syndicated scifi shows its definitely one of them
  addendum it has no tripods or flying saucers
        aww you wouldve thought that being made in the 1980s they wouldve had the tech for the tripods
    the whole magnetic legs shit was such a lame fucking excuse
    it has no tripods or flying saucers  disgraceful more /m/ recommendation for you lads the tripods bbc series based on a series of ya novels semiapocalyptic adventure where earths been conquered by alien masters and reverted back to an agricultural society society policed by tripod walkers a group of kids run off before they can have their brainsuppressants installed to join the resistance force in the alps  proper cosy mid80s bbc sf crapquality video surprisingly good but still a bit ropey effects and all and the tripods and masters when they finally show up are just fucking cool
  the tripods bbc        holy shit why havent i heard about this before
  it was
    the fuck
  those things used to terrify me when i was young  i love the fact they needed a separate atmosphere and the humans just called them the masters rather than some silly madeup name
    sucks there wasnt a 3rd season cant believe theres modern mention of this series anywherenor any reruns
  i love it when you think about what the tripods look like theyre a really natural inference on what the creators would look like in the same way humans anthropomorphism our tools they xenopomorphised theirs their city was neat too
        ive never seen the bbc tripod show but they appear to have a done a good job in reproducing how weird and alien the masters and their city were in the books
i need more cursed images from /m/ scrapped backlog to canonical  show me the worst of /m/
  nope
i have this
  god that scene was delicious
  blocks your path
  you want trojan or ddos laced images
  please dont do that here

  fun thing is that this image has some actual strong charge of energy embedded in it
  poor jeg getting punted by a midget
  it is whoever came up with this idea has iiv tortured for days so he willingly draw the concept art  of course its not real but i can only imagine
1080p bd rip when
  im hoping more that we get scans of that art book eventually
  im guessing its the version where they went back and re did the animation at parts and made things worse
whats the novel version of the ships like
is this really the most powerful mobile suit in uc
  why did they make it fat and overloaded
  laughingfukuipng
  its ripped
  is this a v3  what
  realismfags seething
  ugh it has fat calves and looks like it would have to keep the arms out at an angle to keep it from chafing the waist armor    worst of all they fucked with the v shape that was formed by the upper torso and backpack struts it no longer has clean lines its a mishmash of shapes and shit the triple v fin and the little dinky white hat thing for the front of the chest are superfluous as fuck how the hell does the core fighter and transformation work
  v3 is just v2 with a spoonful of clusterfuck    no wonder this shit never get any spotlight zanspine is miles better

1     2     what are your impressions of what you saw people
  turns out that nunnally and suzaku are competent and lelouch has to come out of retirement to save the day  its fine
i can hear the aesthetics screaming saint seiya
    why is aigis hanging out with the code geass cast
what do you think about this movie /m/ like or hate it    i personally still like it even thou its feel so different from the tv series
tell me about akito why does he wear panties on his face
i dug that they went dark i wish they continued it those white nergal aestivalis at the end were sexy as hell
  i watched it for the first time recently it was fun but shouldve been waaay longer than it was the whole thing felt like it was rushed out the door because it was   same problem the tv series has really
  criminally underdeveloped but it was alright
  i watched it a lot later than the movie so my impressions might not be reliable but while the presentation somewhat differed from that of the series which is to be expected of a movie it was similar tonally  i like it about as much as i like the series and i actually think i might have enjoyed it more the hatred is really baseless
actually finished watching the other night i certainly didnt hate it but it certainly has some problems it felt like there should have been a film before it which i guess is the sega saturn game and 2 or so more films after it its main issue is that it short and needs another 15 20 minutes to help flesh stuff out the animation and presentation was fantastic though i just wish there was more to it and more of it
the problem is that its a continuation of a vn on sega saturn no one ever played  it would be great if akito was still the akito from the show rather than muh tastebuds
  hate it too edgy
a game im playing has this as a background graphic and it seems to use real kits the destiny is obvious and i think im seeing strike rouge iwsp can you guys identify any others    also the big yellow one at the too clearly says wdm01  gundam but i dont recognise the art can anyone shed light on that
  anyone
  anyone
    the picture is incredibly blurry i can hardly make out anything
why the fuck does it matter and why the fuck couldnt they find a megami device shelf    that big box is based on the hgcc turn a box art with the actual robot itself replaced although i cant fathom why
theres a justice gundam mg  under the destiny looks like a seed mg kit
the masterpieces of scifi anime
excellent bait my dude hahahahahahahahaha xddddd
best hard science speculative fiction anime  
  cca looked really nice but im not sure the writings really worthy of being called a masterpiece
  i like almost everything in cca besides fucking quess and the hyperfast pacing
    any film starring quess and hathaway cant be called a masterpiece
    there is nothing wrong with quess
  but the pacing was slow if anything
no akira
  quess is like half the movie tho  so then only half the movie is good
            stick to greco brainlet
  ill definitely stick to something thats actually good
  lolsorandom trash made by video game artists is good  lol no  tomino is shit after f91
  lolsorandom trash made by video game artists is good  still better than the adhd nonsense that was cca
  get mental help
  wasnt this exact thread on /a/ a couple of days ago
  greco was good
  hyperfast pacing  it doesnt feel particularly fast to me it just forces the audience to piece together the context because cca doesnt follow zz that closely     i dont mind quess either shes mildly annoying but thematically significant same for hathaway
  i bet you watch hiyazaki movies you entry pleb
  gunbuster is offensively terrible
  your taste is offensively terrible

what was lost will be found    episode and music ddls      new episodes air on saturdays at 700 am jst episode replays are uploaded to youtube the following friday at 3 pm jst    tomica rescue drive head discussion is welcomed as there isnt enough for its own thread    is this the show with the wacky miku and evangelion crossovers  yes    upcoming toy releases  moderoid shinkalion e5 hayabusa  january 31st  moderoid shinkalion e6 komachi  february 28th  moderoid shinkalion e7 kagayaki  march 31st    dxs  shinkalion e3 iron wing  early next year probably    last thread  
miku plushes for you to have some fun with
kinda wish gsc did a promo with alternate parts for the moderoids like they do for some nendos i really like the h5s color scheme but it sure as fuck aint worth its own release
  op you do know hes dxs12 well that would truly complete the rereleases of all the classic shinkalion after all so  also do you think the e5 x doctor yellow will use all the weapons of the other shinkalion for a change like the chou shin kaisatsu sword a fullon combo of the e5 cho kaisatsu sword with the 700 nozomis shinka blade on the back triple fumikiri gun rail stars kankan gun combined with the two fumikiri guns dai sharin drill sharin drill attached on top of the mizuhos dorin hammer twin fumikiri shuriken eightbladed fumikiri shuriken combined from the 2 e3 weapons and the contraption of the h5 sword 800s pantograph arrow and dragon knuckle used against the black shinkalion a while back i mean all he can do is karate because of all the bulk
  its still within the price range of an hg from bandai so its not too bad
  i guess  at least it isnt bandai or h5 would be fucking pbandai for sure
  ill go out on a limb and assume theres some bit about him seeing where this is going but what are the reax to their lewds
      yeah well see an h5 more than likely seeing as miku gets loads of merch and the kits have already had loads of preorders
  why would someone give such a lewd book to them
    fujos know no bounds anon just think of what ryujiblob has probably been though
  want
now kiss
    akita  guh damned perverts the absolute worst people absolutely disgusting there really are people called shotacons huh    hayato  uhh wed never do something lewd like this mister i think you have some kind of sickness i feel bad for you    tsuranuki  takashi my dude is this how you think of us its totally sad    author  no guys youve got it all wrong this is uh its uh
    thanks
    sankyuu shogunkun

  thats a bit of a letdown honestly
gaaaaaay

tfw  these two have kids   earlier than this couple 
oh so genbu does have a mouth also is he made out of stone

  gotta admit this eva reference caught me off guard
episode 46 invasion the black shinkalion of anger    the agent sogyokus plot progresses in the underground world as a battle with the black shinkalion seems imminent ryuuji searches for a way where he can draw out rei gin jo and takatoras best abilities hokuto agrees to help and brings in a very unlikely person to mentor ryuuji who could this person be        most of the episode focuses on taking ninja lad home we see ninja mama in flashbacks i think torame and sogyoku are trying to destroy black shinkalion and seiryu thinks hayato killed genbu willingly
  thats fucked up
  my theory is that all of them are to a degree that as they age they become more and more stone when they die they are completely petrified
  whats really fucked up is the oral sex porn that fujos draw
this is is the face of a man when he see his wife happy
  what is suzaku doing with all this stuff going down    she needs to scheme harder otherwise kairen and friends will kill her
    ed 4 in january
pottery
  so that really means season 2 confirmed
  why though the current ed is the best one weve had so far
not outsourcing your superweapon targeting to google
  well that is to be expected some people kinda bashed it yet this gives me a bit more hope for azusa for some reason n700a e4 max
    or easti theyve already got an e3 mold so why not
  she is from omiya though what lines were e4 max was again
    they do run through omiya i believe
  somethings up with this shinkalion
    were in the top 50
nothing like being snuggled up with friends
  its ok bruh were all in this together  prepares anus
  fuck yeah see people want fun lighthearted colorful mecha stuff  not everything has to be sadness and despair
  whats the matter bro dont want cute girls getting raped to death burned alive and bisected just some gay trains
  already falling behind  now even more delay  i appreciate all weeb does but man this sucks
izumi my dude whats wrong with your fucking hand and wrist  it looks smaller than even the kids hands
guys i dont want genbu to die he is a good lad
  its a kids show  they are just sleeping  _
  unironically they are theyre rock people and they look petrified not dead
  already falling behind  thats because the official yt channel is a week behind
  shashot without the hat is deeply unsettling

drive head movies dvd release which comes out january 16th will include the shinkalion crossover scene it was cut from the version that has been streaming on youtube in chunks
well the rider scans from decembers tvkun have leaked so we shall soon witness the return of the forgotten robo
episode 47 compatible e5 x doctor yellow    the kitoralsus executive sogyoku deploys salamanders in various locations as a strategy to disperse the shinkalion forces seiryu who is fervent about avenging genbu is waiting for hayatos e5 hayabusa in the black shinkalion hayato will use the new power ryuji suggested to settle things with the black shinkalion  a cross gattai with doctor yellow however the conditions to make this cross gattai succeed are difficult        decent episode this week more ryuji than hayato surprisingly were heading into black shinkalion arc 3 i guess    also ninja lad decided to stay at the end of last weeks episode    next time  a god descends upon the capture field
  also ninja lad decided to stay at the end of last weeks episode  wow what a twist spoilers to omoware
  im sickened but curious      wwoah      shes really moe but please do not
oh and we got to see ryujis sister a little more grown up
  also ninja lad decided to stay at the end of last weeks episode  good i would have miss shinobu greatly
  conditions are difficult if ryuji will end up suffering backlash from using e5 x doctor yellow then what will be an alternative
    they made a point of his compatibility level with doctor yellow rising when he deployed he had like a yellow aura
  case in point well theyre seriously bringing back the iron wing just so that they can give us a showcase of e5 x doctor yellow using all shinkalion combined weapons if they want to they can make this show go for at least 2 more months before closing the curtains on it
what is happening here
  hayato has become a train themed vampire and is in the process of converting his friends akita has already fallen and will rise as one of his servants once night falls
  yeah i was thinking vampires or hickies     does japan even do hickies
  ye there was a joke about it in watamote i think
  okay    im sticking with vampires  that kids clearly laying there dead
  wow no one saw that coming  also shinobu looks cute in that honeydewgreen too
    and according to this theres another new robo in the next issue place your bets
1 member of boysandmen gets to appear in episode 48 which is titled december the ultra evolution labs big yearend party theyve released a video of the boys auditions        better be kaito
  ill fucking love it if bananarama gets into shinkalion
  well hes kaito after all plus he is the one with e5 colors in the openings music video  hey at least it should be a big break after we last saw him in the recent episodes of kamen rider zio
5chan talking about a black shinkalion power up for february thats supposedly in the catalog
birthday boy
  woah piloted by jaden smitth
    kaisatsu toblerone
    were still not zoids wild fans
    hasbro had zoids at some licensing expo so theres a chance itll get a dub albeit localized
  someone will pick it up again rright
black shinkalion kurenai crimson
  one day well get to check it out  _
this is all your fault fuckers yeah translate that shitty ntr doujin you broke him he was a happy man subbing trains and he was so saddened by it he had to take a break
    
  i still blame the stupid ntr doujin
  oh boy now they make the black shinkalion even less black not that its really even black in the first place just its aura must be the black shinkalion after joining the heroes side or a completely separate black shinkalion owned by another agent
    someone on 5ch was saying it might have something to do with suzaku but the catalog clearly says power up
  why are sakura and futaba so cute
mobage collab starts on the 6th
    i dont think leons been sent a shinkalion early in a while
  i also heard that e3 iron wing will be released late december  see leon channel is reviewing shinkalion because he is sponsored by televikun dont complain
    yeah obviously but i think he hasnt gotten them like a month early like this for a while
which shinobu do you prefer
  at least its a simple color edit done by the artists themselves the green and silver still match up well because hes shinobu  sorry that im a normie its because people here in this board like fujoshi more
mikus back this week
  noice
i ship it
its time niggas
            its funny how a lot of people ship mikuji even though theyve barely had any intereaction
wait isnt 46 last week episode
  youtube uploads are 1 week late
    第50話予告人知れず第二次性徴期に入りどんどん雄オスの体つきになっていくツラヌキ支給されているパイロットスーツはサイズが合わなくなっていくはっきりと浮き出始めた体のラインは周囲の人々に淫心を生じさせついに
  its funny how a lot of people ship mikuji even though theyve barely had any intereaction  it was because the save during the black shinkalion fight  people saw dem sparks after that it was most likely because she attacked him and both are martial artists tho lol
  thats a nice body all that hard work is paying out
episode 48 december the ultra evolution institutes big yearend party    futaba was appointed secretary of shopping and planning for the ultra evolution lab omiya branch big yearend party honjo akagi knows it will be difficult to manage a unique year end party for the research lab alone however the staff was prohibited from giving futaba advice akagi is at a loss so he depends on azusa and hayato to help futaba will the year end party be a success and will akagis feelings for futaba reach her        e5 x doctor yellow is truely a god hayato had a hearttoheart conversation with seiryu and seiryu admits his favorite thing is the shinkalions seems hes starting to change sides next week
  apparently everyone made it in
    theyre still saying only one of them will get a voice role
  yay more migu more h5 more fun
  omega flowey as the boss of the week
  akagi is at a loss so he depends on azusa and hayato to help futaba will the year end party be a success and will akagis feelings for futaba reach her  i see what they are doing i see it they think slick but they not
    it better work out for honjo he gets abused daily and already has nightmares about getting cucked
  meanwhile this nerdy guy was an absolute chad
  is romantic progress rare in kids shows
  is more about they using the other possible future romanticthey are like 12 couplehayato and azusa to send messages between the probably romantic couplehongo and futaba
kaito lost 
when you look into his eyes
  if you look close enough his eyes are blinking morse code for torture
  do you read sutter traine
seiryuu got rekt like a random motw
  futaba joins boys and men band with the boys      hojo depressed because futaba might have a dick    i can see where this story is headed
  nice
cute
  gives me the same feels as 
  i always knew azusa would be a knockoff kizuna the same way hm would be a knockoff of the real miku

more fe/m/  preferably no monoeyes
    
  thank you kind sir
movie about a guy who is resurrected by fucking tank spirits to fight a mysterious white tiger tank  is this /m/
no
tanks are mechanical mechanical is mecha mecha is /m/
whats with the hitler being alive at the end of this movie 
  a guy who is resurrected by fucking tank spirits to fight a mysterious white tiger tank
fury meets ghost in the shell sounds kinda shit but ill give it a watch
  it is pretty shit if you want decent russian wwii tank scenes just watch the liberation series unless youre put off by stalin wanking
how would he do against the haunted tank
  have russians ever made decent ww2 movie come and see was good and only old men are going was more about drama than the fight
  as ussr fell shakhnazarov lost his directing skill   original novel is better though it has an antisoviet bias    directors attempt at being philosophical    brest fortress  coproduction with belarus   people say that zvezda and moment of truth are decent  thats if we speak about postsoviet cinema
  still the single greatest piece of tank fiction
  i dont think anyone there will ever make a movie that makes russians less than the righteous victors of war not because they dont want to but that would not sell given the animosity anyone in east europe who is not a serb to a lesser extent belarus have toward russia to the point some blatantly engage in nazi imagery and glorify nazi collaborators ironic given that nazis would have exterminated their kind to make their living space i highly doubt we are ever going to get good ww2 movie from that side these days  well as you pointed out they made come and see
sieg zeon
not so fast this is uef territory cybran
does anyone here own a zeon flag or something with the zeon flag on it and gotten shit for it because of its similarity to the nazi war flag
  i have a delaz fleet flag  anybody whos asked has been satisfied with theyre bad guy space nazis from a cartoon but anybody who comes by my place is some degree of nerd so theyre familiar with the concept of bad guy space nazis of one stripe or another
  my xbox gamerpic was the zeon flag til some mexicunt reported it and i was forced to change it
  damn southern americans are too cocky after that colony missed jaburo now they think theyre blessed by newtype jesus
  too bad gundam didnt take off there like mazinger or saint seiya youd have hijo de zabi and at least two char_s working the indies  
    ya think    anyway has anyone yet figured out what the mon means heard some say its a rose of all things

    is it bad i thought the sinanju looked meh at first and the zulus bad but now i love the zulus and think sinanju looks shit
  keep crying bitches
  january 3rd 0079 best day of my life brothers
  i did have a run in with a fox news reporter  i gave him a quick overview of the series and told him to watch war in the pocket
  i used to have a zeon emblem on the gas tank panel of my old car had more people asking me if it was some satanic symbol instead of a nazi symbol so theres that
  nah i had a similar experience with the dom and zgoks
  if youre wearing neo zeon shit in public you are so socially clueless that you deserve to get punched
  but i dress up like quattro everytime i go outside
i think side 3 sucks
  i have my room littered with zeon paraphernalia literally never has anyone whove been in it asked if it was nazi stuff
  well when no one but you is ever actually in your room
  b a s e d  a  s  e  d
  you are my enemy
    was it tucker carlson     also some of you guys are alright dont go to iffish tomorrow
  yesterday i wear tan shirt with zeon patch sewn on the chest an uber driver asked me what flag is that i only say its from cartoon
why are zeon aquatic mobile suits so high tier
this is /m/s official zeon thread  destroy any phony threads
 being zeon   shit get bitchslapped by ef   being neo zeon   shit get bitchslapped by ef again   being neo neo zeon   shit get bitchslapped harder by ef again    git gud zeeks
  earth is 70 water so zeon came prepared after that 1 briefing meeting when every was shown how much water is on earth and lost their minds
  i thought neo zeon got beat before the ef mobilized
  gets me every time
  t londo bell
  it did same thing with neo neo zeon getting destroyed by only 20 mobile suits zeon cant into war
is youtube the only place i can watch the nutrocker short film         
  pretty much ive been searching for a higher quality version but im pretty sure there is none were it not for the youtube upload this could have ended up as lost media
  i came across a torrent listing on deadfrog from way back in 2006 which is probably where the youtube upload  google site came from but thats all gone now there really needs to be a better archival effort wrt to yokoyamas work
  just ordered a probably shitty chinese recast of this anybody got any good ideas for a paint scheme
  maschinen krieger has always fascinated me every design is so raw clunky brutal its the most unique mecha design ive ever seen    it also seems completely unapproachable all i can do is admire the designs the kits are far too high in skill level for me to ever attempt one and all the cool backstory is in japanese and ill never be able to read it
  this wish there was something like an ova or two set in the setting  i wonder whether the hollywood which was announced a while ago is ever going to be made
  i have both the original and the recast and there is almost no difference heres my second build
    the paint scheme is mr color grey green base german grey joints hull red for the chest and plates and a sepia acrylic wash over the whole thing to give it a desert sand tone
  the kits arnt that hard especially the 1/20 wave kits if you can do some basic seam welding youll be fine and if you want to learn how to paint in the style look up lincoln wright on youtube
    that looks excellent anon glad to hear the recast is good in that case i might even snag a second    right now im thinking about a starship troopersinspired paint scheme
ive never really understood why the name of the story franchise property world line was changed from sf3d to maschinen krieger
  absurd copyright battles
  where the hell is that gif from
  as is the case for most properties of its time

heres mine for a magical girl anime about mothra    regular japanese school girl in middle school lives in far future where monster attacks and alien invasions are things of the past after the last siting and attack by godzilla was almost 100 years ago and technology is more advanced for dealing with such threats  on her way home girl falls into cave in forest and is pulled inside cocoon after touching it and starts having visions of mothra as the twins are singing the mothra theme  wakes up hospital and is soon taken home by parents  she decides to take a bath  she starts freaking out when her body starts turning into a moth  similar to pic related but a little more extreme with elements of body horror like the fly  batras spirit shows up as smaller moth as big as a real moth and explains she is now the new protector and priestess of the last mothra egg and most also defend the earth from aliens and shit  then starts telling her that shes stuck as a moth monster and will have to leave her loved ones forever and live a life of solitude and theres no going back   girl breaks down and cries about how she will miss her family and normal life and scene becomes super emotional  tiny mothra shows up and scolds batra for trolling the poor kid with leaving her family but batra complains about mothra running his fun  mothra apologizes to the kid about batra and tells her how she doest need to leave her family since she has the power to change back into a human  mothra then tells her how the mothra priestess twins died and the new mothra needs a protector and tells her about her powers  which includes powers similar to mothras including the ability to talk to other monsters for when she needs to visit monster island  then she comforts the girl with a hug or something cute like that

    if this were the 90s wed definitely be getting a monsterverse animated series after godzilla vs kong  unfortunately seeing as modern cartoons are calarts dominated filth it would never happen and if it did it probably wouldnt be worth watching  i have my own dumb ideas for it but dont really have time to post them might if the thread is still around later
its super dumb now really dumb not trolling or anything but its gotten really bad its always been pretty dumb but now its full on idiot mode     used to watch it avidly until after ooos and goseigers when real life got in the way and i recently went what the fuck why not and watch some of the newer stuff and i couldnt watched an episode of ghost abd i wanted to die watched an episode of jyuouger and i wanted to die     i used to make fun of guys on hju saying stuff about 00s sentai is shit and heisei rider isnt real kamen rider but now the shoes on the other foot and i feel like an old grumpy man any suggestions any goid shows between ooos and now that are pretty solid im going back in completely dry here guys
  start by naming the things you dont like in the current tokus and that are different than the older ones
  yeah i understand that feeling kamen rider hasnt been the same since fourze the new show is one of the worst things that i saw in my life and i finished decade
gaims pretty good
  well i liked how the older shows allowed the toys to me naturally introduced into the show how the action set pieces were pretty good and how it felt atmospheric and had a good narrative even if they fucked up the landing     ghost just felt empty of any of the earlier riders charm and jyuouger felt like it was made for a preschool audience i dont like it when the toys just clusterfuck instesd of being naturally included and i certainly didnt like the lack of action nor the weird designs of the kaijin aesthetics ate hella important in toku to me
  gaim then you wont regret it
  gobusters they didnt have many toys until half way in
  jyuouger  fuck off you tvn watching faggot
  watch gaim or build    or jinga
  avoid build ghost and wizard man exaid would probably piss you right off as well but less than the other three
  fourze is probably closest to the ooo coming right off of it but right after that you have wizard and thats the combo breaker in a series of good things     gaim is fun but turns into random butcher cliche at the end because he cant write an endgame drive is pretty great because it tries three week plotlines instead of two ghost was middle of the road so hard it looped back to being offense exaid is meme assault with some decent plot scattered in and build tried to be deep but it just came off as pretentious and the last arc crashed and burned harder than any in recent memory     zio is a celebration of this clusteruck of an era so theres that
  gaims endgame was so dumb it was endearing though especially watching the grapist go insane
  seeing a of rider heredo amazonz season 1 seems up your alley but on sentai side id also avoid kyuranger it tried to do too much and had a shoestring budget lucky is also the worst red in ages
  do amazonz sounds like everything you want from this complete with fucking up the landing in season 2
take  a  walk  on  the  showa  side
  ghost  theres your problem
you tried to get back into toku with ghost yeesh shouldve asked for recommendations first ghost set a new standard for the worst kamen rider could get truly abysmal
  any suggestion  first you stop using tvnihon for subs      but now the shoes on the other foot and i feel like an old grumpy man  im gonna take a wild guess and assume you got into toku around 20072009 and more familiar with early heisei   i have similar experience and phase 2/postgokaiger sentai almost burned me on tokusatsu in general  avoid recent sentai if you feel that way if you cant tolerate childish shows that ship has sailed you can try watching gokaiger people tend to like it  as for kamen riders try gaim or build they are relatively good exaid is good as well but its really gimmicky and a lot of early suits looks like shit drive can be enjoyable if you can tolerate annoying supporting cast and unfunny jokes  try catching up with garo or watch amazons    if nothing above really makes you interested in watching toku again just accept that youve grown out of it and move on to things that you actually like
  youaregettingolder    the toku shows of today are aimed purely for 610 year olds there is less blood less seriousness and more stupidity if you want your broody angry but well written toku show it needs to air late night or be a web exclusive like amazon welcome to the new japan were its as bad as america with censorship
disregard new shows watch metal heroes
  watched an episode of ghost  why did you watch an episode of that of all things the only way you could have got worse impression is if watched wizard
  wizard isnt bad as an impression if you only watched one episode    the problem starts when you watched the series and realized that between the first arc and last arc its just repetitive shit
  can relate anon watch build that was the kamen rider that brings me back to watch kamen rider again and then watch exaid   exaid is the perfect example of how is the new era of kamen riders because it is for ids but it has his moments
        yeah ill probably check it out heard good stuff about it and i know urobushi wrote it who i unironically do like     i used to be a big fan of kobayashi only series of her shes written i didnt love was shinkenger and it was still pretty damn good but ive heard shes gotten hella worse now is it true       already done that skyrider and black are kino           i liked the base form a lot so i gave that a try and jyuouger i heard was pretty decent so i gave that a shot as well       i dont believe that if it was i wouldnt be able to enjoy any tokusatsu and my main show was always ultraman is it just toei that shit the bed
  ghost is dogshit  i think youd like gobusters for sentai and either build or gaim for rider
  i used to be a big fan of kobayashi only series of her shes written i didnt love was shinkenger and it was still pretty damn good but ive heard shes gotten hella worse now is it true  i dont know where you got that impression toqger is probably my favorite sentai even if its kiddy as fuck you kinda just have to accept that going into sentai really along with stuff like shinkenger ooo etc    she hasnt worked on a mainline rider in a while but she did amazons which is pretty good first season is great second less so but i still enjoyed it overall
  is it just toei that shit the bed    its more that bandai has gotten even worse about enforcing their bullshit even if its to the detriment of the series
  yeah watching ghost wasnt the best idea like others have gaim build and exaid are ones to check out with rider they are still toy heavy but not unnaturally so for the most part while still having entertaining stories and characters
  yeah i gave up on the newer series of ultraman kr and ss theyre too toyetic now with no sense of anything beyond that kr has been bad for a long time though decade being the most notable point of going downhill
  tokus always been dumb fun you filipino faggot
  theyre childrens shows so its not really surprising that you can grow out of them
  lower ratings  more power to bandai
  first season is great  first season of amazons is mediocre and it only picks up near the end  for kobayashi standards amazons are fucking embarassing but then again so is her every other rider show except maybe ryuki which still had a lot of shit she really should just stick to sentai
  gaim is garbage at times    build is the worst rider series ever made are you high
there are morons in this topic shittalking wizard and ghost while giving dribble like exaid and build a pass    what is wrong with you guys also op go with ultraman geed kamen rider drive and gobusters
  wizard is underrated but i cant blame people for hating it show got some real issues  i cant imagine why would anyone defend shitstorm that is ghost no matter how bad other seasons can get there is always ghost to back them up from behind  and assuming youre not shitposting can you actually say why do you think exaid and build are bador why would you want to recommend inconsistent messes like gobusters and drive instead
  watch build    it is the best kamen rider show bar none its just a complete package shitposters will say it isnt but i have been watching kamen rider for over 20 years now and i can assure you it is    build does everything all other rider series did but does it even better for example early heisei rider series had amazing designs and a more mature feel but most of them lacked in writing pacing and fights    neoheisei series have gottan a lot better in those areas for the most part you still had awful shows like ghost  shows like gaim and exaid have plot progression escalation of stakes well defined story arcs with amazing fightsbut they forgot what made early heisei awesome in the proccess which was the cool designs for the most part    build takes these things and merges them together so you have a main rider with an amazing suit a great story that has nice progression and pacing each episode building onto the one prior well defined story arcs with stakes being raised like no other series ever did incredible fights some of them span an entire episode not even kidding you even have a tournament arc in the middle with 3 backtoback fights that spans a total of three episodes of pure fighting its amazing it even has references to showa series in some of the story bits    build is just too fucking good im afraid on other rider series will ever be this good
  the odd part is ive only really seen shitposters say build is the best series     i mean i can give it cool designs but like everything the show had going for it the designsgenius black hole etc the pacing the characterizationwhat was mad rogues relevance to the plot ending and even the ending fell so amazingly short it leaves the series as good at best       i honestly cant take anybody serious that says build has good progression and pacing because every single episode tries to feel like a gigantic final episode but falls short because the plotlines dont organicly flow into each other first arc/hazard arc/and everything after evolt feels like dramatically different series it starts off as a rider trying to find out his past and fight the evil organization that made him but this barely lasts the cour and suddenly its a warwhcih we were blueballed by the way and then suddenly every problem in setting is the fault of a single alien nevermind you have sento with the charisma of a stick with banjo was a fantastic example of a heisei rider pulling off the reluctant justiceman     then you have the fights and dont get me wrong build had some great fightsmagma vs evolt phase 1 comes to mind but a lot of them early on and yes even in the tournament you mentioned amounted to cycling cg finishers because builds suit actor is just getting old     it was a fun series but i cant really call it the best at everything it just feels like a series of checkboxes that needed to be checked
  a great story that has nice progression and pacing each episode building onto the one prior well defined story arcs with stakes being raised like no other series ever did  build has a lot of shit writing which sticks out like a sore thumb story also ends up being all over the place   i uniroinically think build is great for kamen rider series but its far from being perfect   its gaim 20 and it inherits a lot of problems from that show      it was a fun series but i cant really call it the best at everything  the sad thing about build being one of the best shows which it is is that it says more about overal qualiy of the franchise rather than quality of the show itself
  the sad thing about build being one of the best shows which it is    id say its a mid tier kinda dealie its not amazing at the top of the scale but its not the worst at the bottom of the scale    with some proper thought and pacing it really could have been something but it just kinda fell into the same drops the ball final arc limbo all riders do
shut up stupid w fag your show is overrated
  super sentais ratings have been falling over the years without much regard to the actual quality of the show
  never forget that time bandai/popy pulled their backing from minky momo despite the tv show doing well and the toys not so much
  epic contrarian meme  ghost and wizard were your favorites too right
didnt /m/ hate gaim because of urobuchi  or was it /krg/ thing
  i didnt care for ghost that much but i did find it enjoyable
  avoid build    it is the worst kamen rider show bar none its just a complete package shitposters will say it isnt but i have been watching kamen rider for over many years now and i can assure you it is    build does everything all other rider series did but does it even worse for example early heisei rider series had amazing designs and a more mature feel but most of them lacked in writing pacing and fights    neoheisei series have gottan a lot better in those areas for the most part you still had cool shows like ghost  shows like gaim and exaid have pointless talking going nowhere lacks monsters of the week with soso fights but they forgot what made early heisei likeable in the process which was the cool designs for the most part    build takes these things and merges the worst together so you have a main rider with an bleh suit a horrific story that has random progression and pacing each episode forgetting onto the one prior constant babble that leads nowherre like no other series ever did boring fights some of them span an entire episode not even kidding you even have a tournament arc in the middle with 3 backtoback fights that spans a total of three episodes of pure fighting that somehow sucks ass it even has references to showa series in some of the story bits for furthers insults    build is just too fucking awful thankfully other rider series will never be this bad
  same  i dont get why ghost gets all the hate when say drive isnt particularly better
  neoheisei  hahahahahahahahahaha youre cute
    which one of you is the another rider
  i liked how the older shows allowed the toys to me naturally introduced into the show  i dont have the webm of kusaka throwing the axel watch at takumis head or tsukasa finding the ktouch just lying on the ground but just know im acknowledging those examples as well when i post pic related
  did the suit actor not know how to extend the spinning kicks past each foot once i get those suits are hard to move in but with a lack of anything on the waist or crotch he shouldve been able to continue enough to cut a proper loop
  obviously its  youd never see anybody on /krg/ call something good
  any goid shows between ooos and now that are pretty solid  fourze and drive and the only two kamen rider shows worth paying attention to from that period and even they are bogged down with some gay stupid stuff too often for thier own good theres this awful bad comedy direction style that rider started using often during ooo and it infects many episodes from all following shows its like the directors grew up watching trick but didnt at all understand what made the direction in that show great so they just go crazy with sound effects and unfunny visual gags nonstop    for super sentai well gokaiger is great and that is about it new toku has just gotten too gay as a whole i dont believe for a second that kids dont like manly shit anymore the studios just wont let them see it
  
  whines like a retard  hurr its so dumb omg  posts w shit  when w has had some of the most retarded episodes of neo heisei  retard
  neoheisei
  so which neoheisei series is your favorite anon i particularly enjoyed build and i think it really represents the neoheisei era the way kuuga represented the heisei era
  it just feels like a series of checkboxes that needed to be checked  its literally just that build is just an amalgamation of plot elements and twists from successful rider series with no real care put into whether or not theyll actually work or not every time something feels off like the twist with banjo emu and parado or the constant cheap attempts at raising the stakes trying to copy the success of past series such as gaim raising the stakes to apocalyptic levels or gentoku suddenly becoming comic relief trying to make dan 20 someone involved with the show was either told to copy a previous show or did it of their own accord
  depends on which toku youre talking about theyre primarily kids shows but even if im older i always go back to them to enjoy them in their ridiculous splendour some of them turns out to be pretty solid even     like i primarily watch ultraman and while mebius definately smacks of kiddie shit at first i thought it grew real fast on me the more episodes i watch it /m/ wasnt kidding when they say its fucking great and it makes going back to the older shows easier
  t kamenriderwikiacom
so given how fucking dangerous and skilled darryl became after his final augments and being jacked into the psycho zaku how insanely deadly would zeon aces have become if they went through the same process   talking aznable ridden and gato as examples
  char is already a newtype  so i guess they would be a level below him after enchancement
could a space godzilla actually work as a film back in the day  it would have had the first female godzilla and we could have gotten a movie without boring humans for once and focus on just the monsters  plus it would be pretty funny to see giant monsters talking to each other and have their own civilization
  but a space godzilla has humans with the researchers and espers who make contact with dead godzillas brain and make her into a rocket ship
  the enemy monster shoots fire out of her nipples spiders out of her mouth and swastika shurikens out of her belly button    yep sounds like it would totally work as a film
godzilla coming from a planet of godzillas leaves a bad taste in my mouth
  absolutely not     could see it as an awesome gamera movie though
 godzilla movie by the guy that made house    it would have been a wild ride thats for certain
        nigga wat is there a summary/script out there
  yeah an illustrated story treatment was published in japanese starlog one of katsuhiro otomos early pro works iirc  somebody translated it a while back    
  it would have had the first female godzilla    cringe
art by katsuhiro otomo    really
what would he have piloted  rest in peace george

  i may not have liked him but he was president   f

  out of context but imagine the first gulf war but with the us military using gm iiis and jegans against iraqi zaku f2s and monkey model gazacs
  wrong bush
  low energy post
not american was this the one that killed jfk or the one that did 9/11
  the older one probably most famous for promising no new taxes during his campaign finding out that he actually needed to raise taxes and being willing to bite the bullet and actually do it even though he knew it would cost him reelection he still wasnt one of my favorites but that took some guts
  the one that killed jfk  he idnt do it the israelis did it because his brother robert was going to force aipac to register as a foreign lobby within 24 hours but withing that very 24 hours jfk was killed and then lbj had no interest in doing that and proceeded to be their puppet in passing disastrous stuff like the 1965 immigration bill    and then robert was killed by them too while he was running for president    elder bush was less of a puppet for them than his son but he was only very slightly marginally better in that regard
    whats the feddie oyw equivalent of a grumman avenger
  read my lips  metal wolf
  how deep are the bogdabots in your mind
  honestly if the left back then was exactly the same as the left right now hed probably be remembered a lot more fondly
bwahaaa war is bad we should just understand each other  autistic kids unironically believe this
    this will be a good thread thank you for the quality post
  posting the guy who lost all his girlfriends in a war against an autistic child
  30some episodes later
if narrative alone brought such an amount of shitposters here i fear what the hollywood movie will do to this board
  no only autistic girls think that the true redpill is knowing that world is just made of decisions of adults pretending they know what they are doing
  he thinks the shitposting problem is new because theyre shitposting about understanding rather than zeta / zz/ turn a / mazinger z / getter robo / ibo / active raid / planet with / valvrave / gun x sword / generation wars bullshit / insert shitposters new topic of the month here
space guts not only finds and pilots barbatos but is also the proper mc of the show what changes
show goes from 4/10 to 7/10
  gundam finally gets an mc with a romantic subplot worth caring about
  barbatos  fuck that give me gusion in parade gundam colors but give it the fuckheug sword
  two fuckheug swords to hold in each of its arms
  show would improve i like mikazuki but akihiro had more stuff going on with him
    absolute madmen i love it though barbatos has the whole fuckeug sword thingie going on and he becomes barbatos lupus later going full mad dog which ties much more with guts thing  plus barbatos has the whole mc plot armour going on
  absolutely nothing would change
  well i guess since his brain bsods when he confronts the mobile armor in season 2 i guess the mobile armor doesnt get stopped
  nah since he would probably lose his right eye at least just like mike august did he would truly ascend to gutsdom and go full black swordsman on the armour    or he could do like the anons befoe said and just go full guts gundam like pic related
  hes not as laser focused crazy and talented as mikazuki so tekkadan gets taken down earlier by choco and gali gali in space
  god think about it  wed have gotten a 1/100 scale gusion full city
  replace a spade with someone who actually becomes the mc  huge improvement
  compromise barbatos gets a huge sword that splits down the middle to turn into scissors so you can still have akahiro crushing particular foul villains to death
  make the scissors capable of splitting into smaller swords and we have a deal
  yeah that works so a pair of swords that can combine either as a larger sword or as a pair of scissors sounds pretty cool
    mika was only able to fight the mobile armor because he had enough av and even with three whiskers wasnt able to safely disengage the limiter spaceguts only has two whiskers and as such wouldnt be able to turn off the limiter like mika did he would be trashed
  or with him in a protagonist role hed have the same plot device that mikazuki did
are any of these worth watching
nah korean and chinese cgi shows tend to dumb it down to the point only kids below 9 with add can watch them they arent familyfriendly like nipponese ones where older teens can watch and fap to r34 later
  this was pretty good from what i remember
the first season of turning mecards not bad
  mattels import against transformers  ill stick with transformers that has atleast decent cg and human necks
  not liking quality character designs
  mini force is kinda fun
  dino core is good annoying lead character but solid action and great mechatbusters is another one it is more comedy based but good and its entire first season has good english subtitles on youtube 
  some people dont look to these shows for their pedophilia masturbatory needs
octonauts is better
  which dub of this is supposed to be the good one again
  furry rangers episodes are 11 minutes long so it shouldnt be too big a waste of time if you end up not liking it the leader saves the day on his own half the time though and the human sidekick can get grating quickly
  korean chinese and us you mean
  familyfriendly  fap fodder      what show is this
  the newer ones better than the old one but still not great
another glorified korean toy commercial monkart    all episodes can found on youtube
  turning mecard r
  dem waifus bruh
  impregnation material
  tobot v the mech designs are awesome as are the toys    wrong
  tobot v
  the toys are neat
  holy shit ive completely forgot that show existed
  it helps that theyve been moving away from light/sound gimmicks to articulation and combination
  articulation  nice but what about the plastic quality
surprised none of these have made it to the states    or at least their toylines  maybe they could make a different cgi show for westerners to go with one of these
  i think mini force was on some usa streaming like netflix
  but its a korean show without much effort put in  what if someone imported the toyline made a different cgi show but put effort into the writing  that could be neat
  i havent watched a ton of it but other than the bad guy whos that bad guy from incredibles it seemed pretty not bad compared to traditional lolcorea like our friend power 5
gas the belters space war now
i watched the first season and thought it was breddy gud are two and three also high quality
  yeah it maintains good quality throughout
  you could at least use the same font
  i have not gotten around to watch season 3
translated version of the 2012 guide/staff interview book is set to be released in january anyone else getting it
teyandee isnt all that solid outside of some exceptionally good designs and setpieces    samurai pizza cats on the otherhand is one of the best shows ever in the history of ever
    its amazing how much of a difference an oddball translation can make
  thats what happens when you dont get the script and have to improvise everything
  translated version of the 2012 guide/staff interview book is set to be released in january anyone else getting it  who is putting it out
  that shit still makes me laugh i bloody love this show
  udon
      the overall sense of humor is actually pretty similar between the two just that the original is more subdued about it while the dub turns it up to 11 but that means that a lot of the humor in the original is also puns and referential stuff thus being hard to translate and often flying over the heads of audiences outside of japan
    i often wonder if japan is aware of this shows beloved status over here in north america and how much its bizarre mst3kstyle humour contributed to that and if they are what they think of it
  from what ive seen theyre somewhat aware that its popular overseas but dont really know much more than that
  turning a kotatsu into a radio playing barry manilow thats glued to the bottom of a card table  you really had to be an adult at the time to really appreciate the random humor        maybe its probably theyre away of it but not enough to make anything out of it like takashis castle was turned into most extreme elimination challenge i think the only time they went full circle is when they subbed mighty morphen power rangers

  huh as it turns out apparently members of the staff have said thats a thing im literally just learning this now    pic related is kind of flavor of the month for me as it were not even really sure why i just kinda like her maybe its that she wasnt written into some kind of relationship with a gundam pilot never betrayed anyone or changed sides was always at least basically competent at worst and didnt die thats a rare combination
does ibo have the most graphic onscreen violence out of any gundam series i know worse stuff is implied in other shows but still
  seed had people basically just exploding from microwaves didnt it
  it couldnt even do the mecha gore right
  best cockpit deaths for sure      yep
  i didnt watch seed so im not sure any screen caps  id say ibo did it more frequently if not to that extent
  ahem
  and yet a bunch of junkers end up rigging that gun up to their ship and using it as its original intention a booster for them to go to mars
  all those command deck babes dead  fucking tragedy
  yeah but those felt so over the top that they didnt have much impact at least for me
  i bet fukuda got off to this
  barbecued ribs
  thats how they get away with it even ibo played it up somewhat really grounded violence would look weird and/or disturbing
      i still wonder how they thought the gorn in seed was a good idea not only is it just plain gross its incredibly out of place when compared to every single other aspect of seeds aesthetics as well as the fact that as much as gundam as a franchise often tries to hide it its still generally meant for kids    like ive seen a lot of anime gore over my almost 30 years of life and theres only been a handful of examples i found more disgusting than seeds
  all of ibos violence was over the top even the ops image
  if you say so
  aka seed was run by morons
  no youre just a faggot
  keep in mind the generation of anime fan that enjoys seed also enjoy trash like elfen lied
  eh at least i understand how elfen lieds violence fits with it seeds is a square peg in a round hole several sizes too small for it
  the little girls name was elletan    even fukuda agrees elle was worse zz girl
  top 10 saddest anime deaths
personally the one death i remember most in the entirety of gundam is that one grunt in gsaviour who mark is talking to right before he goes down in a hail of bullets
  seed has a death shot for every grunt in the last 20ish episodes theres a reason but im not going to spoil it for you in the hopes you learn to think
  the dude that blew up in alaska was way more graphic than that
i remember that one girl screaming out save me ribbons before she got allelujahd that stuck with me for some reason
  the dude that blew up in alaska was way more graphic than that  looks about the same to me people popping and maybe like a frame or two of guts visible    
  came in here to post this and i liked kiras friend having his head torn off onscreen
  jesus fucking christ thats a bit excessive kinda want to watch seed now
  yeah i get it its them being incredibly hamfisted about the whole war is bad messsage that gundam as a franchise has never been particularly good at portraying
  00 didnt have much graphic violence but the people being consumed inside out by the els crystallization was a bit creepy no guts but theres blood and suddenly crystals growing out of your flesh    makes me think of that bone cancer picture where otherwise relatively smooth bone structure deform into a spiky surface that must be hell on the inside of your body
imagine being this unlucky
  that shell casing changes scale three times    great
stargazer doesnt hold back
  how the fuck does the desk explode
  it really does seem like they lucked into making a decent series once and sunrise threw more money at them in the hopes of lightning striking twice
  war is bad  but check out all these cool explosions  and the awesome flying robots  and the cool mceverydude who turned out to be super special and saved the day  and tits oh wait she ded  more explosions    so yeah war is bad unless you happen to be the main character then its pretty fucking sweet buy gunpla
  its incredibly out of place when compared to every single other aspect of seeds aesthetics  i at least agree with this much its perhaps one of the least gritty most flowery gundam series literally written to focus around perfect genetically engineered people and its got deliberately gross gore shit
  where did their bones go their environment would surely vaporize before their bones
  war is good because it defines our individuality
  hes gonna come back as a elsinnovator hybrid right guys
  i remember that one girl screaming out save me ribbons before she got allelujahd  that doesnt count innovaids arent people
  i agree seeds gore felt over the top and out of place whereas say the dead bodies littered around side 7 at the start of 0079 felt like an actual tradegy
  those genetically engineered people are doomed    seed setting was a bit dark but the main cast was extremely positive
  those aids couples got ripped off if they wanted a healthy baby there are already methods for that without that chinese genetic engineering in the news
    ibos worst is still kudal getting bisected through his entire body and then incinerated by the cockpit blast
its seed hands down i guess fukuda has a gore boner because except for dendoh which was explicitly for little kids every other show has people exploding being liquefied stabbed spilling their guts out or being bisected by laser beams and he doesnt just do the whole face close then white out gundam usually does he shows the guy screaming while a huge laser tears half his face off or someone being grinded to bits while they vomit blood all over their helmet    fukuda is the man
  you never played fighting force 2
  even his racing anime
  no but on the other hand this is the only chance i will ever have to post this
autism manlet straight up point blank execution style shoots like two niggas within the span of the first three episodes  nothing of interest happens for one and a half seasons    wasted potential if im allowed to be quite honest with you family
  never boticed it while airing but i did on a rewarch last year sword split his body in half like a log
  what the fuck fukuda
  and how can we forget that nicole was 15 who liked to play piano
  ibo literally had 3 characters survive graze eins attack despite the implied blood spills  seed does not fucks around it had kura yamato survive nuclear explosion
    that foreshadowing of ein and gaelio getting impaled in the cockpit by swords    i never even noticed it before now
    gundam as a whole would have been much more graphic had tomino keep to one of his original ideas for it
  i like to tell myself their deaths got ret conned for sii  fucking bullshit tho they undid any point to the series over and over
  nope still curious
mika scoring a home run with that dudes body using the wrench mace was pretty great
  that was one of the best scenes in ibo
    whats it like being 13
  behold my magic animationsaving powder
  thats a really low bar
  why was i the only one complaining when 00 did literally two entire seasons of that
  that flash of guts and ribs  never ceases to impress me
  00 had some quality moments too
  maybe im misremembering but season 1 was fairly light on them or had things explode into dust after something cool was shown
    what exactly is the powder saving on the animation of they still had to animate barbatos advancing in to the screen and then hitting the guy at most it saved them a few frames of wider shots of barbatos theres worse examples of both animation and animation saving techniques in the show thats quite a tame example really
  ibo literally had 3 characters survive graze eins attack despite the implied blood spills  that was peak spineless writing the shock value of three characters dying without anyone actually dying or any sort of loss or setback for the protags
  having the gundams literally never walk or jump in almost the entire show and replacing hand drawn thruster trails with particle effects is a massive animation shortcut to start with and there is a fuckton of mediocre art obscured by particle effects and blurred after images
  yeah just look at the way this tieren flies    without the effects its very lackluster
    thatd be true if the thruster effects were hand drawn too though as in the unit would look olazy without them a lot of jets that fly in real life look kind of odd because they leave little to no obvious thruster wash given the engine efficiency
  so besides dendoh and seed what else has he done again          this is one of the reasons i like f91 so much it still has violence in it but its violence that actually fits the mood and tone of what it is being included in
  that was actually sad
  aftercredits scene    cant keep a good man down
  someone post the f91 flying death roombas
  i remember that dead hit me hard the first time i saw it it showed no gore but portrayed the easiness with one can get killed
  it would completely go against the tone of the show but id love a s3 where iok survives and becomes the main villain purely by virtue of everything falling in his favor despite actually fucking things up by any other metric  had he not died he wouldve had the best luck stat in all of gundam
  the gundam franchise is one of the only scifi settings i know where directedenergy weapons are portrayed as horrifically violent as they probably should be
  this made me laugh actually a sword that big wouldnt part him into two perfect halves it probably would have made him an unrecognizable mess inside the cockpit
  victory here    
  also a nice reminder to not lose your head    
  i like how as uso goes through that hes like ththis cant real all the battles are starting to get to my head as hes waving the beam saber around
  unless you happen to be the main character
  i could totally see him coming back via retcon i dont why or how but i could see it happening
    
  its so you hate seeing it as much as the characters do
war in the pocket is pretty brutal at times
look at this dude
bong gundam
  the head is the only weird part in all honesty
  whats the chin cable for
  power or coolant from my guess i like the look reminds me of a throat
  this is actually really cool
  got a zaku and gouf coming right up
  oh and i found these on pinterest if you were wondering cant find anymore by the author
  looks like hes in a neck brace
      banrise needs to hire this guy this is an intriguing idea read gimmick for a gundam au technology
  they look like evolutions of ftb for the barrel
this is probably the oddest gundam series to me i liked it but i cant articulate why
  it hit a lot of unconventional high notes that were pleasing but the story was sort of averagely mediocore then at times its insane
victory gundam isnt necessary to watch to understand any other entry right im going to watch it eventually but i dont feel like picking up another 51 episode series right now
  its not even canon anymore so you can watch it whenever
  is victory really not canon anymore
  it and virtually everything else that chronologically came after unicorn is now essentially noncanon to the uc timeline so not in that sense it gets referenced like every other gundam show though so watch it anyway besides its pretty good especially if you dont bother trying to think of it as uc
so what about turna gundam
  highest killcount of all gundam mcs  suit doesnt even have bullshit space magic  gets an entire squad of amazons to want to /ss/  drives three enemy commanders crazy with lust  you like it becuase uso is the chad of gundam protags
   an entire squad of amazons to want to /ss/  who all die
  highest killcount of all gundam mcs  how many
its a really grim and fun hero story  and despite being ridiculous as hell angel halo is a pretty neat endgame of all the newtype psychic shit going on throughout uc gundam  its probably my favorite gundam tied with zeta and 00 but its definitely not something for people that like the super hotblooded stuff like g gundam or mazinger and whatnot    also i just really want to put my penis in shaktis warm 12 year old vagina
  350
  also i just really want to put my penis in shaktis warm 12yearold vagina
  you /ss/ you die thats tominos message    that also means that  marbet didnt /ss/ usso but her husband oliver did  shakti either didnt sex usso or it doesnt count  katejina probably only gave usso a handjob or something thats why she didnt die
  thats why she didnt die  yet
  marbet didnt /ss/ usso but her husband oliver did  no i think the message here was that interracial marriages are doomed to fail the complete futility of olivers attack was just extra salt on the wound
  it isnt necessary to watch other older uc show but it help to bring the feel closer to home especially about the whole spacenoids and federation thing    spacenoids wanted total independence and total autonomy from federation  feds gave them  seconds later almost all colonies on each other throat those who are weak are now begging for the feds to intervene  feds despite weaken over years of constant spacenoids uprising still come to their aid even knowing it will cripple their economy  on a brink of total defeat they refuse to surrender echoes the same similar spirit show all the way back during oyw  threw everything in the field and when the effect of a certain super weapon were made public theyre all rushing back to earth stop it    quite to say seeing the feds from inept and corrupt to the most heroic faction in gundam is really nice
  people seems to forgot that usso destroy the zanscare fleet in a single blast with his v2 assault buster gundam
  even beyond that theres a scene in the later half of the show where hes actively trying not to kill everyone and just cant stop   like seriously the only reason he didnt get a nickname like white demon was because there were never any survivors
  well he do have a nickname its usso warcrime ewin
  ok im just going to send out a few warning shots and that will scare them off  why didnt you pieces of shit dodge it was easy  truly the hero we need
  you got that wrong he went into the control room for the keilas guilie and fired it at a zanscare fleet
  casually fly over enemy ms with wing of light fully activated  the ms is now completely disabled and now come crashing to the ground     and    casually uses his gundam light saber to vaporise bikini babe  eh its probably an illusion    usso is savage as fuck
  im pretty sure i remembered he blast one whole zanscare fleet with his v2 gundam
  nah youre misremembering uso used the giant dick and balls zanscare superlaser to annihilate that fleet for ms weapons only something as ridiculous as the twin buster rifle from wing or the satellite cannon from x could wreck an entire fleet    heres the v2 busters mega beam cannon in action he uses it to destroy a single zanscare warship at long range causing the rest of the fleet to raise beam shields in fear of being attacked next ill make a webm for the zanscare dickballs superlaser afterward
  and heres the scene of uso destroying the fleet it was a really long scene so i took the liberty of editing out character reactions and etc to focus on the weapon being fired and the results of the attack
  damn usso has superhuman strength he breaks the glass just by simply pressing it
my wives
  im just going to point out that literally everyone that messed with ussos harem died they might have taken down a waifu or two but none of them lived long enough to enjoy it   are you a hard enough dude to steal a tiny murder machines eye candy
  what do you expect from chars descendant
  i thought it was a fascinating piece of work from someone who at that time are clinically depressed     also the music i love victorys bgm
    youre going have to explain how the hell you came to this conclusion
  victory is solid its a shame tomino hates it so much and his fans do too as a result honestly its biggest flaw is the ordering of the first few episodes other than that its good
  victory is solid  i really wouldnt go that far its fun in a ridiculous way harley battleships shakti surrendering to the enemy for the nth time expecting things to be different chronicles thunk death but there is no way you can take it seriously and enjoy it
  good fights good characters and the story is told in a low key way that feels refreshing compared to the usual bombastic show off
  take one look at how sunrise treats everything that comes chronologically in the timeline after unicorn they dont give a damn about late uc stuff and theyd prefer if you forgot it entirely
  because at one point a guy piloting a fighter jet decides that the only way to stop a giant motorcycle battleship must be to be to kamikaze himself against the heavily armored wheel they use to steamroll entire cities
  and this immediately after he finds out his brown waifu is pregnant   oliver was looking for a way out
  what an asshole
i wonder if theyll make an underwater version
  was that what that new dad us soldier was attempting by raping a girl in japan
  so it is still canon got it
  katejina lived though
  she was part of it so that counts as an internal squabble
  a gunblaster aqua
victory taught me an important lesson about respecting women because if i dont ill be left behind when the zanscare steal the only submarine in my underwater city as it collapses
  harley battleships makes more sense than antigravity ships shakti giving herself up in the last episode had the specific goal of freeing the psychickers powering the angel halo and as for chronicles life and death its pretty much a mirror of chars char is a prince whose family was removed from power and he suceeds in taking revenge on the ones responsible for it and in the meantime finds a woman who understands him and he wants to fight for but ends up dead    chronicle was a common person suddenly elevated to royalty status and that has to fend off most threats to himself and his sister who he fails to protect ending up with him fighting for the sake of a woman who understands him but getting killed for it
  fpbp  somehow
  but that was the best part of the entire show
for some reason the moment i finished victory i liked it a lot more than i did while i was watching it
  some moments from it are insane but its pretty enjoyable
  theres something scary about a beam so large that it instantly wipes out all those people before they are even able to react not even microwaved like in seed just straight up poofed out of existence instantly as if you never even existed nor thousands of others gives me the shakes
  i cant articulate why    its because every episode feels like the middle 20 minutes of an hour long show especially early on    and its a real heart breaker given the sheer volume of good animation plus i really like the smaller more practical size of the mobile suits beam shields cool modular designs lots of stuff like that    i agree with the idea that its not canon and a defacto alternate universe its just too far removed people gotta remember victory just a year before ggundam is the first thing they made with no real direct link to the uc timeline its fairly obvious to me that victory is why they started doing nonuc series
  8/10    you got some people really well with this
its kind of amazing/disturbing how quickly uso gets past the deaths of the main characters he just gets fucked up for maybe the end/start of an episode and then gets over it externally
  he watched so many people die that eventually he just gets used to it he still had problems coping with his moms death for example
  kate was bestgirl she also made the best music
  he is able to get into the robot and do what needs to be done but in the down time hes still torn up by those hes lost and those hes killed if anything its admirable that he can go through such experiences without becoming jaded or cynical like amuro
  katejina is potato
i like the contrast of the angel halo being whats probably the least violent weapon in the uc but the most messed up in concept
  how is it not canon pls explain
  my theory is that in the final battle shakti got everyone above 18 to kill themselves using the angel halo it makes no sense that the adult crew on the reinforce jr wouldnt abandon ship during the kamikaze attack
with a purpose full grimace and a terrible sound    he pulls the spitting high tension wires down
mothra is his waifu do not steal or you will face dire consequences
megatron i am the better leader
bruticus am leader
im the only one with the economic knowhow to run this organization
  its amazing how jokes from a video thats 12 years old are still used to this day
  explain this then one eye
  oldfags never die
  what video
  ratbat was the best leader
should we expect onyx prime addon for siege shockwave
  
why is clancy so great
  because shes still the runner up to the best
  true also manga takeo kumagami for the win
  combat
  this basically shes a solid respectable second place and since her place under noa is so absolute you can like her without feeling like its conflicting with your true love
  i want to french kiss her like a wild animal
  anal sex material
  agreed with you and with your dubs    but thats every waifu anon so long as its the waifu you love
  russian combat
  is that from tng    what is up with oshii and women dancing at least that doesnt look as bad the crow lady in assault girls
    takeo    thats cute hows wong doing these days
  cause the you did it scene was hilarious
  did he get killed in the manga is anyone ever going to translate it into english fuck
  couldnt they have at least gotten a woman who wasnt anorexic
  he got stabbed but survived i think ill have to crack open my old manga
  yup it seems he lived after getting stabbed in vol 22  seems that kumagami might had a hand in letting him get away or at least saving his life  det matsui says they confirmed it was wong by getting a fingerprint from his wrist watch
  also bud gets adopted by nypd officer brady in america turns out kanukas partner black dude in the manga already has 5 kids so one more wont make too much of a difference
  seems that kumagami might had a hand in letting him get away    typical kumagami
  i thought got shot by a shaft security officer in the final volume
  nope knifed by the second in command of shaft security dude with the sunglasses and mustache  kurosaki shot the guy in the head after he had stabbed wong
  i really have to question kurosakis loyalty though the dude never seems to consider the possibility of betraying wong in the manga at all  instead kurosaki puts up with his crap and the fact he wants to keep his old cop girlfriend around  he knows what the smart thing to do is which is get rid of kumagami maybe in a fridge or something but kursosaki refrains because wong tells him not to with tears
    shut up fattie
what can i do to become based like him   im going to watch my first tokushit kikaider because it inspired the itano circus and i already hate jews
  well my advice is to rent a jet plane and try to experience gloc if you want to be truly based fly solo like a real man when doing this    also dont forget your jars of ammonia and bleach so you can open a portal to gensokyo before you lose consciousness
it would have won if they give it the bazooka
  it would have won if it has some gms as escort
      what do you mean would have at the end of the day one pilot survived and the other is ground chuck
  thats the tristan right i might be misremembering but didnt it win and then spare them
  the fact it was optimized entirely for amuro was probably a bigger obstacle
would won if woman didnt pilot it
im really tired of the chris lost meme she intentionally walked into a trap to prevent civilian causalities and at the end of the fight she was the one who walked away while bernie was burgers thats not winning
  thats the alex
  this
i am a gundam pilot
  haters say she sucks because she lost to a rookie in a zaku but ignores that she beat an ace/elite pilot in a custom suit
    people come off of shit like seed and wing and think that gundam is an auto win super sayin button or some bullshit but ignore the actual context and the tone of the story 0080 was going for its bull shit faggots who can only think in power level wank
  dat hair    goddamn this is why i miss 80s show
the fact the whole suit was specially built to be used by newtypes and amuro specifically was one of the biggest reasons why chris lost the fight with bernie the kämpfer got rolled over because it couldnt get through the chobham armor and once it did all it took was a single burst from the gatling to put it down thanks to its total lack of armor  and without the chobham armor alexs oversensitive controls meant that without a proper pilot it was working against chris as much if not more than it was working for her
  this really though its a shame that it didnt make it what would it have been like for amuro to pilot the alex
  rape lots and lots of rape he likely would have returned to the wb crew with it intact it was that good
  not an ace pretty sure she was a rookie too just one that was considered good enough to be a test pilot till they shipped it to the white base    char probably wouldve died
  zeon never develops the kampfer resources spent elsewhere  alex finishes and gets to amuro just before a baoa qu  resources are spent on finishing the zeong  char gets the perfect zeong and fights amuro in the alex  not sure who would pilot the rx78 if amuro got the alex though maybe sayla or hayato
  i dont think the kampfer was developed specifically for the particular mission 0080 focuses on
what if he had the gelgoog j
    it wasnt it was developed for hit and run assault missions like the one in 0080 but not for it specifically  as for who would get the gundam i think theyd probably give it to kai but honestly i have no idea which of the wb support pilots was the best it certainly wouldnt be easy for them to pilot it considering it was also set up for amuro near the end
  kai seems to be better than hayato but it could be the guntank being trash for the white base
  shes pretty dumb that she couldnt even see its an obvious trap
    putting aside that the alex clearly won anyway chris is unlikely to have used the bazooka if it was available given that the entire reason she went in to the forest after the zaku ii was because she wanted to keep civilian casualties to a minimum and using a bazooka against a mobile target has a high chance of creating stray shots thatll affect civilians        the alex was never going to make it to a baoa qu ever not even if zeon had never attacked side 6 for whatever reason the rx780nt1 was still in testing on christmas day 0079 when bernie attacked and the battle of a baoa qu was fought on december 31st 0079 with a peace treaty signed the next day and it takes a week to travel from one side to another even on a fast ship like the white base so even if they had decided jobs a good un wrap her up and ship her off on christmas day itself itd still arrive as the attack is happening even if it was sent on a fast ship theres no indication they were going to though as far as the show indicates while the alex is in final testing its not actually finished and itd still take at least a few more days to finish    the alex was built for amuro but it wasnt built for a baoa qu specifically because a baoa qu was kind of a surprise to both sides given that neither really expected the war to end there on that day they may not have even expected a battle there so soon given how quickly solomon fell due to the solar system really the alexs schedule wasnt set specifically to line up with a baoa qu or anything the federation started building it in hopes amuro could use it but it was just never going to get to him because the war ended too early    which lines up with the stories tone frankly since it adds one more layer of tragedy that everyone was fighting over something that was never going to make a difference regardless
  shes pretty dumb that she couldnt even see its an obvious trap      she literally knew it was a trap but went in anyways to protect the city the entirety of trap was built literally on the assumption that the gundam wasnt an asshole
its also worth pointing out that if they had wanted to ship the alex to a baoa qu they absolutely could have because none of the damage it suffered was catastrophic it had its head and one arm gatling cut off but both were intact beyond some tearing along the cut and a gash in the stomach armor all of which is repairable damage the kind of damage that is often repaired between episodes of 0079 or zeta on other units including the lead gundams they could have packed the unit on to a ship and repaired all of it in transit so that amuro received an intact unit at the other end if theyd really wanted to they never did though because the unit was still in testing and the war was over only a few days later         specifically chooses to walk in to a forest filled with smoke despite orders about the danger   apparently doesnt know its a trap    what makes you think she doesnt know its a trap and just not care
  
    well i imagine she did care but it was an issue of weighing taking her chances with that and fucking up the city even harder but ultimately i think the simple fact of the matter is that issue of skill aside chris is too nice to be a soldier
  not even if zeon had never attacked side 6 for whatever reason  i actually imagine it never wouldve been developed to start with if amuro hadnt had the chance to get in the gundam didnt matilda winkwinknudgenudge to bright that it was the kids drafted to wb that made jaburo command actually accept the existence and military value of newtypes to begin with
  would have lasted a little longer but the gundam has more firepower and armor than the gelgoog j
  kai had more onscreen kills than sayla and hayato laments to frau hes not as good at fighting as either of them
    bernie was too nice to be a soldier too thats kind of a theme of 0080 really that war tends to affect the lives of people who are ordinarily beyond that kind of thing        i think you might be getting side 6 and side 7 confused side 7 is where amuro lived up until the start of the show and where testing for project victory and the white base was taking place side 6 is where al lived and where the majority of 0080 takes place since the alex is being tested there i meant if zeon never knew of this or at least never tried to attack side 6 because the testing for the alex would proceed past christmas day left undisturbed and itd take longer than there was left in the war to transport the alex to the white base once the testing was finished even if it wrapped up before the war ended
   a baoa qu was kind of a surprise to both sides given that neither really expected the war to end there on that day   this anon gets it the only reason the war ended then was because zeon backstabbing kycilia shot gihren and then char killed kycilia eliminating both supreme commanders of zeons forces and government at once     the federation had no way of knowing that was going to happen and fully expected the war to continue to side 3
  she caught an ace off guard because she survived a lethal explosion due to armor thats the definition of winning because she had a better toy
  are you saying mischa was in a state of surprise and confusion so it was the alexs fault that he took a beam sabre when he was still at gunfighting range
  im saying if he was such a fucking ace that chris defeating him is a huge achievement worthy of celebration then he wouldnt have been stupid enough to get caught off guard
how do people claim that the person that survived wasnt the winner she killed two of the groups pilots with their mobile suits she was heavily injured in the last fight and the gundam was slightly damaged but she wasnt dead
  hey guys remember that time he won
  the third impact wasnt a fight
  well it helps that he was under the influence of some alcohol so his reactions were definitely slower than sober    and he didnt know about the arm gatlings he thought the alex was mostly unarmed except for head vulcans and that even with the kampfers light armor he could power through them
  hes russian they only work on alcohol
  everything is a fight if you look deep enough anon
  yup which is my point she didnt win by being skilled he lost by being drunk and not staying on guard im fucking nothing but even i could kill a black belt if he let me walk up behind him with a big enough knife killing mischa doesnt reflect well on her it just reflects poorly on him so its not much a of an accomplishment
  plenty of special forces operations are suicide missions just look at the st nazaire raid survival has nothing to do with victory
    shes not even heavily injured more likely shes just exhausted and thats why she requires assistance leaving the alexs cockpit we see her in the immediate aftermath of the only damage the alex takes that could have physically affected her and the only injury she takes is shrapnel to the arm which is going to be painful but not life threatening even when shes being helped out of the alex shes obviously conscious but is just draped over the guys shoulder and looks wrecked however when we see her in the epilogue she just has her arm in a sling being knocked around in combat and the stress of fighting so close to civilians probably wore her out        while special forces dont have to live to win they do have to successfully do something which bernie didnt because the alex was still usable unless youre going to argue that a severed head and torn waist are somehow catastrophic damage despite units in 0079 zeta etc surviving just fine with similar levels of damage it didnt reach a baoa qu because it was never going to given the timeline not because of bernie or the cyclops teams efforts the tragedy that they achieved nothing and their efforts were entirely in vain is part of 0080 the war ground them all up and spat them out despite them not even being necessary because the thing they were after would never have affected the war regardless everything in 0080 is pointless but it still happens it still fucks up everyones lives and its still tragic thats the point
  the only think that bernie was trying to accomplish at the end was to stop the colony from being destroyed too and that threat had already been dealt with which is part of the tragedy of the ending
forgot muh webm
  rare chris image
  she beat an ace/elite pilot  bernie wasnt an ace he told al that he was still 1 kill away if recall correctly bernie admitted later that he never actually shot down anybody
  hes referring to mikhail in the kampfer mikhail is an ace
konya wa hurricane  anata ni hurricane  konya wa hurricane  kanjite hurricane

  i want priss to gimme touch
  mad machinehurricane  fite me boomers
                
  its livejournal what were you expecting
  it is funny that i found this in a fan site of the early 00s        it is nice that there is a translation for the cd dramas if i knew how to sub and had a good pc i would make a video with the subs of dearka and yzak autism
  this is a work of art in all the wrong ways from the 800x600 desktop backgrounds and winamp skins to this
  i think its more autistic to actively search for this shit years after it stop being relevant
  i wish i knew how to find shit like that
  make her a protagonist of the next series if shes so autistic then
im 4 episodes in and from what ive gathered both wars prior to this one have killed off every smart person in the galaxy so the only people left are fucking retards and bright who is still horny for children piloting robots for him is that about right
  close
the colony had weed for air the cast gets serious again some 10ish episodes after they leave the colony
  yeah pretty much  and yeah shithole colonies are filled with amazingly stupid people
  bright who is still horny for children piloting robots for him    i liked to think that by this point in his career bright has seen random teenagers do so much crazy shit that hes letting them run wild and launch in whatever ms they want just to see which one will turn into the next newtype ace
wait until they leave shangrila before making judgement those first few episodes are like an overbearing apology for how seriously zeta took itself
  just like real life
the closest thing godzilla has gotten to mecha  do you like it /m/
mechagodzilla is the bees knees homie

zz is my least favorite gundumb   fuck chad and fuck veronica
  scans where
  yfw i have translated and edited it all but wont release it
  if youre not lying why
  back in my day people just released scripts as txt files  sip  id use the photocopier at my parents place to do layouts on copies of my sailor moon tanks felt good man
  if true then you are a jackass of the highest order
  english speakers will never appreciate the true genius of unicorn gundam until anon releases the translation  based
  i am entitled to things and youre a jackass for not giving them to me
  youre a jackass for flaunting it
  what would move you to release it name a price maybe enough /m/en here would be willing to chip in for it if it were reasonable
  minerva  not sure if legit
  war against shitposters      its not a matter of money it is a matter of principles    as long they keep shitposting about a single specific thing i wont release it
  fuck off xpearse
  mate you cant change the behaviors of an group of anonymous people just by holding a translation hostage theres too many variables like    them being truthful  them being emotionally invested enough in it  you having the ability to contact them    you may as well bitch on /qa/
  fuck off xpearseposter kill yourself
    is it true  we got new ideon stuff  even if its in uc timeline im happy
  nah its a gag short hasegawa drew in the 90s it just happens to explain of all the newtype shenanigans in the tomino shows and unicorn by linking it to ideon it also happens to explain minevas motivations in gundam uc turns out she was inspired by judau the reincarnation of cosmos
  i dont even care about it but damn  youre an idiot
  are you actually holding onto the giant god manga as the laplaces box of /m/
  as long they keep shitposting about a single specific thing  which one
  the neo zeong was zeons attempt at replicating the crimson giant god of jupiter    woah
  buy the actual manga then show the receipt to receive scanlations    is that how it goes
  see a giant gm make a zeong    no wonder it failed
anyone has raw might try to translate it when i have free time
    i doubt hes going to say hed have no reason to be so coy in the original post if he was open to revealing that information not that itd do any good trying to use temptation to stop shitposting is like trying to tempt the ocean theres not a hope itd work more likely itd just egg shitposting on if he doesnt want to release it more power to him but its purely for his own ego he isnt at the end of the day
    there is no gundam canon
  sinanju is more of a gm than a zaku though
  its bundled as a tankoubon with that v gundam side story that had the junker zz
    there clearly is tominos uc works all reference previous shows in various ways building a lone of continuity even turn a and greco do so too though in less definite ways
  the stickyup shoulders  the cuboid arms  the long legs  the colour scheme  now that you mention it
in the manga char ends up with the remains of gigantis thats why cca neo zeon has all the newtype tech freshly extracted from ideon
i remember some people talking about how the movie has a lot of ideon sfx and how the psycoframe is basically ideonite    does anyone have a list of things that happened/effects that were used
  yeah because this has worked before
first there was guyver advocacy now gundam advocacy
  fuck that where are my jupiter adventures with judau roux and that one puru from 3 to 11 that managed to survive
  above manga sez roux dumped judau
would the ideon even properly function in a universe without ide
  i cant tell i this is a newfag brainlet or troll how should i respond
manga scans are in the gundam wiki ignore the redditor who says he has the translations
  if you mean the evolve puru thats apparently mineva i remember seeing scans that had all characters in that evolve and the purus name was mineva
  comic sans    good keep it
    /m/ ideon vs every mobile suit made and every faction of gundam turn a and x included who wins    inb4 sunrise

you know i think ive finally notched onto what i think could help improve the infinity va for kouji hes got a nice yell for when he holds on a note but the attack calls lack a bit of punch/oomph at the end southern cross knife and scrander cut both show that the yells nice enough but kind of fizzles in impact at the tail end of the shouts
  so you are saying kouji should be shirtless and have a full body cutin for every attack
ive only played a few srw games arent votoms mechs front mission or battletech tier wouldnt the nations that use them get wrecked in any conflict
man im late as fuck i didnt realize the pun in the official website for srw t        teradaaaaaaaa
what new attacks will mazinger z have for this installment the spirit bomb rocket punch is a given but im hoping the point blank iron cutter makes it in
trails of cold steel in srw when
ssss gridman is srw when  
you know with new story finally having its characters in and perhaps some plot since previously it had been in only as an extra upgrade for show what does this say for anything shion might get as an upgrade is he going to have everything sirbines going to have right at the outset with no upgrade stuck with sword and sword harder so we have to wait for sword hardest    dare i even think that theyll use the moment they have the va to do voicework for a comboattack if not for x show himself would be lacking in upgrade potential aside from night camouflage
  combination attack as an upgrade for both
  whats the fastest turnaround a series has had between debuting and appearing in an srw anyway two years    in that case id say youd have to wait ay least until whatever game comes out at the end of 2020
  heero and gridman in the same srw when
happy lesson in srw when 
  one month was the fastest iirc with the original srw and f91 debuted a month before the original srw first came out
  several months infinity
final form of mazinger z isnt called mazingest z    final form of shin getter isnt called shin gettest
srwa scenario in xomega
  are axel and lamia going to get attacked by discount char and the three stooges again
yang wenli is transported to the srw universe with a full fleet how does he fare /m/
i fucking hate beecha
  there were trider enemies in shin
  sword  sword harder  sword hardest    sirbines attack list always cracks me up
its weird that they keep using zz but no haman she better be a secret in t
i cant believe ryujinmaru fucking died
  he was brought back to life and became ryuoumaru though
  no itll be  sword  sword hard  sword harder  sword even harder  sword hardest  sword even hardest
  for once t is a game with stuff thats roughly on par with your average scopedog the arhans the space wolves and the bebop ships    on the other hand t also contains gunbuster which can take out thousands of enemies with a single move and survive planetsized explosions dont expect logic with powerlevels in srw
  not every character always gets an upgrade you know but if anything shion will probably get some aura power super mode stat buff but no new weapons if theyre gonna try to force an upgrade on everyone im most curious about how theyre gonna pull that for spike and harlock though the latter is mostly because ive never watched harlock
  see     stonest sunshine
  what about sword hard
   scopedog_defeating_antispiralswebm
  sword hard  sword hard 2 sword harder  sword hard with a vengeance  live free or sword hard  a good day to sword hard
    what about a good day to sword hard
    and then the final one simply called sword
  im most curious about how theyre gonna pull that for spike  have him unlock a new attack after his confrontation with vicious in which he either opens the hatch can the swordfish do that and fires his gun or just has the bang cutin before firing his cannon
  not every character always gets an upgrade you know    this is true upgrades of some kind are usually the goto way to include a character into the plot and give them a moment to shine though which is something im always a fan of giving every series main within an srw a moment or two to take the center stage is nice even if theres inevitably going to be some series that dominate the cast    its kind of why i like ux nearly every stage gives you something new and pretty much every series gets moments to shine even the ones with the most minimal of plot like miku and dancouga nova
lost universe in srw when
  spaceship was best girl
bebops fighters will only have a couple of shitty moves  no squad system  whats the fucking point of having them theyre going straight to the fucking bench
  probably soon because they can just reskin vs might gaine and nobody can tell the difference
  challenge runs  albeit the game is going to be stupidly easy anyway so its not like it matters what tier theyre on    though truth be told im having a hard time deciding who to bench in t this is like the first game in which i feel like i want to deploy every single unit since i find almost all of them to be pretty unique and cool in their own way only things i know i definitely want to bench are the uc gundam cast again unless the crossbone guys get a new unit  doubtful and the nadesico cast
  you mean  chirico_pistols_antispiralswebm    im still pissed you couldnt have ange machine gun granzeboma but i guess wataru using his sword against granzeboma is better anyway
theme of t is revenge  we getting edgelord ogs this time
  yes that
  bench the boring returners like trider and shin getter
daitarn3 acted as a bootleg sun for selenes flowers  thats kinda cool
  i hope
dd already have edgelord
      now shall we have   master_asia_defends_against_buster_beamwebm
oh look the coollooking sirbine is returning again  but whos that nerdlooking nobody piloting it where the hell is muh show
    this has better animations than z3/v/x/t    srw when
  haman mashymre and chara all as secrets  i wish this would happen theyre the best
caring about modern day srw games
  i only have shin r 64 and half of impact left to play though
  eh thats a dlc unit the average animation on g gen genesis are g gen spiritstier which are only on par with the gba games
  gundam build fighters
  play then them anon
would you recommend a new player for srw  a portable    i would if they love gundam 08th ms team dragonar or daimos
  no unless you want to experience pain and suffering
  this has better animations than z3/v/x/t  get some goddamn glasses
  would you recommend a new player for srw  v or x is probably the best choice although if they want to try the series out without paying money then id say j is the best place to start
when does raioh get upgraded in og i really want to hear what the remixed theme for the next form will be
  if the next game finally pulls the trigger on the alpha 3 plot then well get dairaioh or dylioh or whatever the fuck theyre gonna call it then
  arado and sanger gets their upgrade way before alpha 2 plot starts
  no its not as hard as people hyped it to be but youd want to get the basics down first play r or w
  og1 gba og2 gba or srw j english translation    theyre all in english and you can grasp the basics of the game from playing them
  well their plots in og2 are basically repeats of their alpha 2 plots while touma has yet to run into baran doban yet
        soon
looks like its his turn for an srw debut boys
since when is the yapoolgundam wikia part of the op pasta
  great
  a portable can be difficult even if youve played srw games before definitely not a good choice for a new player
  nani
so how could they weave the ds/pspera plots together for next ogs
  z2 needs z1 first  oe can be inserted easily
  wing appeared in shin before it actually aired iirc a super weird version of wing but yeah
  would he have a beam penis like the mecha in that one short animation that would truly be worth of being called the hyper weapon for it is one literally
  we already have master asia facetanks meioh
  build fighters in srw thats not xo would be great but no this absolutely doesnt look better than the z engine games its somewhere in the upper half of animations at best and thats only if the blocky 3d doesnt immediately turn you off
  looking forward to crowes firebug days and the original version of acp phis
  like with everything else in a lazy and half assed way    w is super easy the trailers always existed its just that nobody noticed it until then and nobody ever bat an eye to the existence of the familys super special spaceship    atreem too always existed but nobody noticed its existence before ditto with the l originals and el presidente is a survivor from the shadow mirror world taking over the world after kicking the ass of edgy kyosuke and desiring to also conquer ogverse because of course they will keep milking the shadow mirror universe as much as possible
  make another og universe for post w games
  make another og universe with all the games nobody gives a shit about  great idea
  z1 will be there so thats at least one game people will care about
bros i think they can beat my ass irl
      z saga is postz3 finale hibiki and friends comes from the z multiverse to do stuff related with factors or some other shit    considering og went out of its way to state shit like ingram and cobrays time diver nonsense is unique through all the multiverse and only one can exist odds are that the same is true for the spheres and sphere reactors
  cell and broly  based
ks crystal/krystal heart already hinted in moon dwellers and axel might have hinted about l because he talked about the moon in shadowmirror world    so yeah theres no new og no reboots etc    og is the magnum opus of srw and will continue because after all every other srw game is the previous cycle to og
     no strain    while that would be nice studio fantasia went bankrupt how would that work
  but anon that doesnt make much sense with modern srw that invokes the rule of cycles in their own continuities as well    quite a few of them blatantly uses concepts of rebirth or recreation of universes in their lore and it is a critical plot in some of them even that leaves no room for them to be previous iterations before og
  should be soon as early as next year  green river voices gridman so that is a huge possibility
  only if zegapain debuts in the same game
  and web diver as well
  and digimon as well
  they are all previous cycles to og period
  the rights have to be owned by somebody contact whoever that is
      i hope the president gets a good va because legislate laser needs a ham as powerful as that name
  but anon og is the previous cycle the existence of cybuster and the srw 4 originals in x and v shows that og is old and busted and those are the new hotness in brand new cycles
    this in hd would be sweet
  wtf rance is now /m/
  always was with shit like marias tulip tank the tousho and toushin mecha plus miscellaneous mecha homages
  atreem probably exists because weve had fuck all to do with the greater solar system yet everythings been earth based for quite a while    could be an excuse to use the trailers too since earth hasnt given a shit about the colonies because preoccupied etc they had to take matters into their own hands hence the formation of the trailers etc
  the thing is that when you have colossal interplanetary/intergalactic empires like the zuvorg and balmar it is pretty much impossible for a planet with advanced and intelligent life like atreem to have gone unnoticed    those guys should have enough power to prevent anything happening to atreem if it was a vassal or allied planet like for example impeding edaxs forces from wrecking it
  theyre like fury or gardisord very far away that only going through a crossgate will allow you to reach atreem
  what a lazy cop out and the milkyways crossgate was destroyed anyways so it cannot be used anymore that excuse
  id assume that ks plot would play into a bit of gunbusters idea of time dilation atreem couldve gotten fucked by edax significantly before balmar and zuvorg got developed enough to be able to help fend off the edax    bullshit some cryo/stasis tech and send some survivors out that dont show up until significantly after the fact could explain mists personality should yhey keep it the same
  crossgate destruction doesnt even mean much though if going by what alpha 3 shows here    
  tangential but i just wonder if mist will get called out by the other characters having unpopular characters be shat on is not uncommon in the licensed games but i wonder if the developers are willing to do it to a character native to the franchise
  i would still like a srw with humansized/toy based mecha    build fighters would be in for sure not try fuck try
  what is la gias crossgate
  a trap for any travellers for they would be permastuck in la giars unless they beg that priest to get them to the earthworld
srw t has the jupiter empire  the jovian federation  a bunch of bebop shit that might happen around jupiter  zmaster and the power at jupiter  and  black hole bomb made out of the planet jupiter  is this like the feddie version of a colony drop
  t is jupiter the game    mars srw when
  wasnt that j layzner and nadesico spent a lot of time there and it even tied into the og plot a bit iirc
  no j was nadesicos game but not the show the battleship
  nah besides js climax was the moon anyway
  not until they can wrest idolo/dolores from konami
  dido put some shoes on piloting robots with bare feet is a recipe for disaster what if you stub your toes midbattle
    considering the vocal hatedom he has i wouldnt be surprised giving him the perspective to see that atreem was a lot more shitty than he thought could be the best thing to happen to him
  oe ended with his introduction in the last red shoulder two full arcs before his death      since previously it had been in only as an extra upgrade for show what does this say for anything shion might get as an upgrade    same thing he got in compact 3
  i hope that he only gets proven right time after time after all the og earth gets fucked by aliens gods dimensional entities and etc every few months and therefore is a horrible shithole even its own inhabitants are assholes who kills their own people    meanwhile everything was better on atreem until the edax came
i really think they will fuse season 1 and 2 of rayearth and still make emeraude the final boss of it she is more iconic than the other bitch
  would be pretty hard to pull it pretty much sephiro got invaded because cephiro was pillarless and it was a once on a lifetime chance as only the magic knights can kill a pillar otherwise no dice in anything else trying to bruteforce the power away from the pillar
  they could make that this time emeraude in love completely fucks the barrier and drops the defenses to zero cuw the other fags attacking if they go with the normal route it would mean zagato and emeraude must be killed as soon the magic knights become playable because they got their mechas close to season 1 end
  or they get them slightly before that and you get 2/3 stages against emeraude
  i honestly have a hard time thinking how to make zagato and emeraude more than the magic knights debut and prologue mission/s     does any other show in t have a mean to revive dead people the most i can imagine is that they are unwillingly revived later on during s2 and due reasons fights the heroes or joins them whatever    another alternative would be if they take a page from valkyrie profile 2 and dimensional displacement of the pillar to another world cuts off emeraudes ties with cephiro as its pillar and therefore cephiro decays all the same    personally i think they will just plain die early on and maybe through activating some secret flags appears as one stage only reinforcements for the rayearth finale because something about willpower making miracles a tiny bit of regret for abandoning duties and do one last thing before they feel at peace and be all lovey dovey for all eternity fucking off to the afterlife and they could pass their mashins to suitable rayearth pilots like lantis because why not
  oh look the somehow much beloved chad serial rapist that pretty much 85 of mecha protagonists would try to beat bloody on sight for his behavior time to shove him into xo and no other srw ever
  if they can be perfectly fine with the more violent and crazier versions of the getter team they can be perfectly fine with just a harmless asshole who saves the day more than he ruins it
  does any other show in t have a mean to revive dead people  well we got dunbine going all in with the reincarnation shit this time not to mention what happens during the finale of ggg not that i remember the exact mechanism behind the latter could have been a one time only thing so maybe    but again i dont think they will be the debut/prologue unless the game wants to be super bleak plenty of dunbine stuff they could go along with hell you could even have them fighting alcyone and/or ascotts monsters before they get to emeraude and zagato      reminder that teams have counted master therion and masaki kihara among them at times
  we got new one time and the other getter teams arent really violent and/or crazy    for all that people say the armageddon team was crazy or violent theyre really not they can be brutal in combat but thats more animation quality and isnt really their defining attributes
  dude theyve literally worked with zeorymers masaki aka the icicle rape guy
  i remember toeigetter hayato viciously murdering somebody with a football did they complete neuter their more malicious traits in srw because i dont think the heroes would feel comfortable with a killer like him
  just bring back shin kouji infinitys kouji is lame and id rather get kaiser/zero shit than have boringass infinity z   tetsuya only shows up for like 2 seconds only to job to dr hell of fucking course  infinity is lame
start playing t  get through intro scene  opening text crawl  text crawl is voiced  earth has been devastated with mankind fighting for scraps planetside  the elite all live in the colonies above  background slowly zooms in on a familiar person in red clothing sitting in a chair  not all is well among the colonies either space pirates roam the hyperspace highways and bounty hunting has proliferated as a means of easing the burden on the overtaxed police forces  in the midst of all this a tournament is being held to find the one person to be the king of all space someone who could finally turn this sad situation around who will win this year only time will tell  man in the chair stands up  rips off his fake eyepatch  gundam fight all set ready goooo
  at least i can imagine inouva being fought pres1 final battle if terada wasnt lying about themes of revenge i can imagine him surviving his encounter instead of dying and bitterly becoming a recurring opponent after zagatos death
  they just ignore the fact that yes hayato killed quite a few people who happened to be dinosaurs but he only found out afterwards
  id rather get kaiser/zero shit than have boringass infinity z    that has nothing to do with shin infinity could do that too
  it could but it wont at least not for several years  not to mention that infinity koujis va is the worst by far
    yes alright both of them are several magnitudes worse than him but still neither of them would constantly look for a chance to drag your teams female pilots aside and have their way with them over and over so id still say rance would be a major nuisance and hated by almost everyone
  dont worry about it hell show up with the cross ange cast theyll all enjoy it and no one will care
  or he just makes some pervy comments and gets dragged off elsewhere for comedy they glossed over or skipped the rape parts of every other literal rapist so i doubt they wouldnt do the same if they somehow decided to include rance   either way though thats one never ever thats really really never ever
  wow what a surprise that in the movie explicitly dedicated to mazinger z great mazinger gets pushed to the side so mazinger z can take the spotlight  who couldve foreseen that
  complaining about tetsuya getting the shaft when thats been the case for literally decades
  i was blinded by his showing in x and v
  at least srw gives tetsuya love  reminder that he is the mc of  gaiden
  tetsuya already got a hell of a break in the previous two games where hes a pretty major character in at least one of them and even got his own kaiser equivalent all for a series where he was already dead  if great mazinger gets some impressive attacks and infinity tetsuya gets major focus they can easily do it
  i would think it would either be a combo attack or a transformation into pic for a final attack apparently its from hobby magazine stories or something it uses the power of the fairy princess whose soul is in the shield or something id love to actually find some of the aura phantasm lore and read it
  if infinitys plot is done accurately youll get him in the opening stages and wont get him back until the last couple of stages
  well bellbine is the one they made an action figure of so if were getting anything from aura phantasm it would be that doubtful though theyd list aura phantasm as part of the cast list if we were getting it right
  or maps
  zegapain already has debuted in srw
  to say nothing of the fact that they even did a reenactment of his original debut from the movie in their shin versions    
        none of this makes sense and its also not necessary youre gonna get the mashin and then just keep going with the plot of other shows for a number of missions zagato willl ally with some other evil faction because all he cares about is killing the magic knights so they cant hurt emeraude about halfway through the game you kill him you cant save every boss to the end game some have to go early and this is perfect case for that
  and any baldr games as well  fuck sekai for keeping sky at bay
oh poor tetsuya always second banana  at least he has a banana
  grendizer is ugly
  i kinda want them to do rayearth so accurately that the girls show up in like the second stage and join the crew of the arcadia but they dont do anything for like ten stages and just kinda sit around being a greek chorus while actual mecha battles happen
  depends on the franchise like how gundam lisences msv separately now but bx used the silverion hammer from that ggg ps1 game without listing it
  well as long emeraude is a climax boss i am happy
  i believe sirbines shield is just from aura phantasm and never shows up in new story so it wouldnt be impossible to see things from it
if ultraman got in what units would he have
  kill yourself faggot    
  i dont really think that could work unlike most shows where the heroes passively react to the schemes of the villains the magic knights were going on a beeline straight to zagato only taking detours for rpg upgrades like escudo weapons and the mashin    it would pretty much go against their duty to take a detour to deal with other series meanwhile s2 has a more flexible format about what can they do so long they are at time to fend off attacks from the three invading worlds i really expect the lovers to go down early and do once a while s2 events
  we had a banana but we didnt get to keep it
  a major problem with this is that dead zagato  insane emeraude this mean zagato and emeraude must be fight on the same stage she is supposed to go full crazy as soon zagato dies and must be deal immediately or else world destruction your idea implies emeraude will not try to fucking destroy everything for several stages more and that doesnt fit
  theyre not exactly going to have a choice when they get thrown out of cephiro in the middle of their quest even if they remain in cephiro theyll probably still have to deal with drakes army in the meantime
  will we get maximum hd drekkage in t
  sr point defeat zagato within x turns  victory conditions defeat emeraude
  i doubt emeraude would have issues summoning back the magic knights did it once can do it again    and assuming drake tries to pull his shit odds are that he wouldnt be able to do it during season 1 events due the same reasons the three isekai world couldnt invade before emeraudes death     or i dunno i dont know very well how aura battler dunbine magic works can the aura road connect to worlds other than the regular earth that could bypass the need of a dead pillar to penetrate into cephiro
remind me something is not zagatos younger bro suppose to get his mecha at one point if he does then secret unit
  theyre not gonna detour because they want to theyll be forced to deal with other stuff thats what always happens in srw the earth is about to be destroyed by aliens but we have to fight these titans or zeon or whatever faggots first because theyre attacking us right now and zagato will definitely be allied with someone else because theyre not gonna make an entire map where zagato is literally the only enemy hes gonna have allies and youll have to fight those first which might take a few missions too
  i assume byston well and cephiro will just be different regions of the same magic world
  whatever the case jacoba aon is probably far more powerful than emeraude is though she never worked with drake shes not very bright though so shell be the wildcard in how all this plays out assuming she shows up anyway
  expert mode just get the victory condition and youll auto get the sr point
  map both
  ultimate force zero
  come to think of it thatd be the easy way to do it just have the dunbine plot start at the midpoint where everyone gets sent to earth and jacoba aons magic prevents emeraude from summoning anyone back the girls pick up their robots maybe get into a few skirmishes with alcyone get sent to earth and find their way back after the old hags magic wears off
  odds are that zagato will be assisted by inouva in beast form and probably some monsters and then immediately be followed by emeraude after losing her shit    wouldnt be the first time a stage is entirely dedicated to a single series i remember megazone having its own one/two stages exclusive to their plot in srw d to serve as a prologue to their involvement in ds plot
  lantis and yeah he went over to autozam and kicked around for a while as a wandering blade theres a flashback to how he and eagle met where he had his own autozam mech in the vein of fto and gto so bringing that out could be cool
  come of think of it alcyone first shows up riding a unicorn and lantis has this horse be interesting if they somehow had them show up riding those as battle units
  touya
  like vega in her motorcycle in r and mx i can get behind that
  damn dude suffers from a big case of clamp anatomy
  all for a series where he was already dead    episode 1/2 of shin implies hes still alive      sirvest is from something tomino wrote as an alternative mc robot its been hacked into final at one point
  i love tetsuya in v and x so much losing him and mazinemperor g is the biggest disappointment in t for me personally
now that bebop is getting in i feel that basically gives the ok for any sci fi anime nowso this when 
i think it is necessary to remind everyone that other than that 1 fight sequence mazinger infinity sucks ass and im not even sure srw can fix it
  i thought the tomino byston well novels didnt have aura battlers at all
  to my understanding the biggest issue with mazinger infinity is the lack of action yeah just people talking in very static shots right thats not really an issue which translates well into srw since by nature of the game theres going to be action and fighting in every single stage
  its just not very gripping theres not big payoff and also the plot is very dumb i guess that last one is not really an issue for srw
    its pretty funny how massive he is compared to hikaru
  idk personally those dont seem like big issues for srw even if the plot isnt gripping its not the only one were following and the lack of payoff can easily be fixed by combining the climax or whatever the issue is with something else not saying t will fix any of these issues but srw has done more with far less in the past
  youre a big guy
  big dude
    damn the kill count here is hilarious    tomino wasnt fucking around with his depression
i need that gxs solty rei image
    out of the remaining anime that made a srw appearance which deserves to have completed english subs next
  
  why does trider keep getting into games i dont understand
  you should ask that question about daitarn 3 that has been around since srw 3
  so im not 100 because it might be something of a mistranslation but i did some research on the thing when a friend found it in an f/final hack whatever its original source was tomino was responsible for it and it has nothing to do with neo byston well predates it by a fair amount i think      the biggest issue with mazinger infinity is the lack of action    it had plenty of action though more than the mazinkaiser movie for sure      outside of z2 and z3 it has been in three fucking games it only looks like its been in a lot because z2 and z3 are inflating the totals like dancouga nova
    because theyre cheap
  it had plenty of action though more than the mazinkaiser movie for sure    im just restating what ive heard on /m/ countless times i never actually got to see the movie went to the theater with my friends but they didnt have the drives for the movie or whatever so we just sat in a dark empty theater for 15 minutes and got refunded except i had already tossed my ticket so i lost like 15 bucks out of the deal
  i was under the impression that it was a powered up form for sirbine but i could be totally wrong now i really want to know for sure what its actually from
  literally big guy for her also  we have a love triangle between our mc the knight guy and the evil guys brother wat to do  kill the knight guy  what the fuck clamp
  sounds like clamp being clamp
  thats the animes doing he lives in the manga manga also doesnt have hikarus psycho lesbian clone
gxs thread trying to say claw man did nothing wrong  wew
  it had a fuckload of action arguably too little time on less combatty moments      definitely not
  the unit he piloted in the flashback is almost identical to the gto the faceplate the chest shape and the color placement are slightly different aside from that it seems like the same model if the gto is in the game as a unit unlikely it wouldnt be too much work to add the other one as well  though i dont think theyre gonna bother going out of their way to make lantis playable hes important to the story because of how he makes hikaru feel but he doesnt actually do anything despite being hyped as powerful by clef he fights some generic monsters in the wild fights alcyone for a bit blows a hole in the nsxs hull and gets kidnapped by nova thats gonna be a mission by the way rescue lantis from nova hes gonna be stuck in her mashin and shes gonna use his lightning spell against you
  great teacher onizuka in srw when
  at least i can imagine inouva being fought pres1 final battle    definitely as they can do a repeat of the snes game and fudge inouva to grow mechsized when he reverts to his original bestial form     i can imagine him surviving his encounter instead of dying    sadly no inouva is afaik zagatos familiar ie zagato is whats tying him to cephiro corporally zagato goes inouva goes
  do you think ishimura kouji is lame too because ill fight you on that one
  tetsuya getting shat on just mirrors japans opinion of the character they really dont like him and will forever be not muh kouji
  kamile doesnt want to be there
  one of these things is not like the other
whats up with the secret scenarios in alpha 3 and how do you access them akurasu doesnt even so much as mention them
  iirc you have to clear the game with all mcs
  play the game normally  go to the scenario chart and choose them from there
i want it to shine in srw like this  
  but he doesnt actually do anything despite being hyped as powerful by clef    remember that mirror amulet he gives to hikaru at one point to protect her yeah he kind of ends up channeling magic through it to absorb and reflect back an otherwise lethal direct hit from iirc the series final bigbad and said bigbad had no problem whatsoever with busting through the magical barriers clef erected around the castle those went down in pretty much one swoop    so yeah lantis is bloody goddamned strong once he starts actually giving a fuck that just doesnt happen until after eagle bought the farm and then mainly because it was eagles dying wish spoken while saving lantis from nova and regalia that lantis protect and look after hikaru
  its the girl isnt it      beautiful
  i know that but it was still an indirect/support role i mean he never did anything that warrants having him playable as a pilot with a unit the only reason to do it would be if they want somebody to give hikaru and eagle a love bonus
has anyone played the ex mode in alpha 3 sounds like a fun challenge but not being able to upgrade weapons makes me think itll turn the game into a terrible slog
  i did do a run of it to unlock special mode for the game all i can really say is the bad ending counts as a clear and is the least tedious ending to geto n exhard
  what  said iirc there was some side material or other where the question came up of who hikaru would choose and the answer was hikaru wouldnt choose she sees nothing wrong with having them both    i guess thats just the level of innocence and personal certitude you have to have to be the pillar
  whos the middle one
  probably reideen as its the most important of those that you listed
   side material  she flat out says it in the manga
    that doesnt mean she wants both though the very next thing she says is that she loves them both like she loves umi and fuu and everyone else manga hikaru is literally too pure for romance
    kore ga na    
rayearth is now /m/ material and nobody can complain about it  what is this timeline
  dont you mean cowboy bebop rayearth always was /m/ material
  i guess but i bet you never expected the rayearth in srw is impossible to actually be destroyed
  i can keep complaining all i want but im not upset over rayearth being in t to the contrary i think rayearth probably works much better as a video game than as an anime which makes it all the more astounding how tedious the snes game was
  the snes game  tedious  what it was fucking easy hell i got the true ending without even knowing i literally learned that there was a bad ending yesterday
  yes it was easy but it was also extremely monotonous dragon warrior tier shit no equipment like 3 spells and an attack option thats all the gameplay you get enjoy your random battles
  delicious tomboy
  looks like a fem ryouma
  3 spells  what
    huh i had heard about grendizer giga before but didnt realize it was completely unrelated to the original series
  a hot blooded young man with passion for justice
i hope gunbuster will get its jupiter bomb as its 1/1 ammo final attack  i am bored with its subpar super inazuma kick
  do you have the hack
  translation a hothead with autism
dido mech looks stronger than every previous ogs mechs
  bern bunnings from aura battle dunbone
  wouldnt be the first time somebody is given for no reason the secret unit treatment i mean literally no reason to have bontakun who like lantis mostly fought human level opponents and never did anything important ended up becoming a recurring unit even when it is just plain inferior to arbalest/laevanteinn
  they add bontakun because its funny its a good reason
  and they put in a glorious amount of effort for it pretty much every single boss it can fight in j and w has a reaction to it iirc
  is he a char
  hes a fucking failure that put the mask on out of shame and promised not to take it off until he could beat shou he never did
  so hes a total char got it
  kinda sorta
rewatching valvrave  kinda glad its not appearing in the mainstream games anytime soon because it needs a massive s2 plot overhaul to be any good and when was the last time a srw game bothered to rewrite a series plot for the better age in bx
  evangelion and seed
  v made evangelion a much better show
  how so
  needing s2 dumbed down for the lowest common denominator
  it was more fun and shinji was a man  nerf was not stupid
  seed  which game was this l did seed destinys plot a solid i know       eva  ill take your word for it the only eva stuff ive seen in v so far is asuka insulting might gaines justice and this firmly cementing her as worst girl
  which game was this    z overhauled the fuck out of destiny
  s2 fix really means jettison shoko out of the nearest airlock never getting over jew senpai    also s2 was dumbed down too much it had a bunch of potential that was never really fleshed out the whole broken pedestal plot with xeins saki actually doing dealings with cain like the first trailers hinted at what the fuck was with those flash forwards and what circumstances caused lelf and harutos test tube baby come about in the first place
tfw ts ending theme would be blue
  they have shinji transfer to school before the angels start attacking so he already has friends he wants to protect when he first sorties in the eva also he has a lot of positive reinforcements in dudes like kouji and ryoma and talking with hathaway of all peolpe makes him realize having a shitty relationship with your dad may not be so weird those things are good dont get me wrong but the game also has all its eva plot condensed in like 4 stages around the middle and then the characters are just there without much presence i wouldnt say it makes it a much better show also it was rebuild so asuka and rei barely exist as characters
  i havent watched vvv since it aired and dont remember did haruto and lelf have a baby
  those flash forwards and the free space for improv they create make for a far better srw plot hook than retooling the second season just because a core thematic point caused peak melodrama just my 2 cents    besides the real fix would have been not capturing the space submarine fucking obvious bait and haruto bit it just because he didnt want to be that guy and harass a grieving lelf
  the little prince in the flashforwards literally has harutos eyes and lelfs hair everyone was memeing him as their love child from the get go       yeah youre right about the flashforwards being a better plot hook but a world with dead jew senpai and no sugarcoffee is a world i dont wanna live in a s2 rewrite would let both jew and haruto live    also yeah the pilots being monsters was a theme but ill never not roll my eyes at shoko handing the enemy their trump card and then going  when the enemy promptly turns around and stabs them in the back its like she forgot that the reason they declared independence was because everyone was trying to screw them over
do you anons think we would see heroman again for the next srw after t as banpresto seems to be taking the western countries into account lately it would be a neat homage to stan lee to bring back the one mecha anime he was part of
  only if that srw also has dragon knight lucifer and have rance jobbing to schneider multiple times
  is megaman in
    where have you been
  wonder if theyll surpass that this new year by bringing x and zero
  dd is a mainstream game i dont like mobile but lets not pretend its a side project here dd gets an animated intro and like four og bots designed by big names       not to mention the mess that is the galactic empire they never fleshed out theyll be better off not mentioning it
  ive never understood how some people that arent rape victims themselves have such a hateboner for rance
icey in srw when
  i have nothing against rance or his games but thats like saying i dont get how people who arent murder victims can hate murderers
do you prefer mazinkaisers that are separate units or mutated mazingers
  separate units so i can put boss in mazinger z
  its just people talking without having played his games or at least watched the 01 ovas    some people really exaggerates his rapism shenanigans most of his conquest are consensual and most of the rape victims were evil villainesses that he disciplined with sex rather than straight killing them
  this  but putting boss in the kaiser instead
  im not a rance expert in any way but on the only ova i watched he is hired to save a kidnapped girl finds her tied up and blindfolded and just rapes her himself before taking off the blindfold and blaming it on the kidnappers
  can you do that in x by the way or is kaiser locked on kouji
  most murderers arent cool dudes
the real question is will rances mech try to get freaky with the other mechs
  nobody let him near valsione
  he can get away with doing really despicable shit even to people who have done nothing to earn it because i think hes so fucking rad and oozes charisma
  kaiser is locked to kouji as is mazinger z so you cant even swap boss into z once kouji upgrades
who wants to bet the rayearth girls and maybe dunbine cast too will be isekaid from regular japan and not ts main earth
  it would have a literal hyper weapon i bet beam penis or something similar
  doesnt rebuild 1 focus heavily on rei its not till rebuild 2 that the introduction of mari dilutes the pool
  isekai  was dunbine the first show to ever do that shit
  so when was the last you could do that was it fucking alpha 3 im pretty sure ova kaiser is always locked too
  dont think so but its still one of the better executions of the concept
  voice acting in srw was a mistake
  rei had some character with warming up to shinji and wanting to help fix his relationship with gendo before being eaten by the angel yes i had forgotten about that i dont think that is given any focus on x though and the eaten by the angel thing happens at the same time that the other angel taking over asukas eva and kouji rampaging in zero which made for a cool stage where shinji gets to save everyone but is part of the whole condensing the entire plot to four stages to completely ignore eva after thing that i mentioned earlier
  first anime beating an adaptation of alice in wonderland by a few months first overall show though dont think so
  z was the last time you could swap out boss borot iirc or was it l
  thats often how it works in real life
  was dunbine the first show to ever do that shit  isekai has been a thing in fiction since forever narnia comes to mind but there has to be countless examples before but i dont know what could be the first example in anime
  i mean people admire genghis khan so yes
  unfortunately bosszinger is impractical since kouji and tetsuya dont get any new units in z   its pretty great in w though only downside is mazinger cant resupply
  i had boss in great mazinger and he was doing really well with it
so how many things in t are going to be explained by the dimension pliers
  aside from dunbine and rayearth should be zero
  an ebin srw gr reference      do you anons think we would see heroman again for the next srw after t as banpresto seems to be taking the western countries into account lately it would be a neat homage to stan lee to bring back the one mecha anime he was part of  im under the impression the west is aware of heroman even less than japan does
    im under the impression the west is aware of heroman even less than japan does  yeah i think the same think if anything why would see more big o eva and wing hell i would be glad if that means we get the tv versions again intead of rebuild and endless waltz they may even throw flcl there please not the sequels
tv wing should have been in t
  it seems we have a 1 gundam boyband per entry thing in these post z3 games with celestian being in v wing boys in x and shuffle aliance now
  except v also had seed crew as well    hopefully next game we will have gundam x back
what will be the gimmick of the true final boss in the if/true path    v  25 clones  x  well you know this one  t 
  an actual intellectually stimulating tactical challenge
  that mp great is perfect for boss in mx
  x was in z3 it wont be back anytime soon    probably victory gundam so they can have hd assets to reuse in the future
  i dont see the seed kids as a boy band they are like two separate duos even if they now just have them being best buds with each other cause we are post plot they are other entries with more than one gundam but without the these are all main characters feeling granteed the shuffle aliance arent that important in g either but i would still put them above most nonmc gundams from other entries
  t  the final boss is the entire map itself and you know which fucking planet it will be it can attack any square and its map damages everyone while you can only attack its core at the center of the stage
victory gundam hasnt been in srw since alpha gaiden  d    what did bb studio mean by this
  seed kids are linkin parktier
  its a mystery
  it can attack any square and its map damages everyone while you can only attack its core at the center of the stage  i sure hope that map doesnt have infinite ammo
    this shit needs a long break from srw
  to this day bx and shin are the only srw that did uc without zeta or zz in anyway shape or form    i guess they dont wanna leave the comfort zone but still
  im still mad that sai is a literal and actual cuck
  who was he again flays old boyfriend before she decided kira would better help her get revenge
  yes    flay somehow gets redemption at the end and spiritually talks to kira or something but doesnt even say shit to sai    sai gets a single shot in the epilogue and doesnt even show up in destiny
  you can only attack its core at the center of the stage  better yet it moves to a random square every turn
      oh and to be clear hes flays fiance not just boyfriend    he even gets a scene where he tries to ride the strike and fails terribly but somehow gets no character development after that
  thats one sexy bitch and also ange
  the best
do we know if magic knight rayearth counts as the whole thing or could t only have the first season
  it didnt say chapter 2 on the shown logo
  that means first season only cause im watching it now and the first majin shows up at episode 10 out of 20 so if they start at that point theres only 10 episodes of plot the game can use
  you see season 2 characters in the pv
  having the dx only hardly counts
i just want a srw with less dimension warping   the issue with v was that the worlds everyone else came from had more interesting set ups than what we actually got
  with how they pick series before writing the story now i highly doubt well ever get a game without dimension warping
  v  i hope you meant x because i still would have liked a srw game in the world of revolution
  this one could work with just a main world and isekai world for rayearth and dunbine maybe some time travel to get the dunbine ova guys but i really hope its just one earth
  the sentiment applies to x also   world of revolution would have made for a fun srw
  it goes for both besides the one that was just yamatto and crossbones the other two worlds had some interesting settings that we just glossed over
  you fight the final boss on foot
  ranka
  by that shitty logic votoms and gunbuster should be in srw t either
  i can only assume the license for it is absurdly cheap
everyone what srw would you like to see fully translated in english     i would like ux and w
  alpha 2
  alpha 3 and z1
  64
  gc and d
tomoyo
  they havent used victory at all since d i think its been gone the longest out of any gundam
what combination attacks are there in v akarasu doesnt have them
  rather than no action its more like infinity much like the mazinkaiser movie is just building up constantly to one very long fight scene the plot really is two or three stages long at best the initial invasion kouji getting into the mazinger and then the final battle
  never ever_
    such is the bias in seed only coordie freaks can be alpha male chads oldtypes at best get some spotlight through nepotism or secretly being newtypes/cyber newtypes     otherwise they are shit only good to make the ubermensch look better
  that is correct    stardust memory isnt that far behind last since in alpha 3
sells mp mecha to feddie  enemies of earth for fun  profit    she cant keep getting away with it
  sword ne plus ultra
  the space wolves    for russ and the wolftime vlka fenryka
  defeat final boss  bang
  x  well you know this one  actually i dont
  space combination  uruz strike  double beam magnum  all recycled shit
  the entire z series had zeta but no zz      doesnt need to if a show airs all in one go like rayearth did it doesnt show up as two seasons even if it did air with a gap between them it doesnt always need to think gundam 00 only when the title changes do they care      are you kidding the yamato/crossbone world got no focus at all as a world you are in the same solar system for what 5 episodes and thats it
  anything to suggest sirbine can do an aura road like attack
one of the themes of t is revenge what are the odds one of the og will have a grudge on the villain og from the start
      at least in v you hopped around worlds even if 80 of the interesting things had already happened    x people are warped in from their much more interesting settings to go on wataruquest
  is she the anaheim electronics of og
  yea it seemed to defeat the point of its own message where every pilot worth a shit is a coordinator except cagalli who mysteriously can seed but isnt a coordinator
  srw t for trauma  srw t for tragedy  srw t for terror
  x was in z3 it wont be back  its the exact opposite anon believe me next game will have x and gargantia again
is there a mecha like sirbine but instead its this    gun  gun harder  gun hardest
  thats literally heavyarms anon
  hyaku shiki
  wing zero custom in z3  vulcan  sword  gun  gun harder  gun hardest  gun hardestest
  speaking about it were chamber and al bros in z3
  i know al was used to talk to chamber during the initial standoff with ledo this scene
  being a coordinator is based though
  stop posting jesus
  being able to bang sluts forever without worries due being impotent    i guess it is both a blessing and a curse
  in ux the sangokuden units were pretty much like that cao caos attacks were  sword  sword harder  sword harder still  sword even harder  get an upgrade addon and sword some more  get an upgrade addon and sword dammit sword  get an upgrade addon turn gold and sword hardest
   cagalli   not a coordinator  i thought she was kiras sister
  not only that shes his twin sister    but no shes not a coordinator
  not an expert about mutant freaks but i think coordies are created by tampering with fetuses hence why cagalli who definetively isnt crying can be sister of a mutant freak
  gc  im sorry anon i never meant to get your hopes up and then crush them underfoot i want gc translated too
  nothing even remotely there they still might give it one for some dumb reason though
when will we get a literal neanderthal og
  are you kidding the yamato/crossbone world got no focus at all as a world you are in the same solar system for what 5 episodes and thats it  i mean that that world wasnt so interesting it had the yamatto earth and crossbones in space thats it
  think solid and liquid snake
stuff from z3 that hasnt been reused yet  80s tetsujin  god mars  orguss  gundam x   gundam  dai guard  diebuster  the big o  macross frontier  macross 7  gargantia  aquarion/evol  dancouga nova  a few votoms ovas    if they follow this trend of reusing things from z3 one by one this looks like a bloody roulette as to whether we get a good game or not next time    though i will say im surprised with the push for all these battleship series that they havent at least tried to get some sort of macross to show up with them
  how many times does this need to be reposted srw english sea releases means no macross until jewmony golds license deathgrip expires in 2021    harmony golds license to the super dimension fortress macross the super dimension cavalry southern cross and genesis climber mospeada will expire on march 14 2021
  i was about to ask does that mean they dont have the rights to m7 but then i remembered that even if hg didnt exist its a licensing nightmare with giant costs hence why we didnt get full vocal songs for basara in alpha 3 like terada originally wanted
  im not up to date with hg bullshit but why would their jewery affect nonog macross shows     i thought that they only owned ditribution rights to anything contained in those specific three shows such as the issue with battletech for using similar looking models from those shows in particular
  kek bamco are greedy jews themselves would probably still include macross even if they had to hand over all localization efforts to hg
    it unfortunately affects everything with macross name eventhough it really shouldnt    macross 7 frontier  delta hasnt been released outside of japan anime or products if you didnt notice    hopefully japan will not do bad licensing like this ever again    even ultraman series has licensing issues        both jewmony gold and chaiyo are truly scum
so i was thinking about battleships in t    were gonna get the arcadia and nadesico obviously but what are the likelihood of the others options are nahel argama gulan gulan graon mother vanguard bebop excelion tower and shin getter dragon
  youre getting the ra calium with recycled lines and shin dragon and thats all    being generous mother vanguard may have a chance since we already have sprite and voices for berah and i think we may get a dunbine ship too
    youre getting the ra calium with recycled lines and shin dragon and thats all  i expect those two and the bebop even if it doesnt get any attacks
  faye and jets ships will be attacks for the bebop
  damn that is s rank dickery how come japan is so bad at realizing they were completely fucked by unilateral contracts blatantly forged documents or just plain shady as fuck interpretation of contract terms that have little to no ambiguity
  i expect faye to be her own unit and jets ship has the same issue does it even have weapons
  hg got the rights to macross back in the 80s long before localization was a common practice for tv anime and also long before japan even knew or cared about the potential of the western market to drive sales they were likely pretty naive to hgs type of game back then      jets hammerhead has a harpoon launcher
  thanks i forgot the ra
  fair enough but still nothing short of mind blowing retardedness or very underhanded manipulation of contracts could explain giving a back then literal who company exclusive rights worldwide and for roughly 40 years even
  i also remember the gxs cast having some sort of landship thing like the iron gear but i dont remember much about it
  its more like they just didnt care back then the mindset was probably if we sign this well get some extra money for free who cares what the westerners end up seeing and thats not to mention that stuff like macross was thought of as disposable entertainment in those days too remember how 0079 was going to be just another bargain bin cancelled 70s show with illproportioned chogokins until the movies changed everything
  i dont even remember if it had a name mightve been something generic like hover base i could see it being a supportish ship with josh and wendy if it even shows up
    the hover base was completely unarmed
    we can get three ships from rayearth the nsx was even in the trailer already the dome and the bravada should be in since theyre doing s2 plot though theyll probably all join only near the end
  80s tetsujin    speaking of which discotek strikes again      sos the bebop    were not getting the ra calium though
well i just finished bebop kinda surprised how underdeveloped the plot and characters were given how popular the show is over here    have any of the previous crossover games it has been in filled in some of the blanks
  the nsx was even in the trailer already    even comes with its own version of a tronium buster cannon on the bow which i fully expect to end up being used in an onmap cinematic or two
  discotek strikes again  fill me in
  i thought ted turner had the rights to ultraman and ultraseven in the us
      theres a couple of other things they bagged but this is relevant to srw
    hes a big guy
  this shit always cracks me up
l had a pretty fun roster looking back
  i was as excited for iczer back then as i am for rayearth now i wonder if itll ever come back
  maybe if iczer gets some new toys or a netflix show
  someday im sure anon
  the story wasnt half bad either boring og stuff aside it had easily the best seed destiny adaptation in the series better than z id say as well as fun stuff like the voltes team practically being part of the macross frontier cast and the operation meteor boys becoming part of different groups each with special mention of wufei becoming a linebarrels of iron character
zuul is justice
  thats nice wufei
  l is a wonderful game aside from the linebarrels finale which always has me tearing my hair out
  manlets when will they learn
  style    over    substance
  well i just finished bebop kinda surprised how underdeveloped the plot and characters were given how popular the show is over here  thats exactly why it was popular over here remember that until recently the average american was allergic to shows having actual plot and only watched episodic stuff like sitcoms cop dramas or medical shows
this line cornfirms this is a postsrwa scenario
  kira got the recessive genes and cagalli the dominant
  l also did the shinji makes friends before getting in the eva thing better than v in my opinion the part where glasses dude from linebarrel pulls some strings to get kouichi quatre and ichitaka into nerv so they can be with shinji in the aftermath of his first angel battle was super sweet
  i think the whole point was lets shown everyone that humans and coordinators can coexist by making one of the twins jesus and the other a normie but i may be mixing that up with another show
would you agree with this assertion  tomino was a far better world builder than storyteller  
i think theres a valid discussion here but off the top of my head id say yes i think hes very similar to george lucas in that hes a true visionary every gundam series hes had a direct hand in has had an indelible quality to it that typically isnt found in other works its nearly impossible to mistake a tomino anime for anything else for better or worse     0079 zeta and chars counterattack are all beloved for a reason but im not so sure the writing itself was a part of that as much as the overall scope of the universal century    on the other hand everything from the set pieces world politics and scenario writing are all as far as im concerned top shelf in a lot of his work    of course this isnt to say i think hes phenomenal every single time he goes to make an anime youll never hear a defense of brain powerd or garzeys wing from me as an example
  brain powerd  ive been holding this off for a long time
  unironically fpbp    youve summed up how i feel about tomino to a t for tomino
  tomino is the george lucas of mecha hm somehow makes sense
    of course i still fascinated by the world of xabungle  lgaim
  no
  he did weird shit in stories but at the end of the day it was more about people coming together than feat of a single person to imply some vague idealism about potential of mankind
  watch for the music    aside from lucas signing for toy rights and tomino despising the merchendising aspect among other things
  tomino is very hit and miss with me as far as his actual stories go but yeah all of his worlds interest me from a conceptual standpoint     there isnt any part of the dunbine franchise that i would call good but id still be jumping to watch any new dunbine work simply because the setting has a lot of potential for interesting things to happen
  where does this meme come form  a bunch of brainlets who cant comprehend his storytelling and are trying to come up with an excuse for why he is relevant
  he is pretty god tiered at everything but pacing honestly      it was the best mecha tv anime of the 90s
  why pacing
  you might be right in the sense that hes more consistently good at crafting settings but the central gundam story from msg through cca is interesting to me because of the characters in it and how they interact his other work is more hit and miss but its his thematic ideas that resonate with me more than the settings
  how do you know he doesnt actually think his storytelling is good already and his worldbuilding is just even better
  because most of the time they say stuff like well his real strength is worldbuilding not storytelling or his storytelling might suck but his worldbuilding is cool you can see that sort of attitude in this very thread
  because some of his shows spend way too much time in the middle in a very repetitive format where tomino just works on establishing the world and characters and the plot meanders too much lgaim or he tries to jam too many ideas in one show and has to rush through them too fast g reco the only other director in his league is oshii as far a as i am concerned but no one is perfect
  absolute opposite    he gives zero shit about worldbuilding and actively undermines it at times see g reco takes place after turn a but does decent stories
  well there is that but yeah both seems to do better with creating interesting settings worlds and other shit but story wise and some characters they range from decent/good to holy shit this is dumb
wasnt there another medieval fantasy mech show tomino did that wasnt dunbine name escapes me
  wings of rean
  no the robots were big and clunky looking one was red had a sword it had an 80s art style that reminded me of gundam
  are you sure youre not thinking of panzer world galient
    sounds like panzer world galient but that wasnt tomino
  hes bad at dialogue apparently although im not sure whats so strange about tominospeak as opposed to just normal talk i know its weird though
  remember hes just a human humans are just human
    tomino struggles with making sense of convoluted situations it could be because hes so easygoing though     the 12th and 13th century foreigners surrounding him not so much but thats what the dementia medication is for
  i think a lot of it is that tomino writes many characters as selfish irrational assholes which makes sense if you interact with people but not if your idea of human interaction is picking the best ending right choice in the jrpg dialog tree
  far better world builder than storyteller  oh yes so it is with so many successful franchises especially scifi
  world building is an aspect of storytelling you tard
  not necessarily    you can craft a beautiful wonderfully complex world for your characters to inhabit and still be unable to write a good story about it or its characters    star wars prequels being a great example
  hideaki anno  tomino
  lol
  which makes sense if you interact with people  thing about tomino characters is that none of them can hide how theyre selfish irrational assholes unlike in real life a good deal of tomino shows are just people screaming at each other autistically
  given peoples reactions to cca on /m/ it seems like char did an even better job tricking us than the cast in zeta i think the point of what he is doing though is that under stressfull situations like in all his shows peoples inner demons come out more explicitly you get the usual deflection and hiden motivation during down time but when you are in the middle of some brutal war of attrition the real you comes out more because you dont have the energy to put up those barriers
  anno would disagree
  nah tomino characters are like that in every situation xabungle is the best example the crew of the iron gear arent at war for most of the show and their conflict is relatively relaxed but theyre probably the loudest cast that tomino ever wrote
gundam unicorn can turn time backwards it is just the key    what is really important is a fucking plate with some text on it    wow
we belong to earth
  what is really important is a fucking plate with some text on it    apparently ef was an orwellian state on its inception as the record of its original charter was that easy to get lost  in fucking computer age
  no its more that once the original charter was lost the feds took the opportunity to scrap all of the copies and then create another charter original and accompanying copies
  what pisses me off is that how axis shock was implied to be miracle of collective human heart being made equal to some fag doing kira yamato with newtype hacks as some sort of potential of possibilities when its super coordinater shit all over again  fucking snow flake millennials
  are you telling me that original charter was just a plaque  lol this is not how it works if your space pm is about to unveil a charter that is already finalized by the constituent assembly that has decided how rule will be in new world government it is already in records nice loophole in lore when anyone can come up with any bullshit regarding first 6 decades of federation
muh monument
  and it becomes more stupid when you see through this   the feds took the opportunity to scrap all of the copies and then create another charter original and accompanying copies    why go through all this sing and dance when you can come up with charter that does not put any if that shit about some vague shit about mutated man living in space in first place   but hey who cares proceedings of a constituent assembly does not make a robot show especially something that happened 79 years before the juicy part  oyw  but who knew that fukui will mix this federation with verhovens federation that is fighting bugs
  
  im fucking sorry but that is literally how the shitshow is explained in unicorn no shit it doesnt work in real life part of the laplace box wasnt just the existence of the original charter plaque but that they had a shitton of constant footage of the creation of the original plaque from multiple angles and the people arriving in person to sign the plaque i am not making this bullshit up it is literally in the ova
  unicorn was a big mistake
the promo synopsis for nt literally has  one year later in uc0097 the world is still largely unchanged
  they had a shitton of constant footage of the creation of the original plaque  that is pretty fucking stupid but they surely couldve doctored the footage to remove the last line on the plaque
    miiiiiiiiiiiight be cool im not sure i dig how they dont seem to be giants
  3d  gross  ill just keep reading the manga
  to be fair it looks like actual good 3d not the shit a lot of studios have been going with
  the model quality looks fine and they seem to be doing mocap for most of the animation like infinit force which should at least keep it consistent but the arbitrary choppiness makes it look awful
  i wonder if zero would show up in this considering he is basically his cousin
every time i turn around theres a new ultra series being promoted where the fuck do you even start these days
  japan wants their own ironman seeing how theyve moved beyond spandex looking heroes
    this was an okay first impression hopefully the pedigree of the source material and directors/studio wasnt misplaced in the whole product ill agree that it was very jarring when it got choppier but it looks like it wont happen too much just remember dont be as salty as pic related
hayata sounds nothing like susumu kurobe and its distracting
  start in the 60s
  lucky star avatar  are you even surprised anon
  look at this dude who doesnt like something  haha what a faggot having actual opinions and shit instead of mindlessly consuming anything branded with something he likes
  why the fuck did you black out the name when his actual account name is right there
  i dont know how comfortable hed be with voice acting besides hes pretty old    gridman has highschool/slice of life elements  that explains everything
  hes a retard
    having negative opinions is bad you should like everything because people put their hearts and souls into making it sobs    is this what they mean by advertiser friendly yikes
  that i am looking back the blackedout name wasnt even his real name so yeah i fucked up
  ultraman is powerarmor in this series and not a giant sentient being  what the shit
   negative opinions is bad  the first one you youd is actually making the opposite point but w/e
   meant for     my point still stands
  huh they skipped bemulars first design im not even sure why they changed bemulars design in the manga in the first place
  that use of old sound effects  especially in the transformation
  make it 60fps and it would be perfect    ive been meaning to check out this new ultraman thing it looks good guess its about time i did then
  yeah that is my biggest problem with it the visuals look fine n the trailer but looked real choppy
  i think this not really a final product  like pic related scene when he using the specium kousen some scene looks really smooth and some still looks choppy    i just cant judge the quality from a little teaser trailer like this maybe 1 or 2 next trailer will do for me nonetheless im glad that the cgi actually looks good unlike that re009 movie as expected from sola digital works studio
  i hope thats just a trailer problem and the show would actually have a better framerate than this when its released
  i remember this being teased like a year ago so this may not quite be the final product but theyre getting there and yeah i did notice that some shots were smoother namely the nonaction ones  and yeah the cgis actually pretty damn good thats what caught my eye
  the cg fails to capture the stylish look of the manga it looks extremely bland
  we want the mcu iron man audience
  they using a motion capture in this
  i want to be hyped but    netflix
  that still doesnt give them the excuse of having such bland art direction
  really does that mean we have to put up with that awkward uncannyvalley rotoscopey style of movement
    ultraman goes inside a giant ultraman like hulkbuster
  uncannyvalley  thats a stretch it just looks like a video game cutscene
  i mean like mcu iron man actually looks more and more toku as they went on with him
  from the trailer its hard to get a handle on how its actually going to look because of how fast the editing is but something about its reminding me of mgs4
april 1  out season april joke
    looks neat    black borders on the subtitles though please
  show us the name anon
  they got zoffys actor for him
  god hopefully this doesnt go full berserk 2016
  any wanna 3d animetion company should watch gravity rush once to avoid a berserk
  its an adaptation of the 2011 manga from the linebarrel/getter devolution guys its a sequel to the original series set forty or so years after basically it turns out that after the og ultraman left and flew off into space at the end of the original series left behind a bit of his essence dubbed as the ultraman factor in his host shin hayata which gives him superpowers which he also passes onto his son teenage shinjiro the mangas main character the power armors are basically created by the sssp now operating in secret as a way for them to channel their powers into fighting hostile aliens attacking earth there are also reimagined versions of the classic ultramen and monsters in the series
  any wanna 3d animetion company should watch berserk 2016 to avoid a berserk 2016    ftfy gravity rush is pretty cool tho
  they love iron man so yeah
  japan fucking loves the mcu in general
  whats the source on the webmbesides simply gravity rush
they are definitely getting there  
  first tweet he mentions that the manga is boring and he doesnt like  last shows that he just found out that the ultraman in the manga isnt giant  so he didnt read the manga if youre just say that you dont like own it just dont lie about it reading something when you cleary didnt
  when will you faggots fucking learn that if i wanted to know what some retards opinion on twitter was id go on fucking twitter
  4chan doesnt revolve around you aspie
  twitter screencaps are pure cancer stop fucking posting them before i fuck you up the ass and make you humble faggot
  wasnt even the fag that posted it but just because youre so buttflustered
  is this pretend autism or real autism
  the gravity rush anime should be officially available on sonys youtube
  the suit up scene definitely take cues from taros regeneration after using ultra dynamite
  new kamen rider anime trailer look mighty fine
  you mean metal heroes right
    dont you mean garo
considering how shit linebarrels was im not getting my hopes up
  dont you mean ronin warriors
  off topic a bit heres hoping the blu ray gets released in the states
  to be fair iron man is the best mcu character
  personally im more a fan of mcu hank pym and his curmudgeon approach to being responsible with superscience stark has been a series of fuckups aimed at atoning for each previous fuckup and theres a point where it gets a bit rote
its tokusatsu  burgers are gonna hate it  but its netflix  burgers are gonna love it  but its with japanese power rangers  burgers are gonna hate it  but they turned ultraman into ironman  burgers are gonna love it    i dont know if this is gonna flop or not /m/ im conflicted in the outcome
   tokusatsu  its not its anime
  tokusatsu aesthetics    dont be that guy
  well they already screwed up the specium ray
  some ultraman on crunchyroll  some ultraman on amazon primes toku thing  now some ultraman on netflix  kind of a mess
  batman the animated series is such an amazing live action cartoon guys
  although i must admit its nice to have access to it in the west at all
  i mean its a step up from a couple years ago which was no ultraman besides some shitty mill creek dvd sets  i do get the feeling that the streaming bubble is going to pop in a few years though what with literally every big company trying to do their own streaming service
no giants  gross cg animation  basically just iron man    hard pass
  i dont know friend this looks more like studio polygon style work comparing this and the currently airing gridmans cg is kind of worrying
  shitty mill creek dvd sets
  good old mill creek quality control though to be fair they did fix this in later printings    speaking of which now that chaiyos fucked off whose dick do i have to suck to get those original ultraman bds localized
i cannot stress how disappointed i am that they went with anime voice actors instead of getting ultraman actors         japanese studio  western writers    oh boy i cant wait to see how my fellow burgers write andromeda shun im sure they wont use him as a mouthpiece to promote any agendas no siree
    that was because marvel wanted to localize sun vulcan in the 80s gavan and metal heroes could pass off as iron man suits if you do some adjustments in design
heathcliff its me im cathy  ive come home im so cold  let me in through your window  heathcliff its me im cathy  ive come home im so cold  let me in through your window  heathcliff its me im cathy  ive come home im so cold

  best shrike girl
  kate is great  her death hit me hardest
    i really thought the last one was going to make it
  agreed she couldnt move or the shuttle wouldnt have made it and that dude doesnt even try to blow up her suit just kills her inside it
    was that supposed to be noble or something because while it sure was swell for him not to destroy the rocket it still seems especially cruel to execute someone that defenseless
  noble from her but very cruel from him indeed    she was a great character and apart from her death i enjoyed everything about her her compassion her dedication her design she was pretty hot she definitely stood out from the other girls in her team and id even consider her bestgirl of the series as a whole
  same connie was my favorite shrike too
heathcliff  fixed

3 the word of the lord came expressly unto ezekiel the priest the son of buzi in the land of the chaldeans by the river chebar and the hand of the lord was there upon him    4 and i looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the north a great cloud and a fire infolding itself and a brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber out of the midst of the fire    5 also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man    6 and every one had four faces and every one had four wings    7 and their feet were straight feet and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calfs foot and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass    8 and they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides and they four had their faces and their wings    9 their wings were joined one to another they turned not when they went they went every one straight forward    10 as for the likeness of their faces they four had the face of a man and the face of a lion on the right side and they four had the face of an ox on the left side they four also had the face of an eagle    11 thus were their faces and their wings were stretched upward two wings of every one were joined one to another and two covered their bodies    12 and they went every one straight forward whither the spirit was to go they went and they turned not when they went    13 as for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance was like burning coals of fire and like the appearance of lamps it went up and down among the living creatures and the fire was bright and out of the fire went forth lightning    14 and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning    15 now as i beheld the living creatures behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures with his four faces
  16 the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl and they four had one likeness and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel    17 when they went they went upon their four sides and they turned not when they went    18 as for their rings they were so high that they were dreadful and their rings were full of eyes round about them four    19 and when the living creatures went the wheels went by them and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up    20 whithersoever the spirit was to go they went thither was their spirit to go and the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels    21 when those went these went and when those stood these stood and when those were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels    22 and the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal stretched forth over their heads above    23 and under the firmament were their wings straight the one toward the other every one had two which covered on this side and every one had two which covered on that side their bodies
  best girl from raideen was a nun before she was a pilot does that count
  24 and when they went i heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters as the voice of the almighty the voice of speech as the noise of an host when they stood they let down their wings    25 and there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads when they stood and had let down their wings    26 and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it    27 and i saw as the colour of amber as the appearance of fire round about within it from the appearance of his loins even upward and from the appearance of his loins even downward i saw as it were the appearance of fire and it had brightness round about    28 as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain so was the appearance of the brightness round about this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the lord and when i saw it i fell upon my face and i heard a voice of one that spake

  the entire operation yashima sequence in rebuild is top 5 action scenes in mech anime imo
  i know were supposed to hate the crusades and christians now but christian and crusade motifs and imagery are fucking rad gotta genocide all those heathens while cloaked in white bearing the banner of the church and presenting gold crosses its the only way to kill people in style
  someone post the nazi angel mecha from gold lightan
  ultraman
  shitoranger
  you mean to tell me that japanese church gets live toku performances in the name of god
  thats the only one ive found so far but i wouldnt be shocked to find out about more churches with their own local heroes
  someone post the italian super robot comic
  well if this is true then japanese christians are my favorite christian subgroup ever    if any of the churches i went to as a kid had stuff like this i probably wouldnt have hated going as much
  hrm recommended videos doesnt give any obvious leads  i wonder if feeding the katakana for local hero and maybe kanji for religious or however they write christianity or something might give some leads
  id say its worth a shot and what about the channel that the video was posted on maybe something there too if you find anything else let us know
  well i didnt expect that
  yeah im pretty sure theyve posted more than just that one show i think thats just the christmas special i had put aside for future reference
  they have videos going back eight years most of which seem to be recordings of normal worship days they have a lot of live band stuff on there too but its entirely possible that the toku show was a one off which would disappoint me greatly
    if you google 伝道戦隊シトレンジャー theres some that come up  google will try to correct it to 電動戦隊シモレンジャー but its wrong
  at least this wasnt a one time thing im glad to see that
  man id go to church every week if it was actually like this
  i know were supposed to hate the crusades and christians now   says who
  i mean technically
  10 as for the likeness of their faces they four had the face of a man and the face of a lion on the right side and they four had the face of an ox on the left side they four also had the face of an eagle    god has combiners

  pretty sure tezuka converted at some point
  pretty sure tezuka converted at some point  nope according to frederik schodt   his family was associated with a zen buddhist sect and tezuka is buried in a tokyo buddhist cemetery but his views on religion were actually quite agnostic and as flexible as his views on politics
  ah neat
  was there ever a ya know good episode of bibleman
  american evangelicals are incapable of making anything entertaining

  the worst thing to piot in all of gundam
  
  explain this
    always see this dumb thing in gihren no yabou shin  see it in the end screen of federation victory  never bothered to look up what it is  the publicclass is basically a simple space vehicle such as a shuttle that was crudely refitted to include room for a pair of capital shipgrade torpedoes to be used in hitandrun attacks
  an improvised torpedo boat derived from a shuttle mass produced in the early oyw mostly out of desperation
i watched 2001 a space odyssey for the first time and think tomino may have been inspired
       the publicclass was useful during the battle of solomon when these ships deployed beam dispersion smoke allowing some of the federations dedicated fighting vessels to close in on the space fortress     the publicclass was also utilized during the battle of a baoa qu although they were far less successful in their ploy to use the beam disruption smoke    basically remember that scene in unicorn where the general revil shoots some missiles they explode into gas and suddenly sinanjus beams are hitting a brick wall for a bit these guys were shooting that back in 79
  i love how we had beam diffusing chaff in 0079 but it just vanishes from canon until fucking unicorn    youd think something like that would be used more often

what playing the game feels like
  i looked into their twitter lots of complaints    game should renamed to neet operation 2    bd1 ifrit kai  proto should be 400 cost not 350
  agreed on those 3 costing 400 but i feel like neets arent a huge issue outside of going for gold in this ranked match
are bazookas actually that bad or are people just overreacting about every fucking thing  played the first one never had problems played a bit of 2 before my isp decided to explode and didnt have problems
  thats the thing dude theyre too good theyre meta you stun and damage your opponent then fuck em up with melee nothing beats this bazookamelee combo in terms of sheer damage and simplicity
  theres also the ranking match isnt showing strength of the player but who is the top ranking neet    since everyones playing ranking matches rating matches are empty    one commented that hopefully is will be the last ranking because its a disappointment
  sad when just using a machine gun is a refreshing change of pace from normal gameplay    opinions on lv5 ground gm smallboy in bigboi meta or does he have a chance as a dedicated machine gunner
  i have the level 4 havent gotten the 5 yet but it is a genuinely good ms it has more health than the gm command in the same cost room dodge roll balancers i think and shock absorbers so its pretty good with some sheild reinforcement leg armor extra health and melee program as well as the bazooka equiped it will be a reliable machine
  it like the powered gm only has one melee swing and a higher shooting stat so its not as well suited to splash and slash meta hes also still very slow movement wise if only he could use the beam rifle then he would bring something unique to the meta
    played the shit out of the first one  youre saying the meta is basically identical to what it was at the end of bo1
  more or less id really like the wr type hopefully it comes out this week like  said its better on shooting isntt very speedy and only has 1 melee swing and the meta probably has shifted a little seeing how ms with hybrid specialty seem to be played effectively the most zudah with asr is effective against supports at range gm command and ez8 dominate raid/assault types etc
  id say the current meta is reds that can splash and slash like a blue blues that do it better while having good leg health and yellows that can stun through maneuver armor or deal massive limb damage
  theres nothing wrong with bazookas theyre how you play the fucking game this game would be boring if everyone was running around with mgs  you can play the game without bazookas too just look at suits like gm la zaku 2 s gm cold district type gundam with napalm  using a bazooka is solid but beams are really damaging and rewarding if you land them and luckily gm las beam gun has autoaim on it mgs with high rate of fire are good but make you play somewhat of a support roll with you only being on the frontline when you have your attachment grenade ready chipping away peoples health and finishing people off with the mg and/or grenades can save lives its just recommended to only have 1 general unit with an mg if the rest have bazooka  shield
  dont forget zaku cannon destroys blues as long as you dont let them get too close  and with a full machine gun clip if a teammate knocks down an enemy you can leg them before they get up
is anyone else having trouble logging in my connection is fine but for some dumb reason or another it keeps erroring upon getting my entitlement information
  having the same issue youre not alone
  psn was down for maintenance earlier its back up now
100k damage in space with a raid if only it wasnt proto then it would be cool
be me  love the rx78  suck balls at using it  play a space match  team getting its ass kicked  suddenly switch flips in my brain  rack up the next four or five kills that puts our team leagues ahead  win    diddid i become a newtype
  youre beginning your awakening as one anon show us the strength of the human heart
gm sniper ii with parts giving it 52 in ranged  your torment begins bluetrash
  when you run out of bullets with the sniper 2 and are stuck with those slow rate of fire grenades
    running out of bullets  my dudes the bullpup reloads super fast take that lv5 bullpup into an unrestricted and watch the gps melt the grenades are strong too almost 2k to gps
  i know the bullpup is good i use it a lot but as a whole yellows are better for their support role heavy staggers help a team more especially since with a bullpup youre in efreet kai/proto range plus with database link its like 3 shots to cripple less if your team follows up on that stagger    ill fight a g3 with a bullpup in my sniper 2 though because g3 is ass compared to other reds
  i disagree with most everything you typed the sniper rifle doesnt heavy stagger yellows work better the closer they are to their blues and the closer they are to their blues the more likely they are to get help with enemy reds sit back on a hill or roof top and youre isolated you can use support weapons at close range and g3 is one of the better reds but because of its cost you wont see it a whole lot
  im in the same boat thats why i asked keep reading people going about how broken bazookas are and how unplayble the game is because of that and i find that incredible silly the first one was like that and that never stopped a lv7 gm light armor slashing people like butter
doing my dailies on the ps4 while the football games on the radio so i can have both my teams losing at once  yep niiice and comfy
meta team vs not meta were we doomed from the start how did a ground gm with mg get high damage over the ezmeta
  image would help
  majority ez8s and gm commands are shit theyre good suits but most players are bad so a good suit with a bad player still has a bad player    there are people who dont know some suits can swing multiple times
im convinced zaku tanks and the people that use them are retarded
    gm light armor slashing     god what was that gm they added later on that was took this shit to a whole new level night something fuck that thing fucking pricks would load up on armor mods then laugh in your face when they tanked your shots like nothing
  gm night seeker the one you can target with artillery strike and mark your enemy by hitting them with your beam saber
why cant the ground gm use a ground type beam rifle
why were the colony drops on australia and ireland so different in scale and impact
    speaking from a production standpoint its possibly because one was only included as a vague reference with no detail that was later filled out by other writers while the second was an onscreen event that the cast had to interact with and so was limited in its scope to ensure that they could be nearby and not die    additionally since the writers who created the details for the one year war drop decided to say it was only one cylinder the narrator for 0079 leaves it ambiguous then they had to attribute a lot more damage to that one drop than is really nessecary    in universe the angle and speed of entry were probably different and so resulted in different degrees of damage or something
one was a hard drop the other was a gentle drop
    a hard fedexit and a soft fedexit was gatos the no deal fedexit
how many drops took place during uc im counting three colonies plus one asteroid    0079  one week war obliterates australia plus chunks of north america and eurasia  0083  operation stardust ecological damage to north america  0089  second neo zeon war destroys dublin  0093  chars rebellion fifth luna asteroid destroys lhasa    and yeah both the first colony drop has been retroactively treated as a colossal planetarywide catastrophe see picture while the other three as pretty much a largerthanaverage inconvenience especially the dublin one
  haman dropped a really small one i guess
  the original proposals for gundam had there be dozens of colony drops that explains why the single drop did so much damage in the final version its a relic from an earlier version of the script
  seems drunk right here so she probably did and didnt notice
  seems drunk right here  not yet she doesnt    now she does
  plot armor if the ireland drop hit as hard as sydney all the main characters of zz would have been killed and we could have had a good series
  this what happens when you new type too hard
  you mean this old thing    most of the colonies of sides 2 and 5 are crashed onto the earth and 35 billion people are killed    i think the issue is not making the first colony drop utterly devastating but having the subsequent ones become almost routine
          so xs map is the original and most accurate
  yes looks like one landed smack dab in the caspian and aral
    so america got fucked in both nebraska and missourihilarious
        i think the current plot line is    operation british was a direct high velocity drop meant to totally wipe out jaburo completely above and underground instead it missed and put a pretty crater in australia sent the earth into a low end nuclear winter and fucked up coastal cities across the globe that was after half of the colony broke up in the atmosphere with bits raining down on north america even    stardust was intentionally sabotaged so that it would only ruin the north american mass granary    lets not forget a thermonuclear device was set off in jaburo during zeta which probably kicked a load of dust into the atmosphere    dublin drop was slowed down and only meant to destroy dublin as a neo zeon show of power iirc somewhere in zz i think they mention the earths climate is so weak at this point that theres artificial jungles set up in europe because the real jungles are almost extinct    fifth luna was meant for a specific target the federation assembly in lhasa
  broke up in the atmosphere  fidf please leave  they knew it was aimed at jaburo and shot it into pieces to save themselves
      i think they both did
  and cali florida pananma got widened too persian gulf got bigger too
    in short earth gets smacked by now less than 56 60what would you say a whole oneill yield would be 200 gt impacts    why isnt the planet in a ice age for at least a century
because zz couldnt decide what kind of tone it wanted to have
  not sure but honestly i think if all those colonies broke up and scattered the damage would cover like half the earth imagine it literally raining cenks of metal and glass dozens of meters wide going a few hundred mph
    at least it fares better than the fucking joke that was aldnoah zero
    or the upcoming mortal engines
  those fucked up americas  and nothing of value was lost
  the fuck happened with australia there looks like it ate sea
   was intentionally sabotaged so that it would only ruin the north american mass granary  no the delaz fleet meant to do that to force the earth to lean on the colonies more for food so that spacenoids rise up
  were the colonies different sizes
  what is that from
  it probably is
  
  if the grey is whats left then yay i live and all the retards die
  i thought it was also a proof of concept for future spacenoids that colony drops were operationally possible even with minimal resources  which is the inspiration for the dublin and axis drops
  theres a drop that failed in zeta we see the remains on the moon
  one exploded on impact when it dropped while the other one just impacted the city but didnt explode
dragon ball is /m/    
with capsule corp dr wheelo and stuff yeah its pretty /m/ just dont be a dick about it
screen writer yamamoto yu passed away on nov 25  rip jinraiger    
ah fuck    though jinraiger was never going to happen anyway and we all knew it
  damn that sucks though yeah as   said jiniraiger seemed to have been abandoned anyways still its a shame to hear of a screenwriters death
  if he was serious he couldve left some notes on overall plot
  youd be surprised how much material there was about the show posted on the monthly updates on their site theyve posted notes as well as script excerpts from all the 50 episodes that were planned on paper over the years before production startedthe overall writing was finished enough for the earlier episodes that a web manga was being published on niconico behind a paywall  speaking of which im actually curious what happened with it anyways behind the scenes its been almost three years since production was officially announced with a studio chosen by the production committee and over two years since the announcement they were close to announcing the series staff / the announcement a couple months later that there were unexpected issues with production unfortunately that sort of thing is never going to be written about in depth much less translated in english
if arche gundam had transam he would wipe celestial being maybe only not setsuna  prove me wrong
    hed probably kill one or two meisters but transam is just too short burst to kill 3 or 4 meisters and destroy the ptolemaios in my opinion plus after one use setsuna would be on guard against him specifically next time he appeared and lock him down to prevent ali from doing much more damage
  how big is that arche gundam also it has one of the most interesting head designs in all gundams
  hes about 20m
  also the robot damashii is way better than the hg
  yeah but who can afford those
  doesnt that apply to damn near all of them the pricey action figure should always beat the out of box high grade
  judging by those pak50s it looks around a kilometer
  they are toys after all they can take more of the stress of being played with than gunpla
is it any good effectswise i liked the original when i saw it years ago  id ask /tv/ but theyll just make jokes about feces
  i thought designated was a /pol/ meme
  its /int/ but thats beside the point  the first movie is a relatively deep cut where /m/ is concerned even though it was on nf for a bit i liked it a lot when it was new and im not even a drav
  all bollywood movies are irredeemable garbage without exception and that includes robot     /tv/ told you as much but you just cant accept reality
  dont care its /m/ and i still want to see it  just wish someone else here had too so id know how high or low to set my expectations
  go for low actually go for the lowest you can
  all bollywood movies are irredeemable garbage without exception and that includes robot    here comes the faggot who is talking out of ass  endhiran is not bollywood movie lol bollywood only represents the hindi language movies and endhirna is a tamil movie originally secondly watch actually good indian movies than what that nri down the lane showed you before acting like an idiot who has no idea about a vast movie scene outside hollywood and repeats whatever similar arm chair tell about it      its an okay sequel not good but not very bad either special effects are good by our standards 
i still want to see rocket tarzan    trip to moon sorta related  
   is it any good effectswise  if in this day effectwise should be ok as long it was in the lowest mode of expectation  back in my childhood where free cable tv was part of my life hindi  bollywood movie does a very low budget when come into stunt a total low blow budget stunt   watch a protag jump from tower to tower with a bike stunt move   turn to cutscene of a personrideonbikestraightcutoutofmagazine swiveling on top of the 2 tower from end to end signify the success bike jump   car drive into a open trailer in motion   turn to cutscene of a remote car / toy car move into an open static card box    theres endless of those to be told actually  that happened like 25 years ago  shits just cracks me up in laughter when i remember those low blow budget moves
will it ever be topped so far the best /m/echa ever made wish it had been 50 episodes instead
it would have been forgotten already if it didnt make for such potent shitposting fuel
  just finished this the other day  i unironically liked it i like when people shit on things so i go in with low expectations   few quick left turns that dont make any fucking sense that im sure were memeable but ive sat thru mecha with worse moe shit and it wasnt part of the brand
  it was so bad it was hilarious seeing everyone lose their minds near the end the shitposting was fun thats for sure
  youre trying too hard kid nobody here will think youre cool
  i still rewatch eps 115 watched through it all back in september  now im sitting here regretting the fact that i wasnt around to witness the diarrhea hurricane that this show caused
  wish it had never existed
dropped at episode 16 out of boredom  did it get entertaining at least near the end
dropped at the episode where they tried to discuss their sexuality and was trying to figure out how to breed    i just cant stand it anymore expected it to be more into weird mystery shit but ended up being like a highschool drama
  episodes 20 and 21 were actually not bad despite the fact that the show was on its way to tanking  in one of those they do actually acknowledge just how absurd the new developments in the story are but after these two things just go completely off the rails
wish it had been 50 episodes instead  more like  wish it had been 10 plot episodes and 40 filler episodes instead
burning heart  a hand drawn animation  literally top gun with mechs  best white base variant  anavel gato  cima double triple criss cross into i accidentally a war crime  all those excellent side character feddie pilots  i have returned  this fucker as the upgrade      gundam 0083 is the most underrated show in the franchise
  yeah i think youre right
  also its only 12 13 episodes so no filler like you see in all of the 50 episode series
  anyone who complains about nina is a cuck
  100 most of the ppl on this board are terrified by the idea of being with a woman that isnt a perfect virgin whos been waiting for them their entire lives but its just because theyre afraid of having their performance compared to other men
i have returned  i would almost say its my favorite gundam but war in the pocket edges it out
    im fine for a lady to not be a pure and perfect virgin and all that jazz cima is cool as fuck after all but for fucks sakes she let gato drop the bloody colony and caused millions to suffer
  its been awhile since i watched stardust but i dont think she let gato drop the colony she got gundamd
  she let gato drop the bloody colony  iirc she didnt
  you forgot to mention that the starting gundams are 2 of the best mc mechs in all of gundam     probably second only to the sazabi/nu in cca
    fuck im probably remembering wrong she definitely had him at gunpoint while he was fiddling with the coordinates or something right
  oops forgot to include the pic
  you forgot the harmeshit tier writing and cringe moments
  why because the mc isnt a super chad ace newtype those moments didnt bother me
  youre thinking of nina
  he was talking about nina he just referenced cima to say that wahmen dont have to be pure innocent virgins
  thats who i meant in  but im a dyslexic idiot and i really worded that post wrong
    oh my bad then
ill hop on this bandwagon ive always taken the fact that /m/ hates 0083 so much to be a sign that its truly a great show
  those tickets really need a mg 20
  not to mention best gp unit
  gerbera tetra is a gp unit meaning its in the same line as zephrantis physalis and dendrobium    i had no idea
  what was to be the gp04 got sold off to cima some mods and paint later and you get the gerbera tetra that we all know and love  re/100 when
  yeah 0083 is surprisingly underrated on /m/ then again i mostly chalk it up to braindead morons who also post on /pol/
  re/100 of the gerbera not the tetra is already available
  underrated  its not we just a very vocal retarded minority that likes to shit on it because they dont like mecha
  you mean they dont like shitty anime writing that takes up 90 of the runtime
  i dont think anyone will disagree that 0083 has a lot of cool shit it just also has a lot of really really dumb shit
  i would say 0083 has a better cool shit per episode ratio than 95 of anime    and it has roughly the same dumb shit per episode ratio as an average anime
the arguments of op only shows us that the best way to approach 0083 is by watching some amv with the scenes everything else is terrible
honestly its pretty silly to see people be so enraged by a plot twist to the point of hating the entire ova gundam 0083 is gundam kino its almost everything military mecha otaku and action fans love   no newtypes  politically charged plotline with secret operations military crimes corrupt leaders and  fraudulent court martials  strictly military vibe no kids allowed  pilots are hardass commanders old soldiers with scarred lives and young enlisted aces mixed in with cute female officers and mechanics   villains are tortured exsoldiers dreaming of glory and power hungry opportunists with lives torn by war  combine that with  gorgeous animation  top tier mechanical details  uniform porn  zeon fanwank  peak 1980s aesthetics with a jammin soundtrack  and gundam 003 is about as close as you can get to an objectively excellent anime its simply one of the greatest mecha anime ever that caters to both hardcore gundam fans and anime casuals
i dunno where i stand on 0083 it has some good characters the animation is nice designs are great sounds lovely and it all looks great     but jesus christ on the cross do i hate nina not even for the cuck meme shit but just for the fact shes such a catalyst for annoyance kou is fine on his own hell hes kinda endearing as a thundering dumbass but the moment the ol wench gets on scene i swear    id have enjoyed it more with just more time with the zeeks and less time on the thot
keith should have been the main character
  its almost everything military mecha otaku and action fans love  holy fuck thank you we are on a mecha board thats the stuff we should be excited about
    dont tell me what i should and shouldnt like you dont speak for me
  i find amazing that people point that nina shenanigans is the bad part when it is everything else monsha kou gato every single one of them is fucking terrible    with newtypes at least we have a reason to have a retarded main character unlike 0083 where he is normal as fuck and even dumber    i hated 0083 from the first episode before anything else that came after i just wanted to end it already and the best moment was the end when i will never watch it again
   newtypes and no kids  so its not gundam anime
  monsha    were not really supposed to like monsha
  are we supposed to like gato kou everybody else too because guess what they couldnt make me like them    at least monsha was a cunt and good at it but still unlikeable
  are we supposed to like gato    no
  i wouldnt dare thats why there is /a and other boards as well
  you can respect his dedication at least
  ninaposting ruined discussion   everything will eventually devolve into being about how a woman acted so irrationally and got everything to blow up    dendrobium is the sexiest machine ever designed by man
  he is the best character in the ova tho
  watched this for the first time like 6 months ago and yeah id say from the discussion regarding it i saw on /m/ its pretty much rated not over or under i think for once /m/ was on the ball with this one its kind of horseshit    now dont get me wrong the animation was gorgeous and the mecha were a and all the political intrigue leading into the political climate of zeta was kino but the main characters fucking killed it for me monsha and his cronies were annoying burning was cool but died too soon keith was fine but unremarkable aside from getting best girl kou was pants on head retarded and his girlfriend nina aided in the committing of a war crime i also felt just about most of the stuff on the moon couldve been cut with little lost in fact lots of the downtime between battles on the albion also felt like crap to me but i cant hold that against the scenes themselves since i just didnt like the characters to begin with so of course the stuff focussing on them isnt going to do it for me    the devils really in the details on this one bullet pointing it really makes it seem like everything youd want out of a gundam side story but once you finally watch it its just not that great
  the poster count didnt budge
  dont know what to tell you kiddo thats the first post ive put in this thread
    his dedication to ideals he cant even outline or articulate his determined effort to help his men survive the futile and pointless conflict he started and lead them into his dedication to dying in battle which he could have easily done without condemning billions of people to starvation his dedication to continuing a war his nation started and lost because the deaths of 90 of the human race wasnt enough    gato is char if you systematically stripped away everything that made him a compelling and charismatic character youre just left with a hypocritical massmurdering red baron knockoff who pilots a cool robot
  the zeon ace is almost always the best character in his series     thats why zeta is the best because they figured out to just make the zeon ace the overt protagonist
  no pseudo geopolitical  philosophy musing and arguments    0083 is a pretty bad real robot show
  my favorite is 08th still but damn 0083 was fucking amazing     the 2nd op is better   men of destiny
  its top gun not paths of glory
  i sat through the entirety of the uc timelime starting late september 2017mid feburary 2018 victory took almost 3 months to finish as 1 i got bored and 2 i thought it was meh desu
  monsha is one of the precursors to why the titans were so fuck up from top to bottom    from a zeta perspective hes one of the ooohhh i get it characters
  its less her character moreso the bullshit they pulled to stuff in an unnecessary love triangle    nina suffers because of the plot not the other way around
  but its just because theyre afraid of having their performance compared to other men  thats not a fair statement i find virginity before marriage pretty important but i dont think that idea a plus has even once entered my head
0083 isnt shit because i saw it on toonami
  no mention of men of destiny  once again op was a flaming faggot
  youre not talking about the mc why
  ken burns on this scene while the space saxophone plays out the end of the intro    god i fucking loved this series    ill hop on this bandwagon ive always taken the fact that /m/ hates 0083 so much to be a sign that its truly a great show  i used to be kind of assmad about how much hate this got on here but these days im more pissed that every remix of the winner cuts out the fuckign space saxophone      go back to /a/frica    on a serious note though i dont think thats the reason why people really criticize her its not the fact that she was in a relationship gato at some point that people dislike although theyll make a lot of r9k tier jokes about it as much as it was the execution of the love triangle itself i also dont think its fair to say that most people on here are looking for a woman thats a perfect virgin waiting for them their entire lives let alone looking for a woman of that sort in fucking fiction of all things
  pic unrelated but wth its a baller looking haman     peak animation   rocking soundtrack   men of destiny   zaku f2s and gm kais   rip burning   cameo of haman   carrots   gato   last hurrah of zeon   evergreeeeeeen    one of the best series
  whats hard to articulate he refuses to accept that zeon lost and keeps on going
  i didnt know 0083 was ever on toonami
  whens the haman cameo
  not posting the best opening song of any gundam       you blew it op
  i bet your favorite part about this pic is the bulge from hamans huge cock
  nah thats just her puffy diaper its mandatory that floofy gals wear one
  its her psychoframaru actually
  and floof
  shit think its episode 9 when they encounter axis in space and haman is like fuck em fuck delaz
    lacks one thing show the colony hitting the american midwest then it would be perfect
does anyone know a site to watch stardust memory eng sub
  dendrobium is the sexiest machine ever designed by man    i concur 0083 has topnotch mechanical designs throughout and the gp03 is the raddest of them all
when i was like 9 or 10 we were visiting my grandpa and i went with him to walmart to get some groceries and he got me a toy i picked out a gp01 action figure i had already seen wing but it turned me on to gundam proper as i think msg was airing at the time he died when i was 12     0083 will always hold a special place for me anyone who is on the fence or outright dislikes it should give the manga a read    pls like and subscribe
  upvote for your gramps   seriously
  thots and god tier amazons and space nazis naziing it up and great robot fights  basically life itself in a single ova series
relevant
  shitty anime writing that takes up 90 of the runtime  but thats all anime silly    trying to make a point of it with 0083 is trivial
  also kawamori as mecha designer for gp01 and gp02
who is that girl with blond hair
gigi from hathaways flash
  shes an absolute qt will she be fine
  no  tomino make she sucks gross things
  well that sucks
  shes a prostitute  but not a newtype  so 5050 odds
  my new waife
  purustitute
  from what ive seen of her in the games she sucks and i dont like her
  she fucks old fat men for their money but she survives to the end and becomes a good lady      shes not a prostitute just a thot      a cuckold
  lurk more newfag
  she should have died
gunple fine too
  what are the virtues of the io frame compared to literally any of the others
  it looks cool and it cost less
orga never pilots his suit in the show
  and he was two days away from retirement
  sooo i havent watched ibo how much are these cool looking fellas featured in it
  id say moslty around s2 compared to 1 where it was sparingly and they had only a few frames on their side if i recall
arent the io frames literally shittier than grazes and only made for their reproducibility
  yep
  low cost and easy maintenance according to the released info about it its weaker than a graze and the main focus was mass production
    shittier than a mech not meant for mech vs mech combat  ouch
25 or so years later with new technology new shidens would be built for suit vs suit combat  shiden iv legionary  grunt suit   shiden iv centurion  officer suit  shiden iv praetorian  bodyguard/special operations suit
  people still actually lose to shidens anyway  oof
  oof  ugh
  he was finally going to pound that milf pussy
i enjoyed 2199 and im going to watch the original after i finish bubblegum crisis fite me  my real question does the space yamato fight so many battles and tank so much fucking damage because the real yamato spent most of its life in dry dock and sunk in its second battle
  no it fights and survives because the anime would end on the second episode if it didnt
    yeah its the hero ship i dont really get what youre asking
  it has shields
what did /m/ think of angels egg not exactly /m/ but has heavy cyber elements like gits and such
first for penis tanks
i very much enjoyed it i dont pretend to understand every little detail but the atmosphere was conveyed effectively and i kept thinking about it for a while after watching it    i really dont think its /m/ though there are some tanks some kind of firearm thing and the overturned ark at the ends but thats not nearly enough
i dig the amano visuals    now on the mamoru oshii side of things he also wrote seraphim 266613336 wings its another story about a girl angel this one stopped aging for reasons that arent explained shes the only person immune to a terrible plague decimating humanity the main character has a dream which changes from his wife holding their baby to the angel girl holding a baby then the main characters priest buddy tells him that if the angel girl had a kid itd probably also be immune to the plague and they would be able to use the angel girls hypothetical child to develop a cure therefore the priest tells the mc the fate of the world rests on if this angel girl gets pregnant the sooner the better he doesnt explain why they cant just use the angel girl to develop a cure now oshii never finished the manga but that legitimately seemed like the endgame he was aiming for take the angel girl home and get a baby out of her anyways that puts a different perspective on the scene in angels egg where the dude smashes the girls egg with his big gun    tldr mamoru oshii just wants to fuck the angel loli
  no it fucking doesnt have cyber elements  it just has penis guns and a a big floaty thing   which makes it closer to zardoz     what it does have in common with gits is totally unrelated to /m/ water wonky bible passages little girls and faceless statues     not that it matters anyway youre the shitposter from /a/ trying to bait on /m/ under a very loose pretense
  anyone would have figured as much seeing how many of his movies include le spooky ayylmao loli    but its nice to have a confirmation that oshii has a weirdo sex fetish on top of just finding that motif cool
  mamoru oshii was the virgin loli  imo whole movie felt like oshiis disillusionment with christianity he was once monk in training just like stalin    weird surreal movie alright but not /m/
  are we sure his parents just didnt send him to bible camp to make him pray the gay away after seeing him pretending to be the little girl
  i think youre reading too much into his angel fetish
  you underestimate the genius mister oshii  its actually a lolicon fetish cleverly disguised as a doll fetish cleverly disguised as a statue fetish cleverly disguised as an angel fetish
  i think you cracked the code
    oshii when he is not doing zanny meta comedy likes to pretend to be tarkoskvy doing anime
  and he also likes reminding you that hes read the broble real good
  muh boogeyman  not everything is us vs them anon
  no its actually that one faggot vs everyone else
  it was super nice    watch garm wars and see various elements lifted from it into a live action
  what did he even do

all right a little over a year ago i missed a pretty good thread started by the everelusive vfkun no less and have been kicking myself for it since then so here ill start my own and hope its even half as good as that one    whats your favorite episode
i really liked the screaming skull episode including the opening robot rumpus short
i just watched jack frost and the bruteman not really sci fi movies but funny episodes
  oh wow youre still with us first reply even youve just made my day also best host segment ever in my opinion          ill always remember that one because back in the day my dad was walking through the room while it was on and got a pretty good laugh when mike said someones radial saw went through a nail      its been a while i have to rewatch those
deathstalker and the warriors from hell  the brain that wouldnt die  the sword and the dragon  attack of the the eye creatures  the touch of satan  merlins shop of mystical wonders
ive been enjoying revenge of the mysterons from mars a lot lately  its a shit movie edit of some captain scarlett episodes
    for that ep
the devil doll episode was a fun one too
an episode i like      ktma 08  gamera vs guiron    years before they did them in season 3 they covered the gamera oeuvre on their closed beta test on uhf tv in minneapolis   gamera v guiron is basically cruise control for heckling so they do a decent job with it despite not being tightly scripted like later seasons  not a bad place to try the ktma run if youre uncertain    mst had a decent variety of toku with the two godzillas various gameras misc tsuburaya pro series prince of space neptune men legend of dinosaurs
  apparently frank goes to the same clothing store as the guy on the right
  prince from space my goodness that one was great the dubbing from said film helped
      theres some of the prince of space tv series out there too
joel a shit  mike is best mst3k host
mike was good at hosting a popular scifi themed puppet comedy show  joel was good at being a weird guy who was shot into space
  i have to watch pod people again    i find it hard to pick a favorite because i enjoy just about every episode but ill go with the gamera movies    i remember finding a stream about 8 or 10 years ago that even had a few episodes from the cable access season i remember a sandy frank dub of a movie with dinosaurs killing people at a lake near mt fuji cant remember what it was called
  i just dont think youre ready for some football
  shit man i just watched lazerblast for like the 8th time yesterday
  i said it last time but i still think its one of their strongest just because of it being a really amazing finale even if it didnt end up being the actual finale its a combination of having really strong riffs and great host segments that makes it stand out    i dont know if id call it my 1 but its definitely up there just because of how great of an episode it is
  i remember finding a stream about 8 or 10 years ago that even had a few episodes from the cable access season i remember a sandy frank dub of a movie with dinosaurs killing people at a lake near mt fuji cant remember what it was called  ktma was a small uhf not cable access but yeah thats the legend of dinosaurs      if youre looking for a 24/7 mst stream i keep one going on 420chans synchtube clone taima tv  laserblasts pretty cool over on one of futabas figure boards ive seen somebody with some figs i guess garage kits of the aliens from it possibly the same guy who had the fig of the monster from it conquered the world
  i think prince of space any of the gameras invasion of the neptune men pod people and wild world of batwoman are the top of the heap
  youre talking about attack of the supermonsters which was izenborg in japan
  pretty sure that particular bad dub movie edit of a tsuburaya show wasnt on mst3k they had mighty jack star wolf and saru no gundan instead  
  i kinda wish they got something like aizenborg or any cut up anime movie just so we could hear them comment on that sweet sweet japanimation
  there was a few seconds of the the ultraman anime in merlins shop of magical wonders in the evil monkey doll part      but yeah supermonsters wouldnt have been a bad fit for the show
  something like technopolice 21c wouldve been great too    
the incredible melting man episode is a treat    the bizarre scene with grandma trying to give grandpa a handjob while he drives because he said theyd go steal lemons is something ill never forget
  i kinda wish they got something like aizenborg or any cut up anime movie just so we could hear them comment on that sweet sweet japanimation  supposedly they have a rule about not riffing animation as its apparently a lot harder for them to riff that kind of thing compared to live action stuff
  i know ive heard mike say that subtitled material is harder to work with because everybody reads at different speed so they cant respond to dialog with exact timing
  since seeing that one i cant hear pop the weasel without feeling a certain modicum of amusement      id say they both have their merits      wild world of batwoman    i still cant figure out what was going on in that movie half the time i found myself wondering what everyone involved in making it was smoking      its something else satan created japanimation    harsh but funny      i was half expecting a jump cut to john cleese seated at a desk and saying and now for something completely different      really i did it all the time for a number of anime titles      okay subtitles now thats different
i forgot tom servos dad was gigantor  
  ive heard that the movie was originally supposed to be a parody of your typical monster on the loose film but the producers wanted it to be a more straightforward horror film against the directors wishes
  i still cant figure out what was going on in that movie  iirc a lot of the footage is from other movies like the opening scene with the guy getting mugged the mole people footage and some of rat finks footage is from one of the aztec mummy movies that came before robot vs aztec mummy    subtitles  yeah it came up with rifftraxs cover of dwar dragon wars which is partly in korean    im not sure if i took caps of it but one time on futaba robo i think somebody posted one of those name all the robots pics and one of the robots was crow so there were a few posts asking and explaining the character   somebody posted a cap like this which led to confusion about why his name is written with all the extra os
  gigantor    that anything like tetsujin no 28
  they stay pretty casual about the japanese cartoons except for one instance in season 2 singing the mach go go go lyrics for the speed racer song in godzilla vs megalon      in other lyrical choices in the ktma version of gamera theres a few bars of save the earth from g vs the smog monster too  
how does everyone feel about the netflix relaunch
  i was okay with it i have to handicap that with the fact i started back in season 1 on the comedy channel so ive been dealing with mst3k changing since 1990 after twenty five years or so a lot of the stings taken out of it  the riffing was mostly good same for the movies i wasnt too hot on it all has to be widescreen and color but it worked out okay carnival magic in particular was the sort of weird and bad that mst3k works well with for me a few of the movies id already seen which confused the hell out of me with time travelers  biggest complaint i had was the voices lacked range they all sound like cinematic titanic josh weinstein which made me look at the shadows more which made me notice how little crows mouth moved more the host segments with jonah and the bots were usually fun enough   also without the core gag of theyre just standing behind a screen the random ship encounters arent funny at all in any way      word on the onlines out of the uk is season 12 has  mac and me  atlantic rim  lords of the deep  the day time ended  ator like the first movie in the series that included cave dwellers
    its dreadful theres no wit its basically just noise and both patton oswalt and felecia day can go straight to hell
  the best mst3k episodes tend to be the movies that are just a bizarre mess not just bad but really odd
  what the hell this actually got funded and put in netfix  this timeline keeps getting worse and worse  was it true joel didnt contact anyone from the original group to help with the new show both those who worked with him to do cinematic titanic or the mike faction of rifftrax
    its a famous geek ip of course netflix was quick to grab it amd rebrand it for the new hip crowd as far as i know the rumors about joel screwing with the rifftrax side is untrue for what thats worth all the same though the mike era was waaaaaaaaaaaay better and it shows
    it just ends with a rando black janitor cleaning up the monster casually with put upon frustration    10/10 never before has there been a better way to cap off a film
    the only thing ill remember from it is that it was allegedly a success at the box office and robotcop used it as inspiration for one of their scenes       i shouldnt be shocked that netflix grabbed hold of it the last i heard of it it was just a kickstarter and joel and zero people from the original show on board   i do see your point in joel vs miek though the mikes era allowed for more flexibility in the movies done since joel preferred they stick to scifi while mike was alright with anything also character wise joel was a father figure to the bots while mike was a buddy so the latter would have better synergy     you know the one thing i realized since this is just on basic cable it means they would have had to have edited out content if it was not suitable so that makes me wonder how much of a movie did they have to cut for content and time
    well even their styles of humor where pretty night and day joel is extremely dry which normally i am too but for ripping on movies i think you really need to be a lot more rapid fire mike seems better at improv
season 11 has bobo brain guy and pearl i think theyre all the real actors but ill be honest i didnt check and the host segments were ass enough that im not sure since i mostly fastforward      you know the one thing i realized since this is just on basic cable it means they would have had to have edited out content if it was not suitable so that makes me wonder how much of a movie did they have to cut for content and time  theres a lot of stuff that got on basic cable by virtue of being buried in a comedy puppet show especially comedy central which was extremely inconsistent about nudity one of the biker flicks has a wall with a bunch of smut on it that they even point out in the riffs creeping terror has bare titties and im not sure of any gore that got cut for content from melting man
  what the hell this actually got funded and put in netfix    what rock did you crawl out from under
  its dreadful theres no wit its basically just noise  where do you think you are
  the final sacrifice a canadian classic
soultakers another really great episode the movies a fun watch just for how silly it gets but they really kill it when ever brad or actor robert zdar is on the screen    i also appreciate all the references to hardees/carls jr that litter the episode
  the set pieces and miniatures are amazing and the host isnt as bad as expected though the worst host  the voices of crow and tom just dont work they feel like bad impressions corbits crow worked because he didnt try to imitate trace like this crow does  the mads seem tryhard and never come off as endearing  the actual riffs range from funny to dry they usually feel unpolished
  ya got mud on your face ya big disgrace  shovin those sandwiches into your face  singin we will we will rowsdower
      the interview with him is also nice
    rowsdower saves us and saves all the world
  rip in beer zap rowsdower  _7
  would it have been a lesser mess or an even bigger mess without the executive meddling
  lesser mess or an even bigger mess  melting man  mess  oh you    
  cat not related
  i assume its the institute for space politics resident cat
  yeah i figured my cat getting in the way of my gamera laserdiscs was as good a pic as anything else
  gamera    for some reason i read that as german at a cursory glance
i find myself going back to pod people soultakerboggy creek 2 and squirm pretty often    out of curiousity does the new season suck ass
    i found it acceptable but im also very fond of ktma and season 1
  ktma    
  before they were on cables the comedy channel with whats commonly called season 1 they ran on a local uhf station ktma tv23 for about twenty episodes
  my alltime favorite has to be space mutiny but i havent rewatched it in ages because it reminds me of a girl    other than that  devil fish  riding with death  the day the earth froze  the phantom planet  the screaming skull    and of course the final sacrifice
  was it not hyphenated
  not that i know of     i think theres some instances when call letters get a hyphen after the k/w like ktma or wxyz but i dont think theres any particular rule about it
  is it me or does tom kind of look like a psycommu zaku
  i can sorta see it
    looks more like a petite mobile suit to me
  it really does
went to mst3k live a couple weeks ago and it was great riffs were on their agame and joel and jonah fighting each other was cool it was so much better than the netflix season dont know if thats a sign the next season will be better or they put more effort in this than a usual episode
  went to mst3k live a couple weeks ago    where
  why not both
  the host segments were ass enough that im not sure since i mostly fastforward
  the stuff with jonah and the bots was usually okay but the rest of it didnt do anything for me  i similarly fastforwarded through the host segments for much of the scifi run for a while until i warmed up to it over time
  jonah    literally who
  new host from the netflix season    probably the leastweak part of the new run
    thats just sad
  in the short the truck farmer attached to i accuse my parents they also have a riff where they chant go speed farmer go speed farmer go speed farmer go
  yeah they do the english language version a few times but only in gvs megalon do they do it in moonspeak    i dont remember the ep but im pretty sure there was a riff about a shot of a spaceship resembling the cover of tomitas the planets but they never put it together that isao tomita of the tsuburaya pro shows they covered was that tomita
  this and pod people are probably my favorites i also like that one about the barbarian guy with the pie plate on his chest who at one point pulls out a hang glider from nowhere i dont remember the name    as for the netflix show i like it a lot though i took a little bit to get used to it the pace of the riffing is much faster and the host segments just arent the same though i dont think they are bad i am a fan of patton oswalt so it was cool that he was there
  i also like that one about the barbarian guy with the pie plate on his chest who at one point pulls out a hang glider from nowhere  cave dwellers      title leaks out of the uk say the first movie in the ator series will be in season 12
  thanks    i also want to say that touch of satan and mitchell are really great too in case someone is looking at this thread for recommendations i guess
  gotta love toms criticism of that    okay so he kills a deer he tans the hides he stretches the skins he makes an anodized aluminum frame he learns how to extrude and weld all in about five minutes huh    pretty spoton
you know ive been on /m/ for over a decade and i never once thought to see if instituteforspacepoliticsorg was a real site color me surprised
  so what is it
  oh i thought you were referring to og mst3k
  yeah i wasnt too specific there sorry    it conquered the world is a fun invading alien one a lot of strong speeches by the cast including beverly garland reading the alien the riot act when she goes after him with a shotgun
  beverly garland    any relation to judy
  from what im seeing from google signs point to no      for it conquered the world but beverly was in a few mst movies appeared on one of the turkey day marathons and also was one of the guests at the first mst3k convention
  she a fan or did she just have nothing better to do
its a short but last clear chance is probably my favorite    trains are blameless holy creatures  many people who have lived through a crossing accident say ahhhhhhhh  would you identify this bucket full of your brother    for full movies id have to same pumaman  helpimfallingata60degreeanglebreakingallthelawsofphysics  i hate your crotch  pumaman he flies like a moron    i think it was back in 11 when a /m/an would stream an mst3k weekly and a bunch of us would watch it good times i remember watching baby snakes after an episode
  why not both
  iirc those the streams where for invasion of the neptune men as that endless sequence of the spaceships flying around i went up to the corner store to get a beer and came back and it was still going        i think she did a number of cons and stuff based on being beverly garland b movie / tv actress  glancing at her wiki it looks like she had an income stream from her husbands hotel and worked tv fairly regularly through the 90s  from what i remember the guests at the con seemed okay with it all they also had guy who directed warrior of the lost world and guy who played mikey in teenage strangler
  that means you missed the best part    they took out the hitler building wheres everybody gonna go to see hitler memorabilia etc
   get outta town accident lover
  ah the hitler building    i just couldnt bear to see it go
  i think it was back in 11 when a /m/an would stream an mst3k weekly and a bunch of us would watch it  i remember that what was his name
  was that rmd i think it was one of the justice_time ish crew
    wasnt it kaijuphenia
  yeah that sounds right
  hqdefault    why they do this what ever happened to maxresdefault
  theres a reason its called screwtube
  i dunno i just wanted an easy pic of the hitler building    first spaceship on venus is a nice one breezy season 2 riffing based on a stanislaw lem novel  kinda weird eastern bloc sf about an international crew on a mission to venus has a chirpy robot a spaceship some other odds and ends too      not as edited down as humanoid woman was from to the stars by hard ways but wiki says its still missing a decent chunk in the dubbing process
  how do you mean edited down why is it missing
  humanoid woman is significantly longer as sandy frank took what was as far as i recall two movies and mashed them into a very shorter version most noticeably a subplot about an octopus alien is cut entirely  iirc the common version these of the russian language release is a directors cut dropping some ideological stuff but still containing a lot more than humanoid woman    humanoid woman      чepeз тepнии к звeздaм 1980 1я     чepeз тepнии к звeздaм 1980 2я      im not sure whats missing from first spaceship on venus never watched it raw earlier online rumors said it was cut by a lot more wiki these days puts it around 15mins with some mentions of hiroshima dropped
  dropping some ideological stuff    
  no idea honestly  thats my poor recollection of what ive read the way it was described it sounded like there was some odds and ends going hooray for soviet values that were forced in by the government but ive never bothered to go through the different versions ive downloaded over the years with a finetoothed comb to notice any specific differences for all i know its bunk
  i just wanted an easy pic of the hitler building    that seems to be the only pic of the hitler building
  what ever happened to that guy
  it sounded like there was some odds and ends going hooray for soviet values    they didnt seem to have any hangups about that in the battleship potemkin

  well mike was the head writer so it probably made it easier to get more free flowing material out since before he had to go by joel my only regret was they axed the inversion exchange i know why it had to go but it was always fun to see what random junk they came up with      i actually do have a copy of the incredible melting man somewhere and if my continually deteriorating memory can be trusted i dont believe they did cut any of the violence i mean they did let that fishermans head get ripped off float down a creep and then shatter as if feel down a waterfall that as probably the most graphic scene of violence   as for what is and isnt allowed since its basic cable its in that fun no mans land of self regulation where they technically arent regulated by the fcc but no one wants to push the envelope and then be blamed for the fcc stepping in to regulate cable       do they have any pictures of the bunker
  what bunker
  because it got annexed by screwgle
  in the movie invasion of the neptune men theres a very brief shot of a building with hitler on it getting blown up   ive heard its stock footage from after wwii or that its from some war movie    either way its an odd thing to run into in the middle of random normal buildings blowing up mike and the bots make light of the idea by expressing great sadness and anger that the hitler building has been destroyed and cite the restaurant the bunker as one of the aspects of the hitler building that will be missed    also the trailers out for season 12  only one that the uk didnt leak was killer fish
you didnt win  i didnt want to  what were you cloned from a sack of doorknobs or something  im writing that down  why  im writing that down as well  boy this is really starting to stack up
  dont be silly a sack of doorknobs doesnt even have any dna to clone
some new alt modes for the bots from that trailer presumably from atlantic rim  also it looks like that rowlf the dog ish bot is sticking around    i really show get some good caps of the times they look different like the refueling scene from skydivers or that time they transformed crow into a highspeed mode to send him down the umbilicus
  only one that the uk didnt leak was killer fish    
  up at     was some titles for season 12 that were leaked by some uk ratings board type process  i didnt see killer fish on that list     the ad thats out for 12 shows all six movies of the season    robot vs the aztec mummy unrelated  
    the hitler building is a movie theater with a marquee advertising the 1960 documentary mein kampf
  and they blew up the theater  ive heard of a movie being a bomb but thats ridiculous
  looked more like mine sic kampf
  its a box office bomb
    wahewilf is probably my favorite episode honestly
    tfw the actor who played rowsdower died this year    press f to pay respects
  i wonder if you can drink f
  rather demoralizing how many celebs have been dropping like flies in recent years      i didnt realize mst3k had any following in japan    クルウウウウウ    cröe
  from what ive seen theres some awareness of its existence but i dont think ive seen subs or anything  iirc that was one of those name the robots pics and thus the discussion of croooow
megaweapon vs gundamwho wins
  gundam megaweapon got taken out by a dude on a motorcycle
  megaweapon    
  whyd they make a theater look like an office building
apparently they got the movie
  what did you mean leak
  they emptied their load pan without meaning to  there hadnt been an official announcement but word came out because of legal regulations like when trademarks and toy catalogs spoil things
annual turkey day marathon    
  oh shit thanks for the headsup    i had foolishly expected it would be on thanksgiving like usual
  yeah they moved it up a few days
theyve got moon zero two starting    hammer the horror guys make a very 2001inspired moon western kinda not that bad of a movie actually
  yeah you can definitely see the influence of gerry anderson and other films on it
  even if he never himself worked on it
  checking imdb shows the guy who did art direction also did fire maidens from of outer space  and millions eyes of sumuru     theyre not as coollooking
  an additional anderson connection is catherina von schell who was also in space1999 a few years later pic related

okay guys were going to run short bits of episodes to fill time and well be running them every break for thirty hours so wed better make a lot  you mean like three  no at least five
  ah heck and here i am with other things demanding my attention
  what you expect effort from shout factory
  not really no
press f for megaweapon
fucked up the interlacing on the turkey day flashback clip  wow shout just wow   like if the supermarket gave out stale bread as a sample hoping to make me buy bread      f    bloodlust is on its a most dangerous game thing
  i probably have a better copy of it on the pirated collection i downloaded ten years ago
  i dont know why but i have a strange sexual attraction to crow t robot    dunno
ah child labour and endangerment
  thing    read ripoff
clay pigeons bottles with a 22lr  40 year old teenagers     this film going to be good
  not sure neither the wiki for bloodlust nor the most dangerous game say anything about it being unauthorized
  ripoff doesnt necessarily mean bootleg
well that was something i hope its a fantasy film next
samson vs the vampire women
this was the only lucha movie they covered iirc this was franks choice for his last episode bumping a third master ninja out of the way    the legends as i heard them was that the brains werent interested in doing lucha movies after robot vs the aztec mummy but did it because it was franks final show    good stuff vampire women awaken for a demonic plot only el santo can wrestle them and their minions
  bumping a third master ninja out of the way  good
  boggy creek 2 and the legend continues all that crenshaw talk
  merlins shop of mystical wonders  fuck i forgot that one amazing episode
  i know a guy irl who is mildly butthurt about it because he was unironically into the master when he was a kid    i wish theyd done the other two dubbed santo movies rifftrax covered at least one of the neutron the atomic superman movies iirc he was a movieoriginal luchador and didnt work the gimmick in the ring  the guy wolf ruvinskis had been a wrestler who wiki says retired early due to injuries
  nice to see youre still around i was worried you mightve left us
  snap into a slim jim
and if you need more lucha movie riffing theres a very original show in spanish that i assume is from mexico  
  the episodes were great riff material but i have no idea how the kid played by tim van patten ever got an acting career he mumbles every line and was just infuriating to watch on screen it was pretty great when the master was the focus though and he was the basis of some great gags       i am the shadow that judges this board    you have been found wanting and shall be punished
  this shall undoubtedly be painful
i liked when frank comes back they actually reference this segment and he starts talking about how second banana heaven is so political and that people had it out for him since day 1
  i have no idea how the kid played by tim van patten ever got an acting career  afaik it was mostly for being the halfbrother of dick van patten    yeah it was a cute bit working him in as a soultaker since he was dead
those previews for the new mst3k  the main guys look and sound okay but the mads seem a little eh       afaik it was mostly for being the halfbrother of dick van patten  yeah they kept making fun of him for it in the episode from now on if anyone complains about kids in mecha anime im just gonna point to tim and tell them hes worse than any katz or quess
next up laserblast last ep of the comedy central run      im okay with jonah and the modern bots jonahs got good energy in his delivery    and yeah the mads arent so hot kinga needs to turn up the mad by about five notches tvs son of tvs frank is a decent basic gag but theres not much more there   i think they might have worked out better if theyd done it over some length of time to get used to doing the characters instead of the really short shoot they apparently had    i like the band more than anything else from the moon 13 gang
  next up laserblast last ep of the comedy central run  thats my favorite of the mike episodes     im okay with jonah and the modern bots jonahs got good energy in his delivery  i hope its better scripted and with better delivery than these host segments with joel hes awful in these
  yeah hes been kinda meh hosting the marathon    s11s worth a watch but keep your expectations low
keenan wynns character in this is what im like when i first wake up
  halfbrother of dick van patten    wait seriously
  i thought he was son of dick but wiki says halfbrother  im not that up on white shadow castturnedtv directors
going for some football
next is cry wilderness from season 11    goofy bigfoot movie sorta nature thing    i didnt pay much attention to laserblast was a great lucha extrema match on aaa really good flaming table spot for the finish
  i honestly dont think mst3k got good until season 3 which was god tier
  yeah 3 was really when they hit their stride for that cast
  tom losing his shit    always a treat  
  and here i thought he lost it in 
  when did frank join the cast
  2 2 isnt bad but its mostly just then getting their footing so theres some great ones and meh ones mixed in 3 is where the show becomes beautiful
  
  watched a youtube interview with all the cast and none of them particularly liked the manos episode they said they were distracted by how creepy it was to make good riffs and one of them said it was like watching a snuff film
  his first onscreen appearance is season 2 but theres a riff referencing him like hey he looks like frank conniff back in the ktma eps
christ this new season is bad i miss mike
who here went to one of the live shows     deathstalker 2 was so bad i was rolling had a fucking blast    also prince of space is my favorite episode
  who here went to one of the live shows  none of the modern ones but i did see one of the this island earth beta test live shows at conventioconexpofestarama
    when was that who was there
  what was the deal with mst3k the movie anyways ive heard tell that they were sorta hoping itd be a big success but i cant imagine a movie crowd getting behind it
  1994 it was mike trace and kevin riffing as mike and the bots frank and trace as the mads  they did basically the early version of the movie script lots more movie lots more riffs host segments were doing various songs toobular boobular joy janitor song i think they did endless frank and crow did a variant of his kim cattrall song  biggest things that stand out that got dropped were some of the more inside stuff like circle pines and a lot of the scenes with cal breaking things which leaves the nothing left to break joke falling flat
  i dunno  as far as i understand the theory was to transition to doing movies regularly and maybe phase out tv  the success of the rifftrax fathom events seems to indicate that there was something to it to a degree but with the tech at the time requiring physical film prints it didnt pan out   universal getting cold feet shuffling it to grammercy or whatever and then putting it out the same weekend as they put all their advertising into barb wire basically torpedoed whatever hope it had
  i tried watching season 11 and i just didnt like it that much i think the biggest issue i had was that everyone was trying too hard and nothing felt natural    the host doesnt have the natural charisma of joel or the spot on delivery of mike the new mads just seem like theyre giving it too much effort to emulate the previous ones a reason i actually liked pearl was because she was so different from her son and the new voices of tom and crow just feel like bad impressions of tom and crow and are more focused on that line delivery
  dont let a double track double cross you
  you see son we all die alone and afraid
  i can only commiserate the mst3k cast and crew and i really have to ask what was even the point
    the one rumor i remember being spread is that jim mallon long time voice of gypsy and shows producer was the one behind the big push for it he was convinced it was a perfect match and that they needed this to push mst3k forward
  i actually didnt mind most of the new cast except felecia day i dont have anything against her but she is not meant to be playing the role of mad scientist and she doesnt fit the role at all however i do agree that a lot of it felt forced on the sol and in the theater i didnt think things were that bad and enjoyed it by the end of the season but almost everything involving the mads was bad i think patton oswalt did an okay job but day and the writing dragged him down i could also barely stand the we have a massive budget but were going to pretend we have no budget look that much of the show had going for it especially the opening i found the new op to be godawful
  does it exist uncut
  not publicly available that i know of    iirc theres been footage released of some of the host segments by best brains or shout so its likely the entire event was recorded but i dont think its reasonable to expect an official release
    i watched the first two episodes and couldnt get into it at all the rapidfire style of riffing was just annoying there was no time between jokes and you could barely hear the movie so youd miss lines that theyre riffing on everything felt really forced like they had no filter in the writing room and just put every halfassed joke someone said into the script     ill check out the new season a little at least for mac and me so i hope its better
  in my headcanon the sol is always much larger and has many comfy rooms for the bots to hang out in and get up to shenanigans when theyre not watching movies
this probably sounds cringey now but i miss those old days when mst3k was a relatively rare fandom to the point where if you met someone who knew the show you almost implicitly understood they were a fairly smart guy with all kinds of interesting firsthand knowledge of esoteric nerdy stuff dd history and literature etc like if you met an mst3k fan in the 90s you just knew hed read every tolkien book front to back and could read the runes and discuss the silmarillion long before the jackson movies became a thing and nerd culture became a normalfag hot topic tshirt poseur fashion statement
  i was referring to universal why sign on to the endeavor just to welch at the last moment      disappointing but at least its there
  might have been some management shuffle during production hollywood is great at ruining things    aircheck of turkey day 1995 including the ads like for the new aptiva at radio shack its a computer that can play videos      
  you know where i can grab the torrent for that planet prince upload
  no but i can probably scrounge up my copy and put it on mega or something
  nice let me know
anyone watch the new season yet how bad is the riffing this time or did they actually improve
  i forgot to download it lol  ill probably catch some of it in a few days    no luck yet on the first external drive ill try some more tomorrow
  pearl and corbetts crow worked because they werent scared of being different than what they were replacing so the humor flowed just fine
  im a bit into the first one  the pacing seems a little more chill  also holy shit theyre short even with the credits and the opening theyre an hour twenty and change
i wont get salty that they pronounced evangelion with a soft g they fucked up pronouncing jokes the speaker didnt write a lot back in the day too
  the first few episodes didnt do much for me but i just finished up the day time ended and i really enjoyed it
  yeah i heard they cut out one of the host segments since theres no commercial breaks to work around and that really cut it down do they still do the annoying youre watching moon 13 the moon shit    also read that they recorded with all three of them in the same room this time which surprised me because i figured they wouldve done that in the last season as well     going to watch it this weekend and hopefully it doesnt suck as bad as season 11
i still hadnt actually watched atlantic rim   yeah i see why the common take ive seem was its more sincere than a lot of asylum and kinda not that shitty  it wasnt good by any means but the leaderish guy was red which is a nice touch    so far im not as meh on s12 as s11 ive still hit fast forward on some of the host segments but nowhere near as much as s11    i suspect a lot of the issues are doing these cormangrade shooting schedules instead of weekly like the old show as this new set seems more comfortable i think the fact they were coworkers for so much of the year really added to the familiarity they had with each other as opposed to the quick shoots for the new version      and damn that version of the closing the introduced in s11 is still way great   straightup fucking epcot center grade      yeah i heard they cut out one of the host segments since theres no commercial breaks to work around and that really cut it down do they still do the annoying youre watching moon 13 the moon shit  i hadnt noticed it but yeah now that i think about it i think they did i liked them but i liked the idea of knockoff inframan badguys as a band playing arrangements of old mst songs      also read that they recorded with all three of them in the same room this time which surprised me because i figured they wouldve done that in the last season as well  im not surprised they didnt for 11 but im glad to hear they did it for 12  9 was better than 8 but still had a lot of 8s weaknesses but it was an improvement thats about how im feeling 12 so far
  straightup fucking epcot center grade    
  it reminds me of the cool majestic stuff from the early years of epcot
  what years were those
  basically back when it was epcot center    really i think they kept much of the future world outdoor music loop intact through the nineties but im thinking more the stuff like the orchestral version of universe of energy as the movie starts to wrap up like around   much of the stuff from horizons like the intro stuff on this      i liked mighty science theater before but the new version really does it for me
  basically back when it was epcot center    is it not anymore
  technically no  heavy theme park autism ahead so bail out now if you dont care    it was epcot center being the showplace of a concept with an acronym meaning experimental prototype community/city of tomorrow from its open through 1993 then it was renamed epcot 94 epcot 95 then just epcot with those being abstract names rather than acronyms  as the name changes took place around the time of the shift more from an edutainment / worlds fair type of thing to drinking around the world gueststarring some rides up front
is it just me or does the theater seem bigger in the new seasons
  its just because its widescreen now so theres a few more seats than there used to be
  yeah thats a joel vs jim thing  when they moved to national distro jim/network said the seats needed to be bigger to accommodate plebs and their lack of overscan but in the ktma days they were the smaller seats    if youre more on the ktma2 wavelength the netflix seasons are more grokable
  be police officer  get called to a loud noise possibly a disturbance  guy opens the door turns out its just the tv  see a shelf with almost every mst3k dvd imaginable  spend the next ten minutes talking about mst3k with him and how good it is    good times
  grokable
  because nobody circulates tapes in this day and age
  zakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzaku  zakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzaku  zakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzaku  zakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzakuzaku
  i dont get it
  the seats needed to be bigger to accommodate plebs and their lack of overscan    
  some of my favorites are the final sacrifice space mutiny time chasers jack frost lazerblast the pod people pretty much all of the shorts and a few others im forgetting   i recently bought a dvd of a few mst3k episodes for my dad so i really should rewatch some of these episodes
  back in the day of crt screens there was a problem that not all tvs showed the entire screen  some would have the outer plastic obscuring the corners of the tube or whatever so you had to give a lot of margintype room to make sure everybody saw your thing    heres something from a few seconds in google
  the countdown rooms are actual rooms in the return
season 12 is actually pretty good 11 wasnt too bad but had a lot of rough edges the biggest issues are felicia day being a shit actor as usual toms voice doesnt shit him at all and desperately trying to the it to the old seasons and have some sort of stupid continuity theres zero chemistry between jonah and the mads
  thats how i imagined it from the movie
  thats just sloppy design right there
  oh definitely
  ntsc was a sloppy time
  good old crt tv even though its sloppy tech  back in my childhood days it last like a decade later it have pic distortion issue but a kick to tvs bottom can make it last for a year more before total kaput what a memory  too bad the days of brute force repair method was over
  
  how do you mean
  i meant sloppy as in negligent
i think  has a question
    oh okay  ntsc was a video format its not really that hot color was mashed in after the fact giving rise to the ancient dumb nerd joke never the same color  in these dinosaur ages when we carved our tvs out of stone theyd often end up with obscured views of the cathode ray tubes output along the edges particularly in the corners compared to the modern age where you lose at most a few pixels but nothing remarkable in your tv/monitors margins  i remember not knowing about the xp meter on pinball quest for many years because of such issues      negligent  buh
  i think he means they designed the cabinet assembly in such a way that ended up blocking about a quarter of the screen
what are some homages/ripoffs to mst3k      i remember one about aliens in an apartment watching movies and another one that was a ghetto theater and watched blacksploitation films
  i brought up a platicar a su casa earlier theyre a mexican take on the concept    russia brought us project popcorn  
  i remember one about aliens in an apartment watching movies    i seem to recall a former classmate of mine mentioning something about that i think she said it was called usa presents i havent been able to find anything by that title though so no definitive answers are forthcoming on my end
  inframan goons
  yeah similar to season 23s jerry and silvia the mole people the new one has inframan goons as the mads extras

  whats this thing from again
i like its design too bad it does nothing at all in t he show
  say something nice about your new smash rep
  this guys popping up all over the website lately huh
  once upon a time maybe but currently its doubtful it will be remember outside of niche crowd
  well thats no surprise since it is basically a shoujo anime i mean its good but i have no idea why they thought young american boys would like it
  go to any isekai thread on /a/ chances are escaflowne will get shilled there
  shilled  who exactly stands to profit from a 20 year old anime being watched
shut up
  same reason why people liked transformers transforming robots without gender identity crisis
  exactly what mecha series has a gender identity crisis
  modern transformers robots now are either a male or female transgender robot that was originally a male that was forcibly changed into a female transgender robot with an identity crisis gay robots in relationship with other gay robots female robot criticizing male robots
fortnites controls on switch just arent very good
  blue knight visual novel
  this combined with turning star saber into an edgy deus vult villain for no reason really pissed me off
  edgy deus vult villain  bit redundant
  its animation quality and widespread licensing make it a landmark its only entertaining to a weird niche but its something every old school anime fan knows
armor shrikes never get any love
  blue gender    i still want a sequel with more armor shrikes
  im still surprised this show actually aired on tv its the only reason anyone has ever heard of it probably just like kikaider
  a game
  fujita  my bad
  yeah
uwu

  nice avgn quote
  transformers
  it was from a mecha video game released in 1999 that was featured in the first issue of the tokyo robot news dont know the name
    hexamoon guardians
        god they had like an entire garage kit series of these that i wanted so badly i can only wish they sold them now
  thanks op the thread just suddenly reminded me of an oldass game that i completely forgot to finish
poor ms109 goblin
  i love you
  mostly because leaving the pilot criminally exposed is a bad thing

  why does /m/ have a laughing man spoiler thumbnail its not even a mecha anime
behold an obscure blue zaku varient/spoiler
  looks cool
  its not even a mecha anime  main character is a full body cyborg  most people have some sort of cybernetic augmentation  they drive ai mecha tanks  have you even seen a tachikoma before anon
  tachikoma is a mech not a mecha
  thank you for clearing that up
  looks like mazinger to me
  /m/ has a few that it switches between at random at the time of this comment its showing me the master asia spoiler thumbnail super spoiler
hm
can anyone identify this sd gundam    
  gundam muhdick
  mwll is my jam nigga
    whats this from and what emotion is uwu supposed to convey
  halo and its the sound a ghost makes
  its a bit sad that /aco/ is more helpful on this than /m/ is
  /m/ is polluted with sea monkey newfags
god mars
  look at those cute ass feet they look like little big shoes
  
  its an important distinction
  not here its not

ayaya
  fukken great game
    oh holy crap  thats the mecha from universe at war isnt it    man i loved walkers the hierarchy had
  onmitsu gundam from the musha comics/ova  he is a sneaky ninja
  rather interesting
this thread is by the virus buster serge and wing thread anon isnt it
  you think this is bad ive got some on a board where the bump limit is 500 and theyre not even halfway done i think i can drag those out until the end of the year at least
  source looks pretty cool
  boots warrior footclamp
  i think its from that spinoff of mlaios
    which is it
the mech itself isnt exactly obscure but i love the look of this concept design for big o
  i was pretty surprised to see him specifically shown in the direct its almost like sakurai is watching 4chan
hey sakurai we want ray mk iii
    i stopped paying attention to nintendo stuff did the new smash bros add a ccg mode or something
  nah its more like a more indepth version of the stickers from brawl you collect a variety of characters from various nintendo and even some nonnintendo games and equip them to boost your stats they also have a fuckton of themed matches to unlock them that try to set up the battles to be faithful to the spirit characters in some way like to unlock an owain spirit you fight chrom and he taunts all the time we have yet to see if they do anything for st falcon but there are a whole bunch of mii costumes for unexpected characters so maybe that    its not much but it is cool to see some truly obscure characters represented via this mode
  also i said nah but after sending that post i just realized that it does sound like a ccg in all factors but the use of cards so maybe yeah actually the actual gameplay of the mode reminds me more of weapon master from soul calibur ii though if anyone remembers that
ooh what if they had urkels shirt in there as a character
im told its called a sturmzack some kind of composite hizack custom mixed with the binders from a sturm dias
  this series has such good designs
  a zaku
  a security camera
  
  im not a gnouf  im not a gnyan  im a gnelf and youve been gnelfed
  what are the hockey pucks for
  im assuming those are magnetic mines
  did a rezel have a baby with a zaku
  oh shit i remember playing rifts
  kirbylooking motherfucker
  correct madox used these against the leopard tanks it was up against
  the best mech in the universe
  i have never seen anyone other than me post anything gaiarth related on 4chan before you more shows need to have robot wizards
  sakurai tweeted that he bought a layzner model because it would be relevant in smash i guess thats what he was referring to
  thats yugioh in a nutshell ever since zoodiacs non stop degeneracy at least when degenerate dragons died there was an era of relative peace and healthy meta now its just ftk the game for going on two years now
  tfw super quantals are a dead deck  i like mr4 but the sacrifices sometimes make me wonder if it was worth it
    ygo discussion always sounds like brain surgery to me i even watch the shows but half the time i have no idea what the fuck is going on just that it looks cool
  you dont need to know how super quantals worked just know that they did in fact look very cool
  what do you mean unplayable trains are ocg meta and are basically might gaine in card form
  i highly doubt its for st falcon he uses his toys to plan out animations and the st falcon spirit literally just entails importing a png into the game so the possibilities i see are that its for one of the new playable characters and nobodys made the connection somehow or for one of the bosses in world of light we did see galleom is back so it could be him with some new moves or potentially a new original boss or for a dlc character elma or it could be for content that was planned but scrapped or it could even be for a different game though i think thats unlikely because we learned about this back in 2016 and i cant imagine hed be working on another game alongside smash     writing all those down i think i am leaning towards the boss idea it just makes the most sense also it bears mentioning that its actually a vifam figure not layzner
  well i heard it from /v/ and im surprised that they name dropped an actual anime outside of gundam so i can forgive them for getting the series wrong
  im actually surprised they would even know layzner exists to get the series wrong in the first place like where would they have even heard of that name i too would have expected them to just call it a gundam toy
ahem    fuck sugiyama
so rare you wont even be able to find a screenshot from the series proper
  latch bum    every time
wondering wheres this from
  its an ova called takegami i remember trying to watch it several times and every release would fuck up at the end of the 2nd ep maybe it was my video codecs
  back in the 90s all sorts of weird things happened like the end of saga frontier was just a freeze frame as you beat the final boss and its not a glitch it really is the end of the game
  for a second i thought that was a messala variant that i didnt know about
  holy shit a hizack custom with a sturm dias backpack now this would be my gundam build fighters mobile suit its simple as hell and yet it makes me diamonds
hugh
not really obscure but jet alone gets largely overshadowed by all of the other eva mechs
my nigga blodia recently made a comeback
43 days  i knew this was a slow board but damn
  it has a cool name too
  normie anime fans really hate this episode  but imo its one of my favourites in this series  it got close to making evangelion feel more like a world with consequence and conflicts of international interest
  normies hate anything that requires thought its a wonder they like this show to begin with
      jet alone is baller as fuck
  this is like all the things i love combined into one image
  its a golem
  youre a golem
good ol jet alone
  you and i are now friendsanon
  solid choice
  is break blade really that obscure
  get that colorful blob shit out of here what thye hell is that thing
  aestevalis
  is this shopped the collectors edition came with a card that has that illustration but i couldnt find an actual book
  source
  yeah someone just made that because that art looks perfectly like the cover of an old scifi novel    i wish takahashi wrote books theyd probably be fucking sweet
  source please
  dt eightron
what was the one that has a dog commanding a ship  combine with mecha piloted by three tri something
  trider g7
do mobile armors count
  thats the one
  fun show wish it had regular subs but it got the point across
oh hell yes
  trizenom mechs were made by nadesico mechanical desegner the main battleship is a poor man nadesico
    most part of trizenom staff worked in slayers series  the character are based on slayers original designer  also the megumi hayashibara music in op and ed  jun fukuyama voiced a super robot pilot mc before gravion
  it also features the mcs dad taking down enemy robots with a pick axe this has been a public service announcement
  the mc dad voiced pic related
from the sfc game sd gundam gnext
    is it subbed
  hk subs only i believe
    nice franken
stop bumping this thread
an old favorite of mine
  this shit was fun back in the day my neighbor had it and i used to borrow the cartridge all the time
  cute girls and coolass manly dude with sunglasses  this seems to happen a lot in mecha anime
  moeagare ferrrnando
im a little late on this but i just found out theres a new srw with rayearth in it i guess rayearth is about to become a much less obscure mecha series but hey im not that big of a hipster actually i am but whatever welcome to the fold brothers
  a few people have been telling me to watch that for months something to do with my favourite srw character being drawn in the outfit of someone from it once i suppose i should watch at least one of the newcomers even if three of the supers are making me very hype already
  you basically cant go wrong with anything clamp though im not sure /m/ would appreciate it
  only good mecha series reporting
dont party just yet
  cocky little freak
always thought the ff13 gods would make neat mecha kits
  well theres reservoir chronicle
  reminds me of the huge golem thing rodos bro built in garo s2
  name and source
mineva banage here is the rx0 winged unicorn  a tool to create peace
or do you guys think banage followed the same route as this guy here
  by that you mean experience power only to give it up so easily
  by that you mean experience power only to give it up so easily  i mean being a cuck as the princess was going to marry another guy
  eggkun was too autist to give a shit about the princess unlike slaine
  if only uc2 wasnt in planning stages we would have an actual discussion    banagher will definitely need more firepower once the endgame for nt/uc2 happens

fer back from before ts announcement i was playing via psps psx emulator but probably because of that strange format final doesnt seem to be picking up fs save for import load and continue give blanks so im assuming the option would be attached to start if it were there i guess my best recourse is emulating via a pc base and trying to export the save to a pspreadable format
  if you can run ppsspp you probably shouldnt have a problem running mednafen for ps1 emulation
does gundam nt now mean that well get to use the black silver bullet sometime down the line because im aok with that    black silver bullet  unicorn unit 01
  i mean it was a cool but not quite cool enough to stop me from immediately thinking why didnt he just blow up their headquarters with the stingray and similar thoughts for other situations
t might have been a good game for him
  geist and van interactions   fuck i need it
  we have chirico hes close enough
  just wait for my fangame to be completed in the year 2045 and youll get it
  did gaiking and godannar do much in the game i cant recall
  gaiking starts at the episode where they get sent back to earth which is something like 80 of the way through its plot its story is confined to four stages one where you get kaikink one where you upgrade from kaikink to gaiking and get the daikumaryu and then two in a row where you get raiking vulking shinryu hydro blazer gaiking the great and beat proist three times in two stages    godannars relatively prominent though it features on a lot of routesplits and blade gainers one of the easier secrets
professor wolfgang and the main pilot of el dorado have the same va right wonder if theyll say something to each other
srw t is for trombe
so out of boredom i whipped up a new srw concept still havent gone too heavy on thinking how things fit together besides some of the more obvious ones but i think ive got a fairly interesting one potentially      1 mazinkaiser skl  2 getter robo hien the earth suicide  3 after war gundam x  4 new mobile report gundam wing glory of losers  5 new mobile report gundam wing endless waltz  6 new mobile report gundam wing dual story gunit  7 new mobile report gundam wing battlefield of pacifists  8 mobile suit crossbone gundam  9 mobile suit crossbone gundam skull heart  10 mobile suit crossbone gundam steel seven  11 dancouga burn  12 brain powerd  13 overman king gainer  14 hades project zeorymer  15 genesis of aquarion  16 shinkon gattai godannar  17 the seiten wars flieder bug  18 the big o  19 rebuild of evangelion  20 martian successor nadesico  21 kissdum r engage planet  22 cybernetics guardian  23 majestic prince  24 captain earth    series debut  111  222 plot only 333 is unit only
  no ttgl no hope
  you think wolfgang and gang will be playable outside dlc this time
  this time i have a gut feeling both they and perhaps one or two other might gaine villains will join the team
reminder to slay all greenhaired idorus on sight
  do you prefer to make series lists first or making a story and making things fit around it
what if every single srw was translated into english but the translations were all crabsticktier
  then wed be living in the age of fatso
  depends on the list although both are important in my opinion to making a good concept
are you invincible are you a super robot
  no im a real robot
  you just got ttgl last game you ungrateful fuck
  spiral junkies never get enough and thats what makes them such a nuisance i wish we could get rid of them
  cant be z master theyve got to deal with zonuda
  what the fuck did you say about us spiral junkies you plebeian
  get outta here with those weaksauce discount getter rays boy universal stagnation is the way to go for all the cool kids
  where did you got that
steel 7 plot is so good they ignore it every single time its in srw amirite
  yes
  devil axis
ranga when he deserves a chance too
  one day anon one day
  remainder that krutes was voiced by ishizuka and this game was our last chance of getting the series with his voice
  i too enjoy three sisters story
dead general
  srw gc translation is alive  really its alive
  dead game    dead everything
  yeh
  dead franchise
      its surprising how much conversation dies down after all the new game speculation is over
  only so much to speculate on before we get another pv
this is your og enemy mook    say something nice about it
  it is similarlooking to the ones we had in v and the og faction in that was largely inoffensive
does anyone have that gif saved of ushio and yuhi laughing i need it again
  reminds me of the golems in x
  in fact in v they were hardly there at all
  im more interested in whos in the gespenst
remember that super touhou wars game well the dev is making a compilation of the 4 ganes in one disk    and pretty sure it will have sone extras
  no one it has its own bravesstyle ai
its really weird that they didnt get the first harlock series for t since its theme of humanitys decay fits better than ssxs ayylmaos conquered earth would it have been that hard to switch it out once they had a game theme set ssx harlocks va is even the same as for space pirate captain harlock
  it took this long for the complete box  still no ex  tfw the translations will forever been unfinished past the first game
  haken browning
  ex should come out this year  if not then ex is dead just like alpha
  gc is alive
  makes his oc final boss a baku  thinks himself hot shit  on the same comiket he released the final game zun releases touhou 15 demo featuring doremy the baku  dev must have busted a blood vein
  endless frontier director left  haken will forever be trapped in og  this is bullshit haken must return to the paradise that is the endless tits and to his waifu
  i am sure he will be back for project x zone 3
  the director of endless frontier was the pxz director too
  hell come back to his home    someday maybe
  after z3 i was pretty thankful for that
  considering that harlocks fighting a jovian robot im guessing they wont even use ssxs plot
would she make a good wife and mother
  apparently they considered the original but they choose arcadia because the arcadia itself is the most iconic ship in the franchise
  reminds me of the balmarians in alpha 3
  just bring everyone to ogverse i want my belly dancing in og game by that i mean give suzuka a mech that can simulate bellydance too
i fucking hate how since z they always end dynamic attacks back at the empty background    ux and bx and alpha managed to avoid that by immediately closing the attack on the dynamic shot itself i dunno why z onwards didnt have this
  fuck you endless frontier  og verse
teradasan wanted to put in the first space pirate captain harlock anime adaptation from 1978 while mogamisan wanted to put in arcadia of my youth after arguing they ended up picking arcadia of my youth endless orbit ssx for multiple reasons in the first anime captain harlocks ship the arcadia is colored blue however its green in arcadia of my youths movie and tv series teradasan really wanted to put in the blue one since its the original design but in the end they decided on the green one because more people are accustomed to it the arcadia seen in galaxy express 999 is green too
  godannars finale in l happened in the midgame during a route split which was weird but it meant you got all the final units and upgrades pretty early
  alright ill check it out appreciate the input
  she would make a dead wife and mother
  hybrid creature composed of invader zondar stmc evil aura dg cell and mycane parts
how do you make votoms units not boring  i benched every single one of them in all z games even chirico because theres just that many characters that can outclass them
  wife sure mother kids gonna grow up with some mommy issues probably like that kid in gto with the hot mom
  max thr scopedogs hp but only upgrade armor a little like a miniature ideon coast on prevail 9  abnormal survivor until rng says fuck it
  use chirico   rinse and repeat     profit
  shes gonna have twin girls though
  kyosuke doesnt care about her flirting around and generally being a tease because he knows shed never go further than that but as for the mother part those kids are going to get confused seeing mom constantly sexually harassing uncle bullet and the men itll probably get worse as she gets older too as shell eventually go full /ss/ with new and younger pilots
  how about use literally anyone with a postmove map in z3 rinse and repeat
  not dead enough sadly
  the general will never be kill matt you know this it is the weight you must carry
  the sins of my crimes against man weigh heavily on my back
    im surprised it took this long for someone to read the thread title no sorry im just trolling you
  spoilers theyre actually my kids
  i still talk with steve if gc had restarted i would have known i figured someone was salting my wounds further
so ill just admit it sometimes i use pixel galaxy for info please dont skin me /m/
    her tits why are they so milky
  she just needs someone to pump them
  you have betrayed my trust i am unsure if i will ever smile again
  nigga ef is the ogverse
  wonder if this means theyll be remaking fmw1  2 too
  it wouldnt be complete if they didnt personally im hoping for something that could support a full translation patch as the first one was my introduction to srwstyle gameplay
game has akito and sai saici  van ruins all their food with endless condiments  what other lame jokes are we going to have
  translation for the first 3 games have been available for a long time even the last game has a almost complete one      nobody can stop daikumaryu smugsheep
  first harlock was originally considered but endless orbit ssx was chosen instead because the green arcadia is more iconic than the original blue version
  neo ranga in srw when itd be nice to see the hotblooded cops reaction to the other robots
soul
  thats a lie theyre mine
soulless
    original is soulless  thats not how it works
  how many waifus does one man need
  harlocks probably going to have soul in this game
  everyone gets soul nowadays
when is bullet finally going to get fed up and rape her for all the teasing she puts him through
  cant rape the dead
  baku girl is weak  
  are you saying there is a limit to how much hope we should have
  less than what used to but okita and nemo had it so harlock will
  i dont think bullet is into necrophilia
  im guessing they couldnt just get the licenses for both and do the originals plot with the more iconic version of the ship
  damn is this what a good srw game is supposed to look like
  even more than what that pic implies anon the waifu count is everincreasing
  well judge its final boss  
srw where kamina lives when if seems the condition they put to branpresto to use ttgl was that kittan and only kittan always dies so there is not reason why kamina cant live
    is she really dead since when ive been out of the loop for a while now
  pretimeskip gurren lagann is not happening again my dude
  her voice actor is dead      who said something about pretimeskip
  her voice actor is dead  oh i knew that i thought people were saying the actual character died
  kamina came back in srw z32 briefly
  ttgl where kamina survives would require rewriting like 3/4 of the show and so theyd have to take it from the top if they were going to do it    they dont even do pod where gai survived and gai is way less important than kamina was
kamina and kittan will always die in your lifetime
  they dont even do pod where gai survived  anon  
  nope but i dont think branpresto will dare to recast her
  yeah that proves my point w had tv nadesico too gai never survived where pod has been by itself
  the point is that they made gai survived at all
  you shut your whore mouth
  no more cutest and best version of yoko  it hurts
theyll always only do gurren lagann the movie the lights in the sky are stars in srw just like gundam 00 movie a wakening of the trailblazer is the only thing adapted these days
  yeah well if kamina is going to survive that probably means were going to have to do pretimeskip unless he just shows up at the end having miraculously been alive for 7 years with no one knowing about it i dont think anyone wants that     pretimeskip is probably not happening because that would require a whole lot more assets than are in hd for something that your average gurren laganntard that only cares about muh galaxy shurikens will be bored by
    i like both though the blue one is more familiar to me since i started with the first series and i also prefer the color blue
  its also a lot weaker than it used to be though
i have this gripping urge to rewatch expelled from paradise until im sure what the original arhans attack list is going to be i feel worried over how obsessed i am help me /m/
  i have this gripping urge to rewatch expelled from paradise until im sure what the original arhans attack list is going to be  straight rapid fire jump and rapid fire from above thats it those are its two attacks
  it could have a map attack
  ok it gets a map version of jump and rapid fire from above but it has the same animation
doesnt it have missiles and stuff in the final battle
  machine guns  aerial version of said machine guns  dingo rifle support    perhaps theyd incorporate the sword into its default weapon set considering the ones ran by hayashibaras takayamas and mitsuishis characters had them as part of the originals set    as for the upgraded theyd probably have a couple of frontier setters drones pop in
will we get more playable villains from zeta and zz in t chara soon seems like the obvious choice from zz but who havent we had from zeta gates capa
  recoa jerids girlfriend four and rosamie maybe scirocco himself if they want to get crazy
  has scirroco even had any strong feelings about jupiter being turned into a bomb when zeta has been in the same games as gunbuster
  reccoa  traitorous bastards deserve to die
what is with these games lately only having the minor villains but never scirocco and haman
  hes been dead when they kill jupiter iirc
just wait until we get the new lancelot and guren in srw
  theres a masturbation joke in here somewhere
  the fuck did they do to guren
  said joke was the entire basis for a crappy show called daimidaler
  is lancelot a matador now  these seems silly
  that looks awful
  i kinda dig the big hand its the regular hand that looks worse now
you are the
  zogilia no teki
  gridman
  uchuu space number one
    wonder if this thing is still in they just showed off a figure of it a month ago and since these are getting figures too i would assume these were already well into development when they put that up for display    so then can we assume this will be for lelouchto use too
  honestly saving reccoa and sara in z was really frustrating because they dont learn any lesson at all they openly hate you for killing scirocco and only join you because they have nowhere else to go theyre not even useful that late in the game neither are the units they bring so you might as well put them out of their misery in the mission and collect the experience and money
  im glad buddy complex is out hell come to think of it im pretty sure its the reason we got alwarth to begin with travelling between multiple alternate worlds and laying bcs time travel on top of it would be too much of a clusterfuck for one game
  nah the only reason for alwrath was wataru
  wataru would be isekai one way or the other could have been merged with byston well if they wanted it to alwarth was done so we didnt have to visit a dozen different worlds with conflicting lore and also time travel between them sometimes
siiiiip domon
  alwarth was done so we didnt have to visit a dozen different worlds with conflicting lore and also time travel between them sometimes  the bc time travel barely played a part and was only related to embryo if anything it was them being lazy and not wanting to think of a way to set all shows in the same world like they used to v already had that issue
    there it is thanks man
  theyre not even useful that late in the game neither are the units they bring  neither unit is bad in space and sarah gets wish reccoa is squad filler at best
  if anything it was them being lazy and not wanting to think of a way to set all shows in the same world like they used to  but thats exactly what alwarth did everything all happened in alwarth its not in the same sense that youre talking about but thats more the postplot problem at work it wouldnt even matter if most of these series took place in a world that tried to combine all their lore since most of the series were already over by the time x began
  siiiiip shisshou
  fuck off satan
  why i bring you a splendid gift
  those numbers this must be the work of the devil gundam with the help of kyoooooooooooojiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
  those double dubsim positive this guy how acquired abilities of the bateman gundam with the help of kyooooojiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
  huh i didnt even notice i wasnt even trying to get them
  now this is silly
  i have been having very silly luck lately though it really goes both ways as well i saw this happen last night in ogs
devil gundam    into the trash it goes
  has buran ever been recruitable
t is the perfect chance for the return of devil axis not gonna happen though
  of course after all modern srw is too afraid to go balls to the walls anymore
    get off my lawn
  would the claw pilot it
  haman pls
  it was in ap      yes gun x sword cca and g gundam will share finals
  but ap didnt have devil axis anon    devil gundam took over the giant colony from dragonar
  youre dead when that happens fuck off
  just saying in t there is no reason why devil gundam wont combine with some big space thing
  they could have made him join you in v since he somehow lucked out and survived the events of zeta in that just like jerid but they didnt
so what brave do you guys hope will have the honor to fight alongside might gaine in next srw game after t
  there is no reason why devil gundam wont combine with some big space thing  effort is a good enough reason
gaine wont even be in srw it will take a break like cross ange while final ggg hd assets will definitely be in the next game for reuse until you like it
  i want fighbird just for the theme barring that exkaiser cause it sounds cool    before mightgaine and ggg though id never experienced any braves aside from how src dungeon represented them sounds like the maker is included series from t in his next update as well as extending the range of og characters represented
  just saying in t there is no reason why devil gundam wont combine with some big space thing  the satellite from expelled from paradise
  fighbird  jk goldran
dendoh
xabunguru
  but then frontier settler cant leave the solar system
  yurusanzo dendoh
  never ever again
  da garn fighbird and if possible dagwon
  wasnt ap devil mass driver
make this an attack thnx
  that was mx
  devil pillar of cephiro  devil autozam the whole nation of autozam  devil buster machine 3  z master with dg cells  debonair with dg cells
so as an aside outside maybe adding the characters and their plot is outside the planes at all times unlike vicious who does pilot and is pretty good at it the only reason cowboy bebops movie would ever get in srw is because they want to use the military jets from it    in case it ever gets into a future game you know      fucking please neo had the devil gundam combine with something odd fucking neo the game that couldnt bother to put effort into literally anything at all much less g gundam    t will have it combine with something but whether thatll be visible in the sprite or just as a part of the map as usual is a question that remains unsolved
im sorry for the newfag post but i just learned that srw t will have an english option  to what extent is that is it literally all text or just some parts of it i didnt know srw games had an english option until now and im probably going to buy a switch for this and smash
  fully translated theyve recently started releasing these english translated versions in the english speaking parts of asia in order to get around american and european copyrights
  srw v x and moon dwellers had official english versions all the text is translated    the translation for moon dwellers is pretty mediocre but the other two are good
  everything except for voices will be in english  better question is whats not in english
  starting with md with a questionable quality admittedly srw games have been getting full english subs translating the dialogue menus galleries and etc mds quality made things suspect but v and x had quite acceptable translations which hopefully t will continue
  since moon dwellers all console srws had fullenglish text localization made for the southeast asian market winkwink and that includes v x and t md text is a somewhat sloppy start but everything after that is solid
dd isnt in english and that looks to be a normal srw game
  mobile game runs on different rules
  it looks like it plays like a regular srw but its still a gacha game and mobile only
  that looks to be a normal srw game  you wish its gacha crap if they released proper games like t on mobile id actually buy them
  they did some time back actually and youve probably never heard of them
  not devil birthday operated by claw
  ayyo hol up
  but what about  zondarized devil gundam
  watch as there is some plot magic that make it so zonder metal and dg cells cant mix    like how the zonders could not use their metal things on tekkamen
  oh thats easy the zondar cores themselves dont work on machines only living beings if they used dg cells to make their bodies in the way they usually work on machinery youd just end up with zondars at that point possibly with better regen but nothing otherwise different
  didnt all the zonders in w have a barrier or am i thinking of the primevils
we dont know what the game is like until it comes out    but if it looks like an srw then its a srw unless the gameplay said otherwise which we wont know until the game is out      so does neo that game has different rules       it looks like it plays like a regular srw  therefore its a mobile game    if they did a remaster of srw j for mobile it still is a srw game
  but dont the zondar take over units from all factions in w and the alphas wouldnt it be possible for zondar metal to infect the devil gundam then
          thank you i didnt know all of this  just two more questions any idea if there will be any differences between the switch and ps4 versions maybe based on a previous multiplat srw  and any idea on release cost with shipping
  we have no idea because of sony
  any idea if there will be any differences between the switch and ps4 versions maybe based on a previous multiplat srw  the only difference that would come to mind is that the ps4 version has trophies while the switch does not    other than that there has never been differences in srw games that have a multiplatform release
  shouldnt be version differences costs like a standard full game but shippings going to be disappointing compared to going to the local store
    zonderized emeraude
  we were never discussing over if it was or not an srw but to why it wasnt announced in english like the other ones with the reason most likely being the fact that its a mobile game
  by that lgic if they announced srw y for the xbox one and there is no annocment of it coming out in english    and someone gave the reason because its the one the xbox one    i think its safe to say that is not a good reason
  zonderized vicious
  its just fan art 
  now i want dd just because i see those getter dragons on that map
  how about black noir fused with zondar and dg cell tech
i fucked up with getting rockpie and forget to deploy ringo   oh well
  i had to restart the stage because of that a week ago 
  i dont care much for rockpie but theres a part of me that wont let it go
  i want the ones from brave saga to see the light of day again  baan gaan and victorion
  zondars have a barrier stock thats why melting siren was a thing they invented though gaogaigar itself has a way around the barrier in general      yes but theyd just be zondars at that point its not like a zondar that possesses a death army mook would get any powers special or anything    does the death army even have anything the zondars dont do naturally
  lol they even brought it up in og 2
x3 when  
  i wonder how t will do getter robo    i see it being posttime skip     armageddon happen during the one year war ryoma is friends with lily amuro and lily kouji    invaders are big problem 40 of the reason why humans cant leave the solar system    and jupiter
  invaders are big problem 40 of the reason why humans cant leave the solar system  and jupiter    and you know the horrifying space monsters that start at like 30 meters and swiftly get into the 500 meter range and kill everything they see i imagine
  well since we saw the saotome labs in the trailer it may just end up pretimeskip this time hopefully    if anything pretimeskip may be the only plot we get from armageddon weirdly since it has way too much competition for the epic space finale this time i dont think there will be any room to squeeze stinger  cohen in if we have to finish off the z master the devil colony and the gunbuster space monsters all in one game
  the horrifying space monsters that start at like 30 meters and swiftly get into the 500 meter range and kill everything they see i imagine    just like mecha    makes you think
  cant wait to see how they try to skirt around how ridiculously huge and overpowered gunbuster is    were not gonna get it until very late in the game are we
  if anything pretimeskip may be the only plot we get from armageddon weirdly since it has way too much competition for the epic space finale this time i dont think there will be any room to squeeze stinger  cohen in if we have to finish off the z master the devil colony and the gunbuster space monsters all in one game    you arent trying nearly hard enough anon stinger and cohen barely require any effort to add into the plot and the invaders are classic stage filler enemies
  gunbuster will only be in the last 10 stages    screencap this
  maybe if they combine gunbuster and armageddon plot did that happen in the z games
whos the sailor moon of srw    and no nobel gundam doesnt count
  im so glad this meme has lived on      im sorry anon use those tears to focus on bettering yourself and learning to read moon runes      uchu space brank in space
  valsione
do people actually like squad systems  it just adds an annoying micromanaging element to the game especially with 3 unit squads
  2man squad is the perfect balance
  i like that i could field even the most obscure character/mech
  i like it not only so i dont have to bench half the cast but also cause it adds some level of fake interaction between characters if that makes sense you can pair the characters you like and even if they barely interact in the story pretend they are now best buds that fight together like the poor mans version of an original combo attack fuck now i want fire emblem style conversations between paired characters would be like a better version of the ace interviews we get now
  same i sent the two along with scirocco to the afterlife which is hopefully hell
  i certainly enjoyed pairing shinn and setsuko in z32 is he the only nonog character who has a doujin with an og girl shinji only has that one kallenxaoi one
  that excellen chick raped all the boys in the doujins
  but shinn is only 16  while setsuko is over 20
i cant wait for mokona to eat all the faeries
what are the odds they somehow tie the brain scratch episode of cowboy bebop together with expelled from paradise in some way in t
eyh new player here im playing og 1 on gba and i have a question about terrain how does a unit qualify as being on water or in the air  there seems to be no flying attribute so i dont understand how the game tells the different between say the cybird and a gespenst mk ii m crossing the same water tile is every unit on a water tile considered in the water  are there going to be air tiles later  im a bit confused pls help
  there seems to be no flying attribute  there is though the cybird is flying over water i guess it cant land but transform into cybuster and you should get the option to land which will make you dive if youre over water it shouldnt be hard to tell the difference
  and
  setsuko is too old for shinn
  i think i understand flying units leave a shadow projected on their tile when theyre flying weir that its not listed in their status thanks
will we fight chirico for a stage again i wonder
  and ypsilon be saveble
  random tip when you get an aqua jet put it on rais schutzwald hell carry your ass through the early water levels with that since it also gives his beam weapons a decent rank in water tiles
  isnt his beam weapon unusable on water tiles  its always red when i try to use it from water  this is before moving btw
  rais beam cannons cant fire if you move if it has a p after it then those are the only attacks you can use postmovement
  wait i read that wrong im an idiot
  parts that boost terrain ranks also boost weapons even beam weapons become usable in water with an aqua jet
why is there an iczer in rayearth
  both were directed by hirano
  because everybody wants to rape iczer even mahou shoujo
  its only four years
  it lets you deploy more of the cast instead of having to bench 3/4ths of them even in the smaller rosters of the recent ps4/vita games and provides a small amount more to think about than just upgrade mc units and throw them at the front lines  the ds/3ds games pair system and ogs twin system are both fine wasnt a huge fan of z3s tag bullshit though  i think tri squads couldve been really interesting if they ever iterated on it to work out some of the kinks center being basically useless unless on anything besides shadow angels unless you wanted your squadmates to die for example but theyre never gonna put in the effort for that many squad fodder units again
so when are we gonna know the release date for t pv2
whats the best way to grind kills to get ryofu tallgeese in ux
  you can do it any missions with endlessly respawning enemies or you can do the game over grind  shadow over innsmouth is a popular pick because the destroyer robos arent too strong you have all 3 rottk gundams by that point and its easy to get a game over by siccing the ptolemaios or elshank into claudius and caligula
  because the destroyer robos arent too strong    and because dagon doesnt move and i dont think claudius or caligula do until you provoke them so you can take as much time as needed
  itll probably be second quarter for t
  i guess theres probably going to be a special preorder version that hasnt been announced yet right im not preordering yet in any case
  i like z3 tag partner better because it encourages using 2ndtier units lucas vf is fucking useful for once
  wouldnt it be possible for zondar metal to infect the devil gundam then    and vice versa dg cells taking over the zonder metal  both would be at a balanced imbalance kind of stalemate and presumably cancel out each others effect to the point where both parties would conclude fuck this lets infect something we can actually use
  the problem with tag was with tag tension more than the regular partner stuff
  how in the world would dg cells take over a zondar though    like until rain became the core their rate of expansion was fucking pitiful i could maybe see it after that but dg cells are barely sentient while zondars are arguably sapient and at least a few of their 31 masters are fully sophont from what weve seen and they take over machines quickly
  yeah i enjoy them since it means i can use the side characters  otherwise with regular games i just use the mc from each show and maybe one of the side characters who are good
  im pretty sure itll be march/april release again considering their schedule for the last several years we just dont get a date yet because they announced t early this time i hope im wrong though
running rpcs3  get srw tengoku hen  realized it runs really well  until there is no custom bgm
  i fucking love triattacks  too bad it will never happen again
  now you have an excuse to not field those without new bgm
  youre on a damn computer just turn song volume to 0 and play whatever music you want in the background
  ogs 2 running on rpcs3 when
  tri attacks were pretty fun to use
i really wish we could get ideon in a srw game again i want an srw were the power level is just so batshit insane that ideons galaxy cleansing bullshit canon seems balanced
    
  at least with ideon when they go oh my this attack is far too powerful to ever use we should seal it they have a good reason
is it better to go for the grungust or the r1 in alpha gaiden
  you get the r1 no matter what and the robot you get for ryusei early on gets discarded when you do  also gespenst is objectively the coolest of the three so pick that unless youre an idiot
    can gunbusters be grunts
i just realised an easy way to justify putting the bebop in as a playable unit    just give it repair and/or resupply and go naked it doesnt matter if it has no attacks the ptolemaios in hakaihen had no attacks and was fine as just a repair battleship they can do it again no problem
  na    sizzlers are actually better than gunbuster in all but an extremely small number of corner cases
  ideon would have fit into the deep space madness in tengokuhen with you fighting tons of invaders and gargantia enemies
  ptolemaios did get attacks it just only unlocked them halfway into the game
  couldnt they have jet or someone shoot something garancieres literally had no weapons but it has a summon attack
  sizzler is a steakhouse matt theres no robot called sizzler it doesnt exist just a figment of your imagination
  steakhouse  what does an stmc taste like when grilled
  filterbait as usual
  they could have jets ship as the attacks ed would also be on it as a spirit bank
undefeated of the east  there is no east in space    defend this
  to be fair by the time asia would have reached space in terms of being undefeated he would be super asia not master asia
maybe
  speaking of asia    three body problem in srw when
updated pic related to go up to 2019 let me know if i missed anything
  he is already defeated so who cares
  jinraiger  eventually being made   let it go anon
  anyone think we can pretty much wipe off all the early 70s series from ever debuting or returning unless they get all new vas to replace those who had either died or retired
srw x does get confusing at times with buddy complex/greco with their oblivious darkhaired mcs and batshit insane short whitehaired rivals with cute sidekicks
  you missed g reco in 2014
  exkaiser  tiramisu  might as well color them as they are confirmed for xo
  heybot began airing in 2016 mistake holdover from the previous list
  i thought it started in 2017 for some reason
    wasnt laserion in xo as well      at this point if something from before the year 1990 hasnt debuted yet its pretty safe to assume its a never ever
  pretty safe to assume its an xo candidate    fixed there for as long as that game manages to chug along we might see something once it dies then anything not having debuted in it is a true never ever
  how long has it been since they announced it
  it was originally supposed to air in 2016
  you missed rayearth and gasaraki being in srw as well time to sudoku
  different anon
  oh shit thanks anon
  sd gundam force when
  yes laserion is there too  i guess theres also all that stuff that isnt anime or arent exactly of the mecha genre either like devilman  while we are at it cutie honey universe was in xo as well
  devilmans manga is what got in and that list was always about animated works not manga or live action stuff thus why crossbone mazingers manga manga linebarrel and the sentai arent on that list amongst others
  then why is gsavior there
updated once more
  at this point if something from before the year 1990 hasnt debuted yet its pretty safe to assume its a never ever  we got wataru last year and harlock now its rare but it happens
  sheesh even with all the stuff thats been featured in srw across the years i forget just how prevalent the genre has been across the decades even when counting the really tangential stuff
  one more thing  holy beast machine psygod is a horrific mangling of cyguard the japanese title of cybernetics guardian which is listed just a few spaces below that anyway might want to remove that
  whatever you say fampai
  you forgot dougram and robot girls z
  alright this should be the last one i think
  oh did dougram make it into xo after all mustve missed it    i dont really want it in the main series because itll just make me disappointed over how lame the combat armors are in comparison to things like the razangriff raven
  fuck now i want fire emblem style conversations between paired characters  and then fe style romance  and then fe style children  and then fe style create your own character mc  and then srw is just fe with mechs
  we already have support attack/defend quotes its already happening anon embrace the waifus
  i want to make childrenfromthefuture with my srw waifu
  probably was added before i got ahold of the list some years back and i didnt catch and remove it it really shouldnt be though      a while back yeah they did a poll as to what series people wanted to see over in japan dougram and lgaim did really well apparently
  why has it been so long since lgaim has been in anything other mobage and trash 3d games anyway
  your guess is as good as mine
    is this guy mattman if this guy comes to these threads can i request ancient giants and those magic demon guys from lord of the elemental final coffin of the end getting all attack videos
  why would you ask that are you an akurasu editor or the owner of pixel galaxy by any chance
  no different guy ive got the same name on youtube    i would imagine that before getting to cote hes going to do the rest of the mks to quote his channel    upcoming srw attack exhibition     super robot wars og saga masou kishin series   super robot wars bx nintendo 3ds   super robot wars 64 nintendo 64   the 2nd super robot wars og playstation 3
  maybe    alright thanks mattman
  same i hope they pilot good shit
  theyll pilot lions and youll like it
  playable barrelions  about time
  who would you marry off to boss
  didnt fe always have you as an actual character its just that early games had you as a faceless tactician sort rather than a battle participant
  fa
  that was only one game fe7 to be exact
  t version of this then    
  fe12 was the first to have yourself as a playable character ine fe7 you had the option to be a faceless mute npc whom some characters talk to during certain story scenes other than that there were no player characters in the older games
  i remember a few days ago someone posted a link summarizing last mondays stream and the link claimed that terada said that most of the voiced lines in t are new    i almost burst out laughing at that
  wipe off all the early 70s series from ever returning  unless they get all new vas  stop this meme any series that has been used in a game with voices in past can easily be reused with the same recordings daitarn 3 was in x twelve years after hirotaka suzuokis death using voice samples recorded in the 90s obviously this limits the potential for voiced crossover interactions but thats not required and its not like they even do a lot of that in the first place in fact they do it very little  the primary reason theyve been using more modern versions of mazinger and getter recently is probably just that they want to use stuff thats fresher in peoples minds and invokes real nostalgia in a larger section of the audience the stuff from the 70s is now so old that even people in their 30s are unlikely to have seen it
  that they want to use stuff thats fresher in peoples minds and invokes real nostalgia in a larger section of the audience    well for one thing armageddon is the oldest getter ova  and for another why dont they do this with uc gundam the closest they get is using cca instead of 0079 the origin has been out for a while now
question about x if i start a playtrhough in hard and then lower it to normal does it fuck with the sr points i started my second playtrhough but find the game to actually be more fun with the actual sr conditions than just stronger enemies
                    coffin of the end stuff already on youtube
so ive just though of something as i was playing l in l they give you one of seed destinys black tristars with a summon attack for the other two i was wondering if instead of mazingirls being a summon attack for boss they might give you one of them in a venus with a summon attack for the team just so well have a mazinger fembot in one of the previous threads somebody said that in a tie in novel/the novelization they got a backstory and characterization as kids kouji saved in an attack or something so presumably that thing would of had to give them names    yeah i know wishful thinking theyll probably just be the new kurogane house for infinity borot
  well for one thing armageddon is the oldest getter ova  its still more than 20 years newer than the tv series also all the ovas happened in a span of six years which is not that much it makes sense to prioritize the most popular one    and for another why dont they do this with uc gundam  probably because the anime version has only been prequel shit so far maybe theyre waiting to see if its gonna get a full adaptation
  its still more than 20 years newer than the tv series  except for getter go which has only been in xo  not that anyone seems to remember it    maybe theyre waiting to see if its gonna get a full adaptation   didnt stop them with fmp bizarre that it would stop them with gundam
  
didnt stop them with fmp bizarre that it would stop them with gundam  gundam is special havent you noticed
hey does anyone know why the text is looking like this in ux im using the latest build of citra nightly
  maybe the language pack is messed up
  expert mode sort of    expert mode just requires you to complete the stage in one go the game over  lose the sr point still applies iirc while standard requires you to complete the sr point reqs    going from one to the other doesnt affect anything aside from maybe enemy upgrades and having to actually complete the sr reqs id have to double check on the former to make sure
  yeah that what worried me was if going from expert to standard would somehow lost me the points of stages i cleared on expert
  i dont think you lose the points youve already gotten those are still counted as far as im aware    its just a toggle in the options in the intermission anyway so you could jump back and forth easily
  how would i put a new language pack if thats the case
  you missed lost universe in 1998
  to love hikaru tenderly
so the yamato got shitloads of attacks and an ideon gun tier finisher a good number of enemy types and was on the whole busted as fuck    the nautilus got fuck all attacks or progression beyond unlocking the ram but was still solid    ive forgotten harlock so whats likely for the arcadia    im guessing    machine guns  missiles  missile map  cannons  fire all weapons    then probably unlock    some kind of assist attack with fighters  fire even more cannons with a dramatic cutin    does it have any signature weapons or combat sequences they can turn into moves
  i actually hope they work in mad pierrot into the game by zonderizing him or giving him dg cells or god forbid both
might have more luck posting this here    whats this guys name anyone know why was he chosen for t instead of someone like garuda/doublas/actually relevant
  im still upset that they dont even let you use the wmc for the final stage    at least it got a pretty good p attack in return
  the nautilus got fuck all attacks or progression beyond unlocking the ram but was still solid    it also unlocked the barrier    the reason the neo nautilus unlocked so little is that it had fuckall for attacks in the show which is still more than the nautilus mind but still
  probably just for variety    were probably getting doublas and garada anyway theyre too iconic not to be in plus i dont think theyve missed a game that had z plot of some form in it    technically shins later appearances i guess but they gave us garadoubla in those cases
  more ramming action
  it was mentioned in a previous thread  your shared font file is outdated so citras defaulting to open source ones youll either need to dump fresh fonts from a 3ds find someone to do it to you or find an older citra version compatible with your file
  im still upset that they dont even let you use the wmc for the final stage  but they do did you not get the true ending
  
  i recently replayed to get the bad ending forgot about the true ending
  they do on the secret route actually one of the reqs for that is using it while it is available on the one stage you can use it on
  speaking of doublas will we ever get rgz in a non mobile game i want to bully doublaschan and she would be guaranteed to be a secret
  dr hell used it as a sort of mp grunt in the movie its not based on any old mazinger z beast as far as i know but they lead frontlines and fill crowd shots a lot with varying weapons      depending on how you count the skl mooks bx only has those instead of the actual garuda and doublas though doublas gets a map sprite once
  brave police judecca
i miss heero always reentering the atmosphere to fire the tbr
  hows ps3 emulation these days  might fuck around with it to replay z3
  that would require a whole lot more assets than are in hd for something that your average gurren laganntard that only cares about muh galaxy shurikens will be bored by    you and i both know that bb studio wouldnt make those assets regardless of what the fanbase wanted itd require too much work for them
  i believe the nautilus crew mentioned that the new ship had more weapons and utility but they couldnt get everything operational with so little time wonder if some of those could be realized in srw if anno feels like sharing the concepts
  oh cross ange really was the best mecha show of the year
  nah that was majin bone
  confirmed for being made jinraiger    anon i
  i had high hopes for jinraiger well not too high since character design wise it was looking like braiger skl but i thought it could be fun and possibly lead to more j9 appearances in srw alas it fell into development hell
  also it was water margin with a giant robot and thats cool as fuck
what was the last game that had prologue stages for something else that just introduce the og i just finished and the first season of rayearth and think having the finale with zagato and emeraude as a prologue and then the game proper covering the second season could work as there was no mecha action before that
  srw x oh wait that game would be so much better with a prologue    z22 had a prologue
  i believe that would be ux  you know rayearth being in srw for real finally got me remembering an srw fanfic i read once it also had the final of season one as a prologue stage but had a crossover element where because zagato was winning esmaraude summoned coincidentally enough with t gaogaigar to help the girls    also this fanfic had fuu attending ashford academy alongside kouji sayaka and the cast of kannzuki no miko i cant remember anything else about it    as for what srw could do instead umi awoke her rune god at episode 10 and fuu awoke hers in 15 maybe they could say because of zagato getting outside help of the giant robot kind selece and windam decide to let the girls use them early
  x did have a prologue its just optional and only introduces the mc    to answer s question z32 before that is technically oe then ux
oh yeah meant to ask  whens the next tokyo game show we got stage 2 of v and x in that albeit xs was modified to have dunbine instead of the still unrevealed xelguard and im curious
  next year tgs happens in september
  fuck wrong thing with same abbreviation taipei game show
  24 to 28 of january 2019
stage 2 preview for t  g gundam and gxs in the same stage  theyre postplot
  good to know      if you only see a unit from a series with no other units or characters from that series around and it seems to be focusing entirely on other plot keep in mind it will be something to replace the og with
  if the theme of the game is revenge im doubting rayearth will be what gets our plot going sounds more like were going to start with gxs and/or bebop
  the horde of mecha beasts had a bunch of generics thrown in im guessing those generics will be the weak robots you kill by the dozen while the named ones will retain their boss status like in shin mazinger    pretty much all of the main ones that do anything at all fought kouji before the final battle the rest only make hand drawn cameos when dr hell invades mt fuji    i hope some the hand drawn show up since they even had satan claus p10 in there
  casual gunbuster placeholder on stage 2
  theme is revenge the solar system and one more thing they didnt tell us
  t is for trauma  t is for terror  t is for trials and tribulations  t is for tomorrow
  its dead love interests  elena  julia  smiisssuu  eagle  fyana if they got that far  michiru  countless gundam characters  every member of dunbines main cast
    final theme is love confirmed
  t is for tragedy  t is for tears  t is for togetherness
i completely forgot how nice some of the greco mechs were kerbes deserves something nicer than a jegan
  it doesnt have to be the main plot some games had like 5 prologue stages just to set up some shows
  love was already the theme on v and kinda in x if you choose amari im sure we will get some with all the dead lovers and g gundam being there but hope its not the main theme with the final boss again
              honestly i wouldnt be surprised if they ended up revealing that dg cells are derived from zonder metal      similarly i have a feeling theyll link together invaders and stmc like how the alpha timeline connected the stmc with the angels      holy beast machine psygod is a horrific mangling of cyguard the japanese title of cybernetics guardian  itll never happen but cybernetics guardian would be amazing to see in srw    also someone needs to make a new thread already
  galilei donna in 2013 no surprise you missed it since its really obscure and bad
will we ever get kannazuki no miko in srw
  its an actual robot series so no
srw v announced to have hit over 500000 in sales winning the ps award gold prize and rivalling z1 510000 being higher than everything since then    for reference  z21 455000  z22 344000  z31 381000  z32 295000  ux 177000  bx 122000  og 2 293000  md 131000    still far from alpha series sales though  alpha 750000  alpha gaiden 580000  alpha 2 530000  alpha 3 644000
  still doesnt make it a good game
  why did alpha sell so good
  people used to buy video games
it was a different era free from mobile gacha kusoge    also page 10 now wheres the new thread
  when /srwg/ announces it faster than srw official  
  the creator for it just died a few days ago too
  is it because of the english version
  no this is japan only
  so if you add in the international sales it could possibly be up to something like 700 000
  so when you consider the chinese release and the sea release it probably sold more than z    srw is dying
  actually i think this includes overseas and digital with japan physical only being 200000
  ux 177000    but thats the best game why did ux do worst then z3
  no faggot        sony interactive entertainment japan asia has announced the winners of playstation awards 2018    red dead redemption 2 which would easily sell millions of copies is not on this list    its clearly japan only fuck off faggot
  wow rude
  ux  best
  the handheld spinoffs all sell worse than the main games  the fact ux sold almost 2/3 as many copies as z3 is honestly either really impressive for ux or kind of pathetic for tengoku
here we go new thread    
  retard
  wrong
  like moon dweller

  fate shitter  no taste  not surprised
  the epitome of the /m/an
  definitely not him
this qt
  she was bretty good
  best girl 
  isnt she lonis mother from unicorn
johnny ridden
  deserved better
  better acguy pilot
  this good boy right here  cried when he heard the news that dozle died
  fp is absolutely the bp  paternalistic genuinely helps amuro even though hes the enemy  looks out for his men doesnt even want to be there but keeps going for them  gets on with his job even when his allies sabotage him  keeps fighting even when all his mss are trashed  has a top tier lover  why cant we all be like lt ral
visch donahue
  the blue giant

  i love how pretty much every character in 0079 that isnt just a stock footage mook gets so much love even then some of the rank and file guys are immortalized if they say a funny line
/ourguy/ mashymre cello
  anavel gato
  dont know cos most of em died too early
i liked cpo manning from zeonic front but pictures of him are hard to come by
  here for you
  not in your heart anon
  i know there was one named mook from the tv series that went on to marry some hot zeek chick and pumped out a bunch of kids with her think it was in that gundam legacy mango
  fpbp
  a real man of zeon not like those others
  could you post the rest of the zeonic front cast
this guy right here    acted like the biggest faggot  got his whole team and most of kikis village killed    yolo life means taking as many faggots down with you godspeed arth
  gerhart is 35  jesus christ do he and ramba ral have some awful genes or something
  just seems to be a running stylistic issue/theme in japanese anime and manga i dont know maybe it speaks to some broader cultural issue where once you are out of high school in you might as well be ancient and have one foot in the grave or maybe japanese people just dont know how to realistically age characters with european features    realistically most people dont start looking like that until their late 40s or 50s
  its a combination of both to my knowledge thought it is getting better now
  war ages people bro look up pictures of 20 odd year olds in vietnam
  impeccable taste
    need more sophie  i never played the game is there a scene where she goes full blood lust demon like the wiki says or is that just put in there for filler and to explain why shes so strong in battle
  fluff bullshit from outside material the only people who have bullshit powers in game are amuro and char who basically make you miss them    shes strong in the game because she has a dom doms are fucking rape engines
  need more sophie  
  will never understand why they made him look like some dbz villain ffs hes like a human recoom
  zeon characters are not allowed to look pretty look at how a majority of them got hit by the ugly stick in 08th ms team and 0083
  it seems that his facial design was originally the one intended for kikis father but they decided to give it to norris after all
    also other designs proposed for norris consisted of something that looked even more like a dbz or street fighter character and a blatant copy of lord alberto from the giant robo ova im certain that whats written in the 8th team artbook explain their choices but i cant read nip sticks so i gonna take a wild guess and say that the final design for norris was chosen because it looked more german
  zeon male characters are not allowed to look pretty  fixed that for you
  this guy pilots the schuzrumgalluss its a suit with no backpack or ranged weaponry and he brings it int space either hes really ballsy or fucking stupid either way its a tie between him and bernie
  orochi doppo
  thatsa little disturbing
  its mostly the eyes and hair toriyama loves those weird mohawk kinda things
  really good game btw and its coming from someone who doesnt like sd ms
  that hamburger eating son of a bitch is a hero
  he also like hairless eyebrows
  thats true
  why
is ronin warriors /m/
theyre magical girls male
  you know that seems to be a more accurate description for them and for every saint seiya derivatives there is
oh okay so does it count as /m/
  no just like saint seiya or shurato    great show tho
what was his fucking problem
  why do people try to force it on this board though this is like the fourth samurai troopers thread ive seen on my time here and not once have i seen any saint seiya thread or any such clone here    is it all just toonamibabbies
  i remember they used to air it on network tv in america a long time before cartoon network ever aired it but yes probably
  well it did occupy the sunrise robot slot outside from it and ulysses 31 it has been robot shows nonstop from zambot 3 to gaogaigar when it aired because of saint seiya popularity and appeared somehow in crossover robot games franchises sunrise eiyuutan and brave saga but not super robot wars not yet at least at least they have more armor covering than ss bronze and iron saints
  i saw a saint seiya thread a little while back mainly it was arguing that it needed to be on /a/
  the first time i saw the show at all was when it was on the sci fi channel
stardust eyes and samurai heart are 10/10 ops
  yeah that had to be in 1994 or 95 i remember that too
which one do you think got to do the nasty with naste
  that time when a couple of the vas for the dub got sick and mia suddenly sounded like she was 40
  iirc it was on your local affiliate often a fox affil but not really tied to any particular national letter network
chirico is that you
ronin warriors is /m/ but saint seiya isnt
    you mean that you wouldnt be pissed off if someone stopped your from achieving your lifelong goals and locked you away for thousands of years then jacked your shit to part it out to a boy band
i noticed that any time people try to put this as a topic on /a/ it gets immediately buried by other topics that it gets shelved pretty quickly into deletion not archive immediate deletion if somebody would care to create a unique board about toku and sentai anime please do on the request board  by the way im not an admin im just someone who cares about the problem of how ronin warriors/samurai troopers rarely pop up in 4chan in general
  thats why ronin warriors is /m/ and saint seiya isnt
friendly reminder that its getting a blu ray release on december 5
  then explain why saint seiya isnt even talked about too much and disappears at the same rate as ronin warriors on /a/
  because theres no brazilians or frenchies on /a/ br and frogs come to /m/
  nice i hope it gets picked up for a domestic us release
  at least they have more armor covering than ss bronze and iron saints
  /a/ used to have a pre2000s anime thread going last time i was there for anyone that didnt want to watch seasonal bullshit    their fault for not posting there
  if youre going to do it do it right
  makes sense unfortunately its really weird that there is no solid american fanbase for saint seiya and frikkin brazil and france picked up and liked the series more than anyone probably even japan plus its been 30 years and theres not much love from ronin warriors/samurai troopers despite being nothing more than an underrated series i like the concept of ronin warriors ever since i saw the armor plus figures and wished for a distant sequel loosely based off of the oneshot sequel manga then expanded on with elements from the modern era
  inb4 saori is black with an afro shun is transexual and hyoga is a gay that escaped russian persecution
whats your /m/ guilty pleasure
everything
00 season 2
f91 the story a mass and you can feel a lot was cut from the film i still love it
edgy as fuck character designs ridiculous gonzo cg absurd premise cyborg zombie virus in futuristic germany turns 99 of people it infects into monsters but 1 into basically superheroes hilarious amounts of s u f f e r i n g motorcycles  this was the first anime i ever watched and i regret nothing
  this and pretty much any other 2000s /m/ anime
  sd gundam force and 00
i still love it
  fpbp fuck stop liking what i dont like faggots
  story a mass

  transam asspull i love the red color and afterimage
  eureka seven
  asspull or not its a great final middle finger from schenberg you hate my goals so much youd hack veda and kill me too bad heres a free upgrade for cb and i gave them plans to give everyone understanding whether they like it or not
goldion crusher and gggg
  are these obari humans i thought they had gone extinct after their bodies snapped like twigs
    i love obaris crazy anatomy it is all kinds of wonky but its wonky in that dynamic way shits larger than life and it just leaps out as pure insanity
  kannazuki no miko    everything about it except the mecha designs should make me hate it but somehow i i want more
gsavior
  it looks amazing on mecha on humans not so much someone post the wing boys by obari
    when hes allowed to go full super hero like gowcaizer its great
the little coatbot dude from senran kagura hes cute

  dont be mad     
  reconquista
seed destiny
after war gundam x
  why guilty greco was great
  the art and world design were the best but for me git laboratory was the worst arc
  maybe were just looking for different things because greco delivered in abundance everything i want out of a gundam show
pacific rim uprising just because i think the fights are better and longer i wanted to hate it because china pandering and boyega but i still left the theatre with a huge grin
fake gundam thread
  xaxaxa that is real gundam yes
  i was about to ask if huckebeins counted for the thread good taste
    i mean technically the titans made it as a successor or sister unit to the mark 2 didnt they
    cute
  around dracs  never relax
  man usagi yojimbo gets fucking weird
    yeah but its pretty great
  wait is this an actual thing
  the condoms are real and for sale the model is fan made
  that story arc is essential war of the worlds during feudal japan  still weirder things have happened in the real story
bros
  it kind of looks like a kkk mech
  tey even call it out about it in the show
  how come theres a lego zeong before a lego gundam
    i mean its not the only product like that
  lol wtf
    should have been called cum dams
  bruh i pulled this out of storage just the other day and threw him in the trash anyone got a pic of the other models you can assemble him into
  draconis steel folded 10000 times
    its so stupid that battletech had mechs that would randomly lack a hand when the design rules gave no benefit for their removal especially when punching when theres no hand incurred a penalty
  a lot of mechs had reasons to lack a hand or hands at least in the aesthetic sense the hatamoto chi was just weird though maybe theres some legend about a samurai that lost a hand or something
thunderbolt
  refined gundam zeta  not a gundam
  i want to live in a world where that is a mook machine
  could it even draw its own blades
  thats not from gundam
  throwing legos away  fuck you
  wait isnt that from that indie side scroller did they make a model kit of the main mech
  thats actually really cool
  kind of looks like a patlabor
  the hatamotochi is literally just a charger wearing a samurai costume its possible the lack of a left hand is a holdover from the original design that they were unable or unwilling to fix
product name  space gundam v
  that is actually kind of cool i could imagine better made versions of real fighters turning into battroids and gerwalks
    design this bad can only be southern cross in fact i bet its the robotech version the americans made and japs imported because no one in japan dared to make a model of designs this shitty  and yet it looks kinda cool
  cool fanfic  thats from japan from a group that did knockoff designs
  and even more
    that would probably explain the atat clone although it appears to be more heavily armed than the walker
  reminds me of something outta this stupid old movie about space wizards
  if they made girls frontline for mobile suits id be super down
bump
  gundam girls  random getter robo thrown in there
meanwhile in brazil
    srw continuity of the titans
  unless it was from the original games the titans had nothing to do with the original huckebein in alpha 1 they tried to steal the huckie mkii and they reassembled a bootleg mkiii in alpha 2 on arados route but they werent the original creators
  at least one charger model 1l had two hands considering all the other shit they did to make the hatamoto adding another hand would have been the least of their problems
  hasegawa
  the hatamotochi is literally just a charger  i dont know a lot about bt but isnt the charger one of the oldest designsn from the early star league era
bump
  thats largely the reason they did anything with it it bombed horribly when they tried to sell it during the league days they had like a thousand or so of the things rotting in storage then the succession wars caused so much damage to infrastructure that even shitty mechs had to be pulled out just to keep themselves armed see liao being so out of options they were reduced to using urbies as frontline mechs
  cuntam robo
  
patlabor
  tfw they will probably use this kind of design for the upcoming live action gundam movie
  i mean with sunrise involved probably not theyre probably gonna use a tweaked rx782
  where can you actually buy these    asking for a friend
  iirc they go back to the early 00s not sure how much theyre in circulation any more
    the charger is a bad mech it weighs 80 tons but has less firepower than a 20 ton mech most of the weight is in its oversized engine thanks to that engine it can go reasonably fast and try to use its large mass to overpower smaller mechs or act as a heavily armored scoutthats all it can do its that bad    the hatamotochi uses the same base chassis design but actually has real firepower it is superior
  can you survive 12 times  god damn this shit this shit got me it got me hard fampai
  thats actually official though famitsu bros magazine tiein      the keroro anime loved the gungal for some reason even though they didnt use its actual name    ironically they actually included a minidungal as they called it in the anime to avoid using the real name with one of keroros kits    this image here is the original version gungal
    here is the keroro one with goofier proportions but otherwise its essentially the same design
  fake gundam thread
  stay mad
  why would i be mad about spreading the gospel truth
  because its not the truth
  a gundam
  a gundam  bisson
  any actual argument or do you just like being a contrarian cunt
  upcoming live action gundam movie  what
  also american drama unicorn 2 after hathaway
  or canadian drama
  you never made an argument in the first place
  in mwo hand and lower arm actuators give a range of motion bonus to your arm movement    on omnimechs you can choose to remove them to free up slots which is sometimes necessary to take certain weapons since omnimechs have like 0 slots    removing the hand actuator will narrow your cone of arm twitch a significant amount removing the lower arm actuators completely removes your ability to aim laterally
  well shit    i mean if it looks like the rx78 did in rpo i wouldnt be too much against it but what are the chances of that
  that is one good looking design
  you never made an argument in the first place  is english by chance your third language  the question was do you have an actual argument or do you just like being a contrarian cunt whether someone has an argument or not is not the subject at matter here the question was do you have an argument but thats irrelevant now your answer was enough to conclude you just like being a contrarian cunt whether you wanted it or not you answered boy
  the hells this from
   no kidding
  what does it say
shitty gendum
filthy chink gundam
ditto
  2 two crossbone anime  why didnt you tell me any sooner
  man i cant wait for the fucking dark age cant wait to get the pew pew on in industrial work mechs
  speaking of which mortal engines is about to be released
  this threaad is still alive  jesus fucking christ
do you want to fug the bug
  dude real talk moths are cute     butterflies aint got shit on moths
i understand why it would be godzilla but why mothra and where did this new wave come from
  truth
  the absolute state of kaijuniggers
  poor harry
oh god this whole fug mothra thing is gonna explode once trailer 2 shows up is it
  mothra redesign sparks a wave of sexual desire to fug the bug also this post now we now what they really meant
too american i prefer the asian one that had a bit of thic and cute eyes
  that one was also cute now americans try and make her hot or something meh dont really mind but maybe she still dies at the end not jobbing or anything but dying to save godzilla i hope taking the bullet
    i like to think imagine the designer had no intention of making mothra sexy and just gets freaked out seeing these reactions before looking at his creation and going what the fuck are these people seeoh my god wait im okay with this

  thank you
super robot wars t trailer  think everyone will shit themselves over cowboy bebop  nope  pic related  why is rayearth such a deep cut it got me too but i dont know why
  because mahou shoujo is love mahou shoujo is life all seriousness though bebop will always be remembered thanks to toonami and being a gateway anime so seeing it in srw probably just gave it a meh or a huh rayearth getting any sort of love or attention shows that somone involved acknowledges that the show and its fandom exists and matters to an extent  thread theme    this is a rayearth thread
i forgot when isekai anime used to not be shit
  funny how a lot of early isekai started out with female protagonists such as in rayearth escaflowne and twelve kingdoms i wonder why hey had a lot of female protags then
  even inuyasha kinda counts when you think about it
  tomaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaranaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
  and fushigi yugi too
i cant hear anything over how hype i am over  ggg brave express might gaine getter robo armageddon votoms g gundam zeta gundam crossbone gundams gunbuster and mazinger z all being in the same game    this is insane levels of hype for me
    i think a lot of girls are just day dreamers at that age there where plenty of decent to good ones with dude protags im not really sure why so many shojo caught on though     the big problem is that they more less stopped being adventure stories where the isekaid sap is now some neet shut in who just wants to bum around and do nothing for a dozen light novels like rayearth escaflowne el hazard all fine escapist fantasy but even in escapist fantasy the characters would still try to either get home save the world or both and learn and grow along the way that doesnt happen anymore because why change when youre perfect because you have mad gamer skills      inu fucking yasha is an example of how to do a proper isekai these days    fucking hell
  because bebop      dont forget a lion a witch and a wardrobe where siblings got isekaid oh i guess dunbine and garzeys wing count too
i saw the ggg logo and jumped out of my gd bed    h o t b l o o d e d
    connecticut yankee before even that
  i dont count inuyasha because she can go back and forth
    i dont see why that matters
  super robot wars t trailer  think everyone will shit themselves over cowboy bebop  nope  wasnt here during the announcement trailer thread was filled with people going crazy for bebop  igoring the twitter feed going crazy over bebop  nobody cared    meanwhile rayearth mostly got a its about dam time or why wasnt this in x reaction i think you fags overestimated how many people actually remember rayearth
  considering the neet is depicted as having a shitty life before being whisked off to notdragon quest world 4536 and becoming the equivalent of an uber kewl speshul fabio i cannot see why a character like that would want to return back to the original world i think that the protagonist has to have a compelling enough reason and a solid enough mindset to want to return back home even if he or she wasnt super special awesome or has ussues that he or she still has to deal with youre right in that the older type of protagonists end up maturing and moving on in their life and that a visit to a foreign fantastic world may have been the spark to set that off
  so can john carter and those pevensie kids
i hope they deliver big time with this one great cast list imo v was decent x was kind of a letdown from the previous i think t might be the big favorite among the three ps4 games now we await og character next month
    i dont know for whatever reason i feel like the magic of isekai is lost when you arent trapped there and now have to live in a completely different world
    well even disregarding the whole wanting to go home thing there seems to a lot less emphasis on growing up and maturing through an adventure you dont have to go home joe campbell isnt an absolute law but you do have to show some growth as a character instead its always just the same black/brown haired slacker who just bss his way through shit while getting a harem for no reason its like theyre afraid to paint their audience in a negative light because they cant handle seeing gamer nerd not be treated as the best amazing special
  technically the pevensies had some strict restrictions that kept them from really freely visiting narnia willynilly hell the older two were only allowed to visit twice while lucy and edmund got there thrice
like remember when we used to have athlete protagonists    
  bebopfags are the worst i bet only americans care for it anyway
    she still has to go on the quest and gets into all sorts of trouble i mean say what you will about her but i think its actually impressive of kagome to stick with to the end only out of a sense of personal responsibility when she has such an easy out
  joe campbell isnt an absolute law but you do have to show some growth as a character  unless your character was always awesome  yes i know he does develop as a character but its minimal compared to most of the cast
    i wouldnt call it minimal it was just more subtle theres a big issue these days where people think that in order to through character growth you have to do a complete 180 and change who you are entirely and that couldnt be further from the truth and is frankly kind of lazy a good character arc can have the character be mostly who they are when they started but just less of a dick or with a better sense of understanding the world you mature but you dont have be a different person
  you dont have to go home joe campbell isnt an absolute law but you do have to show some growth as a character  fair point i was stuck on the return back home aspect as the motivating factor but as you say its not an absolute thnking about it youko the red headed protag in twelve kingdoms initially wanted to go home but her calling to lead one of the kingdoms forced her to wrestle between her desire to go back home and the responsibilities she has as a destined queen in the end her growth through the series allowed her to make the hard decision to stay and help deal with the issues in the fantasy world even if it meant leaving a familiar flawed world behind she didnt go home as you would say but she did some growing up for sure
          dont forget the second gaiking series was an isekai also marchen awakens romance despite it being one long tournament arc is still better than most isekai series being churned out today
mfw seeing how much the saturn game goes for now
  marchen awakens romance was charming how is it that little boys wanting to find their dads in another world ended up being a nice plot to have
    right finding a way back home is really just the most obvious goal for the characters but it doesnt have to be the only plot you dont have to do that but you should be doing something to get your characters to go an explore the world they find themselves in
  finding your missing dad can be the goal too
    searching for a person is a very relatable goal
    searching for a loved one is more based and relateable goal as  said than being a lazy asshole who wants to appear normal or be a fucking baker in an isekai world when he could have been a baker in the real world
  lack of trider g7 enemies killed the hype for me not caring for rayearth and ggg units only fighting ei15 wasnt exactly reassuring see also bx
    is this a flame of recca spinoff i heard joker is in it
    man i fucking loved flame of recca shame it never got a full adaptation
  think everyone will shit themselves over cowboy bebop    the crowd who creams themselves over bebop are basic bitches who never moved beyond shows that wasnt aired outside of toonami they probably watched a bit of gundam w seed maybe ibo or whatever other shows thats more readily available in the west so its no wonder they dont even know about the existence of srw
  if gaogaiger doesnt have a crossfranchisecombination attack with el dorado like orgun and dboy had in w i am going to be very very disappointed
  like orgun and dboy had in w  where
  like orgun and dboy had in w  you mean something map/event only because i dont recall them having a team attack at all i dont really think srw has any cross franchise attacks unless they have some really close conection like the dynamics nagahama or mutekis hell theres not even a gunbusterdiebuster combination attack in the games that featured both
  why is rayearth such a deep cut it got me too but i dont know why  i am still recoiling from the sheer amount of hype that knocked me off my feet when i heard about this   previously ive only ever watched clips of gameplay of srw but now i can feel it i am literally going to end up buying a switch just so i can play this      rayearth getting any sort of love or attention shows that somone involved acknowledges that the show and its fandom exists and matters to an extent      exactly my sentiment for a while it seemed like nobody but spics have cared about rayearth since 2006/7 except for literally one guy i was introduced to irl theres enough people on /m/ for me to sperg out about it on the regular but it was just really painful thinking that rayearth was pretty much going to disappear into obscurity without any sort of contemporary acknowledgement when only a decade and a half ago it had near gundam wing levels of popularity
    my memories is really tarnished since i played that shit when i was in early highschool i should really replay it again to refresh myself
  next spring itll be a decade since srw k  lordy where does the time go
    you blokes do know that the rayearth girls got some figma action figures quite recently yes
  yes but what about actual content i will say that i am a bit of a merch whale when it comes to rayearth i already own two versions of plush mokona and i bought the first season dvd set for my little cousin and one of the production cels from the anime so i probably was gonna get a hikaru figma at some point but nothing beats having some actual writing done even if it is just a little bit of noncanon story bits that lets them exist in a crossover game
  tfw played k on release and enjoyed it because it has a bunch of edgy looking machines  years later when i can actually fully comprehend moonrunes i found out that everyone hated that game to bits because of the meanspirited writing
  didnt help that k plagarized music outright and the dual system was borked
  just dont go acting like no one cared about rayearth it already has more than most series get
    well with sakura getting a new anime recently im surprised more clamp fags arent speaking up
  i was still a kid back then so that didnt bother me too much i replayed j and w quite a lot on my nds and k just came off at a bit weird when i first fired it up    i remembered thoroughly hating the og music and mechs design though which is weird because most of his other designs are fucking great
  mfw i have the saturn game
    which disc mines hikaru
  you lucky bastard
tfw you where a saturn fag from the start and have most of the big titles
  hikaru didnt know they did variants    yeah i got on the rayearth train back in the vhs days    from the start  thats not so lucky i got in as it died so i paid thirty for a new saturn and the same for rayearth got my ten controllers and two multitaps for bomberman at trus as they clearanced them good stuff
  hikaru didnt know they did variants    each of the girls got a disc wd always made a ton of variants of their releases    thats not so lucky    playing fighters megamix vf2 and finding out how import friendly it was make for a strong argument to that statement friend i had a lot of fun with my saturn and with hongo as my witness i wouldnt change a minute of it
  wd always made a ton of variants of their releases  neat   i had a lot of fun with my saturn  oh yeah before the cps2 got emulated it was essential but getting it at launch was pretty pricey
  but getting it at launch was pretty pricey    santa clause was very good to me that year getting straights as will earn you a lot of nice list points
  it was just sad because it looked like it was falling by the wayside it would be like the feeling you get if youre a wingfag and know that the likelihood of a frozen teardrop adaptation is incredibly slim except with the added feelsbadman of not being in basically any media for 15 years despite the original being a smash hit       also there are still no models or even figurines of rayearth wingdam and celeste let alone the fto and gto
  oh yeah over twenty years ago was almost a quartercentury ago that makes sense then how santa could intervene back then    also there are still no models or even figurines of rayearth wingdam and celeste let alone the fto and gto  not just merch theyre so bad off theyre on the theres barely any highres art list
    i remember hearing a lot that the reason for its exclusion was because everything was named after a car that always struck me as a spurious claim though
  super robot wars t trailer  think everyone will shit themselves over cowboy bebop  nope  anon even /v/ had threads about bebop when it was announced
  theres barely any highres art list    when you dig up art from old shit you where in and its all super small resolution  and thats if you can find it at all and it hasnt be lost in the internet avalanche     fucking hell
  well might not be too far off from the truth when they say everything was named after a car they literally arent kidding    
  here on /m/ the reaction does seem a tad more muted than the mainstream for a series like bebop but thats probably due to everyone here being well acquainted with good scifi anime    or it could just be that theres a lot of people with unusual taste here that dont even really give a fuck speaking personally ive known about the show forever but ive never felt the inclination to watch it until now made it through the first three episodes so far good stuff but yeah cant say ive seen anything that would warrant over the top enthusiasm for it being in t im much more excited for gun x sword
    yell yes and a lot of them arent even subtle i just dont think the names are specific enough to where an automotive company could make a case against an anime company was me point
  because rayearth is good
only the first season was good
    well i think the simple fact of the matter is that the people who would get hyped for bebop probably arent the same people who go around looking for srw news i mean i actually love me some bebop but it was the last thing i was expecting im not shitting id sooner expect ko beast
  theres barely any highres art list  thankfully we have some lady who put together a fan archive of sorts that does provide a good amount from two of the illustration books pic related        its been an absolute godsend as far as being able to listen to some of the more obscure image songs in motherfucking flac too and deciding which albums to buy also has translated lyrics which is nice    its also got references on the names covers and isbns of other auxillary material that would presumably have more artwork in them
    neat
  those fuckers dont even play srw anyway who cares what they think
  same creator he reused some characters for both now that i think about it flame of recca was an isekai like inuyasha
  flame of recca was an isekai like inuyasha    no it wasnt a couple characters got sent to the future but the main story just takes place in modern times and one of the people from said past had to take the long road its more like a yuyu hakusho knock off if anything    kagehoshi is a total milf
  doraemon even has everything before that    time travel  isekai  space travel  space war  super robot war  etc
you will never go skiing with the girls
  not knowing about joker being sent to a fantasy world after being sucked into his black hole
    i know about it but that doesnt make recca a isekai somefrom rekka got issekaid to mar but recca isnt more one than gaogaigar is a horror show because betterman was its spinoff
also betterman return when
  comfy
  indeed      a shame the illustration book didnt have any of emeraudes mech though
  man doraemon is like the ultimate science fiction/fantasy show for kids at least their movies and specials
    you went for regina rather than the far superior rex
  nah i actually went with this dude but the one i post earlier was the worst offender    bright red and bright blue just doesnt fit inside a single design
  back when isekai was great and instead of isekai where characters mature after characterforging hardships and trials like escaflowne dunbine or rayearth we get shit like overpowered skellies/slimes/smartphone users/etc fucking around and one shooting anything that looks at them with mean eyes    said that kinda funny how quite a few of the high profile old school isekai were mecha i think there was even a tenchi spinoff that was mecha isekai those were the good times when isekai actually meant something
    i dont know i feel like the sprite handled it a lot better than the official art but then im a sucker for rex and its moveset and i really like tanimesos style
  will she be friends of cham silky and etc or she will be so clingy of lantis that wont let any other faery near him
  working designs    now theres a name i havent heard for a long time
    i miss them fuck the weebs
  and fuck you too
  i love tanimesos designs too but this just didnt click for me i think the main element that made me dislike the og mechs so much is because of the boring and sometimes bad og music
how much was obari involved with it the first opening was obari as fuck in the second half and sometimes the mashins look obariesque
will they port srwt to the game gear
  wasnt rayearth trending on japanese twitter after the announcement and bebop
will sirbine get any extra attacks now it has its actual mc
  not unless they give it a new weapon but it will probably get some animation changes but mainly what were probably going to get out of the dunbine ova is hd zwauth my body is ready
anyone knows how is the plot of the new stories of dunbine i was wondering how it could interact with rayearth being fellow otherworld series    maybe the big bads from those ovas join the fourway battle for cephiro
  its because for the longest time clamp has said that they werent ever going to let rayearth into things like srw so it being in is a monumental occasion
  people have been saying that for years but i never saw a single source with an official statement by clamp where they say that
  when project z is complete
  may have something to do with concerns that their characters was named after car lines and models
  is rayearth worth watching yes or no    is it a dyke show
  pontiac/gm didnt sue sunrise for transam so i dont think thats the case
  we really should start bothering goodsmile company to make rayearth nendos to go along with their figmas
  no its rather bad
  so is it officially super scifi wars now
  pretty sure thats because this is about the 4th time cowboy bebop is featured on a robot crossover game     sunrise world war still has the best and silliest crossover cast in existence
  very worth it they are in contact with their feminity no lesbo sjw shit there and each have their own male love interest/s
  i think thats the direction bamco wanted to take it towards
    girls sucked into a jrpglike world go on an adventure to collect the giant mecha gods and save the world     sounds generic but the characters actually get development probably worth it just for the visuals and ost
  not until sharkotpus junior is a playable unit
  for those that dont know the original sharktopus from sharktopus died in its debut the one in the sequels was from an asexually reproduced egg therefore making the original sharktopus senior syfy needs to make s11 sharktopuss code name a movie icon have it fight some mecha like they did with mega shark this reminds me i still need to see sharknado 6
  i wouldnt mind their script changes if they didnt completely fuck up the difficulty for anything they localize
  yes expect feels but dont expect it to be a masterpiece
  tenchis half brother or nephew or something is the reincarnation of some other world artificial human super fighter slave that gets him summoned back to that world after it underwent a tech/society reset into a fantasy world in the distant past the mech part are these nanomachine egg things that upon certain people entering transform into a unique mech but the number of girls who can use them outnumber the guys with the ability to use them like 10 to 1 so society is matriarchal    or something like that at least
  literature is probably getting worse as time goes on
  hell theres not even a gunbusterdiebuster combination attack in the games that featured both  this will never not make me sad all i wanted was nono to get an attack together with her heroine
  god bless her soul
  is it a dyke show  only in my dreams
    theres also dual
  i fukin love war on geminar      no lesbo sjw shit there  gay shit in jap cartoons is almost never tinged with that sort of politics which is why i think its kind of appealing       is rayearth worth watching yes or no  definitely yes but a fair warning is that the mechs dont show up until the second half of the first season so if you were expecting mecha action for the early parts of the series youll be kind of let down as an entire package its kind of like gundam f91 in that it has some pretty cool moments in it and has a lot of unused potential for a lot more the feeling is different though in that in f91 the upsetting feeling comes from knowing that the team lacked the resources to finish proper whereas with rayearth its more like they just didnt do enough other than that though its gundamxlevels of comfy      considered sending her a thank you email but an update post on a different section of the site leads me to believe she might not really like channers      i dont think they could have if they wanted to transamerica is its own company you know
  do the mecha actually fight much in rayearth my garbled childhood memories seem to indicate that the girls special swords mattered more and there was a lot more on foot combat
  the mecha is come out around the late part of the anime after they went some trial from what i remembered
have umi figma  other two arent anywhere to be found on mandarake    he hates it
  isekai stuff in the 90s came out of a much larger craze in japan for western high fantasy  anything before the craze really works but other than znt in the 00s and those who hunt elves and el hazard the faces were still shows like slayers lodoss ryuknight etc
i havent even watched the show and i got hyped for it still the most hyped thing for me was harlock
  the first season is the quest to get the mecha theyre only used actually at the very end in the second season theyre used in pretty much every episode
  looks like we found our combination attack
  is there a srw game with the earth engine impacter yet or should i just keep waiting until my brain necrotises and i forget about it
mfw hikaru is nene  
  nah this is hopefully itll look a bit better in the game though the entire zagato fight was disappointingly low budget in the anime
      yeah see thats the thing s1 theyre running around mostly on foot having jrpg shenanigans so the henchmen dont really have mecha themselves either it isnt until the very end that they get the three robots and they have a final boss fight that leads to a hidden boss fight     which begs the question how are they going to integrate rayearths story exactly i mean okay cephiro is a separate world where will creates reality and people can literally wish/dream things into being but we can fudge that as just being some other part of byston well or some such possibly but legit the most that the s1 baddies have is alcyone riding a unicorn and ascot summoning monsters the only way i can see them doing it is to have the initial intro be right before/right at their final fight and hey zagatos mashin is in the promo and then they just roll into s2 for the duration of the game and we saw eagle and the nsx in the promo unless theyre going to be fighter roar/master asia/bontakun grade onfoot units for half the game
  what is going on
  belly button blowing yo
  captain earth is notable for being the only new series on the nowclosed card chronicle then it finally appeared on another game xomega but hey at least there they can chat with star driver cast
  if cephiro and byston well are the same world then they can spend plenty of time in s1 fighting aura battlers theyll skip the presia arc and go directly to the mashin collection arc
  between rayearth g gundam gxs and bebop they might actually have a few stages with human sized units though i wouldnt expect any to be permanent even gai could be a temporary ss unit how cool will it be if you can will knife vicious in the face  if they dont do ss units then i guess rayearth season 1 plot will go by pretty quick indeed but theyre still gonna do something with it alcyone is one of the most memorable enemies in the series im sure theyre gonna come up with a way for us to fight her ascot riding on a giant summon could be a thing and i guess he could have caldina and lafarga as an attack inouva can totally be a boss fight in his monster form it was pretty big  aside from that there were a ton of monsters in cephiro they can pick a handful of designs that showed up and use them as generic enemies to inflate stages and zagato gladly will ally with any faction that promises to help him kill the magic knights hes beyond the point of caring about collateral damage
  magic knight rayearth is in  g gundam is in  super robot wars t      clamps tback/queen gundam as a secret unit          alicesadventures in wonderland through the looking glass and the wizard of oz series
      i mentioned this in one of the previous srw generals so my ideas was to just plain give to zagatos minions their mashins from the ovas to pad s1 material and also give ferio his own ova mashin later during s2 events because why not    after all he needs to have his attempt to save fuu later on and would look better if he had his own mashin by then
  not a great idea honestly the ova designs dont fit in with the tv ones at a all and how are those gonna characters gonna get mashins just creating them like emeraude and zagato did they shouldnt be that powerful  ferio rescuing fuu will just be a cutscene
  could always handwave them as zagato willing them into existence for them after offscreen repeated failures back when they fought person/monsters to person    when zagato bites the dust the likes of ascot end up mashinless and later in s2 events eventually wills it back into existence being more strong willed than he was before and able to sustain its existence also he was poweful enough to change his age in s2 so why not    at the very least i can see alcyone getting her own mashin made by her own will her devotion for zagato feels mashin creationworthy as willpower is one hell of a drug there and she was powerful on her own    and no reason to dismiss for design differences ova godmars is fairly different to tv godmars mecha designs and went to marg all the same in srw d for some reason    thats it all assuming s1 gets used for more than just the final battle early on which might be the case zagatos mashin could easily be recycled for lantis in case they dont want to waste a good design and set of animations for a one time unit as well
  unless theyre going to be fighter roar/master asia/bontakun grade onfoot units for half the game    not quite unthinkable actually most of early s1 consisted of the girls fighting huge monsters that stand quadruple human height and winning    their weaponry is a lot stronger than youd think quite early in theres an episode with a honking huge sandskidding monster somewhere halfway inbetween a shark and a stingray fuu cuts the damn thing straight in half with a single cleave of her sword simply by righting it upwards as the beast itself dives for her and having it filet itself    the metal from which their swords and armor are crafted is not only selfevolving ie growing to adapt to the wielders potential it is also _crazy_ strong its ore is completely impossible to temper via normal smelting processes for one
  i can see alcyone getting her own mashin made by her own will    alcyone canonically returns in season 2 riding a top a flying variation of one of lady debonairs monsters after her mind snapped near the end of season 1  when zagao spurned her in favor of emeraude she wandered cephiro aimlessly and eventually found her way to debonair who became a surrogate for her affection
  ofcourse since debonair canonically _is_ able to create mashin for other people  shes the one who created regalia for nova  i guess she could gift alcyone one as well    ferio and ascot getting their oav mashin is unlikely though theyre far too monstrous for a hero role
  at the very least ferios could be mistaken for an aura battler if it were to be used    although it would be funny if said aura battlers were mistaken for typical rpg monsters due their monstruous looks in the obligatory encounter with byston wellians
  i dont think theyre gonna go out of their way to make lantis playable hes important to the story because of how hikaru feels but he doesnt actually do much of anything and in the end were gonna have to rescue him from nova  if they did want to make him playable giving him his own mashin is totally plausible as hes supposed to be about as powerful as his bro it could just look like zagatos or be an original design get clamp and/or obari to do it  another way of making him usable could be to just give him an autozam machine we see in a very brief flashback that he once piloted something that looked almost exactly like geos gto so if the gto is in the game which in itself seems kind of unlikely then a second gto for lantis could be a thing or he could just cuck geo out of his unit like he cucked him out of eagle
because its rayearth
  nova  that reminds me is there any indication if this the tv or the comics  theyd need the tv license specifically if they had her right
  when they use the manga version they always specify with 原作漫画版 in the cast list they didnt this time so its the tv version you can also easily tell from rayearths design
    man alcyone got fucked in s2 i mean i know she was an ultra cunt being seeing how broken she was and then even after deciding to help the good teamshe didnt deserve that
  oh yeah that makes sense
  all i know is im importing this song to the game if it aint in the vanilla lineup   
  belly button forte mixed with daichi and teppeis totally no homo competition for a pretty necklace with whoever surprises the other gets the necklace until they get one upped
  is captain earth worth looking at
  cowboy bebop was in multiple totally not srw games before for rayearth its an actual first  
  no and no    its a very old japanese show for girls thing which means fawning over boys and talking about boys and boisboisboisboisbois nonstop forever because girls can think of nothing else    it does carry it to a super retarded extent though so much so that the motive of the true villain is related to it might be worth watching just to see the stupid twist
  it was pretty good as far as a mecha show goes
  why do they still put lame mecha series like gao gay gar getter robo
  they should contact squareenix and get the rights to add the xenogears mechas
  its a very old japanese show for girls thing which means fawning over boys and talking about boys and boisboisboisboisbois nonstop forever because girls can think of nothing else
  rayearth is first isekai  then also a mecha anime  then also a shoujo    if you are not into shoujo you could still watch for the isekai and for the mechas
  mama is a 4th grader  wut
bebop a shit
  rayearth sucked ass though so recommending it is just wrong
  its okayish ill hate it for the spammer who keeps begging /a/s drawthreads for pitz images to shit all over /m/ though
  are you the spammer that keeps calling pitzfag a pedophile for no reason
  some anon spends litterally five years spamming /m/ over and over with beargguy macros and maybe pitz images  thats not spamming dont be stupid    someone shit posts a thread for a few days  woah hold on there fella thats some serious spam right there
  asks a question and you over react  yep youre the spammer alright
  i think you are falling for a false flag again
  a false flagger tries false flagging by crying false flag  nice try but ive seen inception too
  you are being paranoid not everyone is your boogieman
    have a you
  thanks stranger
                  not sure what just happened there but i guess ill take a look
  first season is a definite must  you can skip second season if you want though
  second season is better though
  is there space dandy
  only if you prefer floof over plot pacing or characterization
ive started watching rayearth and its not that good so far   the plot and setting are rather generic and the pacing is a little too slow so far   the art is very good but sadly its a bit too much on the plain side even if there are some really interesting shots here and there   the chibi humor got old very fast too it definitely feels like a serie i would enjoy as a kid but as of now its petty meh     im waiting for the robots to appear but im only at episode 6 at least he girls are cute
  keep watching and leave this thread to avoid spoilers
  the plot and setting are rather generic    if there was ever a complaint that pisses me off it this one its a empty vapid statement by people who cant allow themselves to get absorbed into the moment to moment aspects of a story because theyre constantly picking part whatever theyre watching in some lame attempt to seem more intellectual then they are and to make their chosen medium appear to be something deeper than it actually wants or even needs to be    and this isnt me saying turn your brain off so dont jump to that gun but just watch the damn show for what it is a fun adventure story christ not everything needs to be the next genre changer this was made in 199 goddamn 3
  im watching it for what it is but it wont stop it from being generic so far im not trying to appear smart when watching cartoons and i enjoy old motw super robot shows sadly fantasy is not my cup of tea and i wont forgive a show not putting enough efforts in its plot and setting just because its just a fun adventure story   i felt the same about dunbine barely developping its wolrd beyond a couple of exotic races and castles in forest for most of the episodes and that was a decade before mkr 3 years later escaflowne is much more interesting and deserves praise surely i can criticize a show 3 years younger for not trying hard enough in my opinion   anyway its way too soon to judge the serie as im not very far but generic is a valid complaint among others that can thankfully be forgotten if the show stand out on other merits
  is that official
    i really dont like the honeycomb lines all the mechs in infinity had
  rayearth front and center  they know what theyre doing
  yeah pretty terrible way to modernize design
    seriously sprucing it up may have been one thing but thats just way to noisy theres zero reason to mess with a classic
fucking rayearth got in and we didnt even got escaflowne to go with it as a returning series    also it got in before vandread/dual    fucking how
  look it up on sankaku channel
  bebop a shit then again i was that entertained by either dual or vandread
  was  wasnt
  dual was kind of okayish back then i just want it in for the nostalgia factor    vandread however i remember being very good dont know if its the same on rewatch though
  dunno how you but i will enjoy george and umi having fencing sessions
  one day well have dunbine rayearth escaflowne and a number of other fantasy mecha series in a srw game
  nobody cares about this ancient shit dude the series has been pandering to 50 year old shutins for too long
  because rayearth is the least bad of all of those    still isnt what id call good though
  reminder that the retarded old bad new good mentality is just as trash as old good new bad
  no sirbine there what a waste of an opportunity rayearth feels a bit out of place there as the only straight fantasy mecha there
  its a garbage anime people think is good for no reason
  all i care about is that g gundam has finally made a return    it was the reason i bought srw mx my first srw game back in 04 and that was the last time its been on a console im beyond hyped    also ggg is a huge plus im on this game like white on rice
    hitomi from escaflowne may have had funky futurevisions but her most consistently useful skill was motherfucking track and field     girl spends like half the show running and jumping
  i legitimately dont understand why people like rayearth the plot and characters arent even remotely interesting aside from the brief bits regarding emeraude and eagle the animation is extremely lackluster music is mehtier the show is plagued by needless dumb and far too easily resolved misunderstanding conflicts in the second half and any time the show attempts to start moving in a more interesting direction like with lantiss past or the fact that presia really was dead the show squanders it and nothing results     the only good thing i can say about it is that i enjoyed the art style it was boring at best
  huuuuuuuuuuuuuuur duuuuuuuuuuuuurr  me no like show  why people like show  people shouldnt like show that bores me the allmighty universelord  fuck off retard  people can legitimately like and enjoy a show that bores you  going all supah ann and mal animu critic about it wont change any of it  its fine if the show bores you its not fine to go saying people cant like it or seriously go  why do people like this thing i dont like like an autistic child who cant understand the basic concept of different opinions  fuck critic culture and fuck standards if all it leads to is acting like autists and trying to control opinions because in exchange for objective analyisis you have to give up any understanding of different opinions and level up your obnoxious autist class to its max level
  i feel the bebop crew will be fucking terrible as units
  the first half of the series was a fun and comfy if pretty predictable adventure as far as overall plot goes
  please grow up then maybe youll see the irony in what youre saying       i sorta get that but the pacing was a bit slow and i personally find umi and fuu to be pretty obnoxious so the show having more of a focus on them in the first part didnt help
  and i personally find umi and fuu to be pretty obnoxious    you can go straight to hell
  what irony explain mr grown up wise sage  my problem is with your attitude coming to a thread to say people like it for no good reason like theyre wrong in liking the show and then offer a lot of arguments about why the show fails for you as a justification that no one should possibly like the show and thus people liking it is beyond your understanding  you can dislike a show without throwing shit at those who do
  first off im not   second off that guy wasnt throwing shit at anyone regardless  thirdly the irony was that you claimed that i shouldnt dictate what people think about thing while you were dictating that people shouldnt even discuss thing
  no dunbine or swordfish
  any of you fellas know where to legally stream rayearth if there is anywhere because mediablasters youtube channel has 14 or so episodes of season 1 while tms inexplicably blocked the other 6 and im not willing to fork over 74 bucks for rayearths bluray
  dunbine was on the cover of x but the swordfish i guess its not iconic or photogenic enough having two ships on the cover probably wouldnt be kosher
  you can discuss thing without going  you have no reason to like thing objectively no reason whatsoever   in fact acting the way i am against is what destroys discussion because theres no discussion  just an agree with me or youre idiot/shit taste/whatever other form of inferior person  sure the dude didnt explictly shit on anyone but it was very implied by what he said  when someone says people like a show for no reason and proceeds to list negative criticism i see no reason to read that criticism as respecting different opinions i see it as you should dislike the show like i doi feel so super enlightened and smart hating this compared to the idiots who like it  call me a cynic but thats how i see a lot of people think and certain sentences act as flags telling me when im dealing with one of those objective faggots like people dislike/like x for no reason i dont understand why people like/dislike x
the problem with criticism is when people makes broad statements of little to no value rather than offering examples     it is the difference between pointing at several instances where the show clearly expressed its flaws thus giving strenght to a generalization and merely saying things like yeah it is boring has no direction and i will mention one or two well known weaknesses to look like i actually know my shit
ive never played a srw game before but i played sd gundam g generation genesis and this looks kind of similar i enjoyed gundam but i got bored after a while can anyone let me know how srw games compare im looking for something with a bit more depth gundam was very simple and every stage was just an open field but i enjoyed the upgrade / collection aspect of it any recommendations on where to start or anything i should know are the stories in these games any good
  g generation games are grinder games where you play the same stages repeatedly to farm suits and experience srw is more of a visual novel with a strategy game attached the appeal is in watching a story about all of your favorite giant robot anime merged into one where all the characters from different shows interact and events get mixed up by each others presence while still following the general arc of each show    gameplaywise its a bit more involved than g generation with more resource management but only a bit the games are usually balanced around the idea of letting you take your favorite handful of characters upgrade the shit out of them until theyre oneman armies and let them loose some games are harder but usually theyre pretty easy the appeal of its really in the animations and crossover stories
  dual was kind of okayish back then i just want it in for the nostalgia factor  i remember the plot trying to be wacky but honestly i didnt get what made it good to some people
  none of the new srw games are hard unless they are remakes of old ones and kept some archaic mechanics
  streaming  just grab a torrent
      in addition to this most of the difficulty would come from trying to get all the skill points as every stage in modern srw has a special condition to get them and selfimposed challenges like no upgrade runs or sidekick mecha only    the thing about srw is that the difficulty is balanced around runs with few or no upgrades and shit gets out of balance if you pump all your money and resources into specific units would be comparable to playing pokemon and only using your starter as that would turn it into an overpowered unstoppable engine of destruction for a long time
  was this the first
  if the point of og isekai was maturing and taking responsibility then i think kagome had a pretty reasonable setup for not just abandoning the past things were fucked when she arrived and then she fucked them up even worse
   in season 2 hikaru has a hot yandere lesbian doppelganger 
  i guess its time for me to get into rayearth then should i watch it or read it any major differences
  im a huge rayearthfag but i agree that it can be pretty generic and uninteresting the plot holes lack of worldbuilding and all around squandered potential also makes me upset furthermore i can only stomach the melodrama because i enjoy that genre for its stupidfun qualities and i understand that its extremely grating to the rest of humanity im pretty sure most people just like rayearth for its accessibility character designs and general fantasy aesthetic    but i have to disagree with you on the music i have the soundtrack and its phenomenal
  umi  yeah but she grows right the fuck up when she gets her rune god    fuu  you wot
  kinda unrelated but anyone know why media blasters channel is so disorganized no playlists for the things that need them and their video/sound quality is 2003tier
  the manga and anime diverge 90 after the first arc when i read it i thought it was pretty much nonsense but its a short series so you could finish it in a night if you want to the second season is also a different genre kinda from the first season so the non mecha battle segments may bore you just hold out for best girl to show up
  because its more known than vandread and dual combined
  you mean the same series that have been in like every fucking game might gaine was in the last 2 ffs and oh boy gundam that we already have seen a billion times you must be some sort of shill to actually be hype for this
  im gonna be honest rayearth isnt particularly good from just a strict storytelling perspective and i get being frustrated with how it kind of seems like a generic adventure story when i first watched it i was actually falling asleep in the early episodes although a lot of this has to do with me usually watching this kind of stuff at night in a comfy bed so im not sure what really made me keep going besides my desire to have an innocent fun mecha show i could get my little cousin into i think as i kept watching though the characters all really grew on me even that little shit ascot the ending to the first season was kind weak in relation to a lot of other stuff thats out there but it was still somewhat of a surprise and left a strong enough impression that overall i had a positive view of the story    i think the point that i really started being a fan of rayearth is when a year later i found out there was a part ii and watched it in its entirety i couldnt shake the feeling at the end of it that i just wanted more of it and then over time i realized part of what makes rayearth so good in my eyes and its actually the same reason why i like works like gundam f91 so much theres a lot of potential in this thing even if its lacking some followthrough    theres so many concepts and questions this show kind of subtly places on the table but then doesnt really go through with unwrapping or further exploring the ethical problems of living in a utilitarian society selfdetermination the dark parts of the human psyche etc
  for example remember the pillar system the unspoken implication of selecting a single person of strong will to give up all personal ambition in order to support an entire worlds population through directed prayer is that the entire world population is so weakwilled that they cant even pray for their own basic survival needs let alone their own success and theyre so psychologically cucked that their fears and nightmares manifest physically and tear the place apart by season 2 cephiro is literally a few strongwilled individuals maintaing a crystal citadel on a floating disembodied jagged rock that is 90 crumbled away housing the entire surviving population the problem is so widespread and ingrained that their legends describe how individuals called magic knights have to be summoned from totally different worlds to assist in times of dire need because they literally cant do anything for themselves its such a strong point that clamp could have explored a bit more but the most we get is that in the comics hikaru wishes away the pillar system but nothing is said about how to resolve the fact that without the pillar system cephiro as a people literally are too weak to exist they are so weak that they are always one person away from their livelihoods getting destroyed and being simultaneously invaded by 3 different countryworlds while their own planet disintegrates beneath their feet personally i think the people of cephiro should have had a bigger presence in the story and some attempt made by someone in the cast to inspire a sense of initiative and responsibility in the masses and eliminate the need for a pillar that way that would have been a great direction to take it even if something like a relatively spontaneous cultural transformation predicated on a single moment in that cultures history is a bit on the nose
  we know and love nova the sum of hikarus resentment and frustration from the first season manifested in the form of iczer4 at first i really questioned the inclusion of this character but i think conceptually it works really well if they only elaborated more on it novas motivations were also kind of questionable iirc i cant even remember why she acted the way she did if she really was just an extension of hikarus psyche there was again a lot of potential here with relatively lackluster execution by the tv writers     and how about fucking autozam holy shit when those flashbacks that  posted came up i got super excited just the vague descriptions alone of that faction really got me going especially with lantiss involvement in that world at some point in the past autozam is just begging to have a side story written about it not to mention lantis could use a lot more development than im just a cool guy 4 u a narrative covering autozam and lantiss time there would do so much for his character and could really serve to contextualize eagles invasion effort a bit better iirc its basically a resource conflict for them their tech runs on mental energy and is losing its viability due to some detail that i either forgot or wasnt mentioned    there are some things to be said on interpersonal relationships in there too that just kind of get resolved in a really infantile way like ascots problems and umis attitude i even think that rayearth would be able to delve into some of the harderhitting subjects while maintaining the accessibility and appeal of its premise i mean for christs sake the first half of it is about the most protracted suicidebycop plot ever written in fiction im sure    theres just a whole lot to love about this story but not enough of it you know fags like  and cant fucking take it all we can do is latch onto the soundtrack and the peripheral image songs and imagine the raw potential
  fags like  and cant fucking take it    i misquoted at first whoops
  i cant even remember why she acted the way she did if she really was just an extension of hikarus psyche  because hikaru hated herself
  when was this said again
  we know and love nova  i love you hikaru im going to kill everyone you care about i love you hikaru so much im going to kill everyone you care about lantis you love him im going to kill him umi and fuu yep killing them too i love you hikaru i love you hi ka ru love you by the way going to kill everyone you love about gonna kill them kill em all i love you hikaru i really love you hikaru im going to kill umi im going to kill fuu going to kill lantis too and eagle defiantly eagle i love you hikaru  there was again a lot of potential here with relatively lackluster execution by the tv writers   the concept behind nova solid nova herself though dragged the series down whenever she was on screen the writers completely shit the bed with how they handled the additions of debonair and nova to the story    theres a conversation between hikaru and nova where nova tries to get under hikarus skin telling her how she hates herself knowing how the pillar system works its all implied
bebop a shit
is there an opposite spirit to hide one that makes enemies more attracted to one unit
  he didnt like nova  faggot
  some games final have taunt it causes a single enemy to single mindedly attack a unit once hit or miss they return to standard ai after one attack
i hope we can save eagle in the game
  it remained in alpha 1 on literately one character iirc  wufei
  i love you hikaru im going to kill everyone you care about i love you hikaru so much im going to kill everyone you care about lantis you love him im going to kill him umi and fuu yep killing them too i love you hikaru i love you hi ka ru love you by the way going to kill everyone you love about gonna kill them kill em all i love you hikaru i really love you hikaru im going to kill umi im going to kill fuu going to kill lantis too and eagle defiantly eagle i love you hikaru  thats what made it so funny it was gundamwinglevels of cheese      he probably can be saved after all he survives in one of the timelines
  because rayearth hasnt been relevant at all for like two decades
  because there is not really much to do with it anymore and ova was too different
god i wish i were mokona
  yes
  especially when youre god in the manga
  i sorta liked the aesthetic of the ova but it was indeed really really odd compared to the main version    even the dub was weird for that matter like why exactly is alcyone suddenly doing a dualvoice thing
still no kuromukuro red baron or majestic prince  and ssss gridman is going in to the list
      while it could have stood to be more overt there was a rather strong implication that the people of cephiro where realizing they needed to nut up and stand on their own at the tail end its not like they where too weak to actual go about their day they where just sort of lazy in regards to never haven to deal with real hardship

  why should i spoonfeed shitposting retards like op
    its not spoonfeeding if the knowledge isnt common and easy to come by if you dont want to provide it then dont dont pretend its because it should be simple for him to find though when it clearly isnt
  i didnt do that i pointed out that his translations are full of shit and hes retarded for posting this shit thread with misleading garbage that idiots will take seriously
    you literally just said you didnt want to spoonfeeding him
  oh so youre just as retarded as op please try to read the posts youre replying to before spewing nonsense
  let me see if i am up to date  1you claim that someone is shitposer for trying to share and discuss materials  2you claim that he is mentally disabled for not knowing a foreign language  3you refuse to provide any valuable input
  im not anybody else in this thread but you should just quit while youre behind when the op says someone who actually knows what theyre doing correct me on theses translations and you throw a spergy fit because the translations arent already correct you just look like a fucking moron    heres what really happened you read the first few translations saw they were wrong and wanted to show off by saying the translations were wrong unfortunately you didnt read the full post so you actually just come off as an ass and of course you dont dare actually provide translations of your own so all you can do is be even more insulting and try to invent some other reason for why the op is a bad person otherwise youd have to admit this all to yourself just take your lumps and walk away
    i must be because i no longer have any idea what youre refusing to spoonfeed why dont you try telling me since im prepared to admit that i am mentally incapable of understanding your point on my own and need your help to do so
fullfrontal 渇望 craving  char 信念 conviction  judau 闊達 frankness  haman 大望 vision  kamille 鼓動 inspiration  scirocco 野心 ambition    now stop being big babies
      butthurt op      still wrong
  im beginning to think you dont know what youre talking about
  every time anybody translates something therell be somebody who shows up to insist that the translation is awful and wrong regardless of its actual quality    the truth is that once you can transcribe the kanji these arent very difficult translations since theyre common two word phrases that you can easily just slap into google translate or jisho and get reasonably close
     admit that im lost and ask politely for help   butthurt    what wouldnt be butthurt to you out of interest
    my two cents  where does the inspiration part come from kodou 鼓動 is a word you often hear in anime and it means beat or pulse i dont know what it is supposed to mean in this context in any case inspiration doesnt make sense to me as a description for kamille  openminded or maybe more precisely broadminded seem to be suitable translations for 闊達  the meaning of 信念 seems to be straightforward enough to simply translate as conviction or belief    渇望 大望 野心 seem to be variations of the desire theme  渇望 katsubou seems to mean craving or longing or aspiration i dont actually remember anything about full frontal and if he has said something along this lines but it doesnt sound unlikely  大望 seems to be defined as a great/grand desire maybe rather than her ambition it is meant to emphasize her willfulness  野心 seems to have several different meanings but in the most straightforward of them it seems to be synonymous with ambition in the traditional sense
  prospect  hope  beleif  ambition  ambition  anyone not surpised japs use so many words for similar words
  if its so easy then why are op and  so wrong    fullfrontal掲望prospect  char信念belief  judau闊達openmindedness  haman大望 ambition  kamille鼓動heartbeat    judau 闊達 frankness  haman 大望 vision  kamille 鼓動 inspiration      or maybe those translations are wrong retard
   i dont know what it is supposed to mean in this context  zの鼓動      openminded or maybe more precisely broadminded seem to be suitable translations for 闊達  completely wrong    the meaning of 信念 seems to be straightforward enough to simply translate as  belief  wrong    渇望 katsubou seems to mean  longing or aspiration  wrong    maybe rather than her ambition it is meant to emphasize her willfulness  wrong
  for 闊達 the dictionary gives the definition not caring about small things why is not broadminded an apt translation    as i said 信念 is pretty straightforward so i dont know what you are on to    maybe rather than her ambition it is meant to emphasize her willfulness  wrong  so its just regular ambition
  for 闊達 the dictionary gives the definition not caring about small things why is not broadminded an apt translation  not that guy but i think you should look up broadminded in a dictionary before looking up the nip stuff
  i see no problem
   broadminded   wrong    belief  wrong    so its just regular ambition  no    read a japanese dictionary
  how would you translate not caring about small things    its not belief  so you agree with conviction then    read a japanese dictionary  i did it says great desire which is also the literal translation of the characters
this guy pops in in every thread with japanese in it always only manages to look like a retard though
  read a real japanese dictionary
  define real japanese dictionary one edited by you
  quit replying to him for fucks sake
  read a real japanese dictionary that fully defines words in japanese and isnt a garbage je online dictionary that youre copypasting outofcontext garbage form idiot
  well i dont care if he is a retard i am genuinely curious so i want to see if i can get anything out of him
  retard
  what is wrong with you
  judah  openmindedness  fucks off to jupiter at the end of the series because hed rather run away from all the problems of adults  no wonder hes not canon
    thats not what broadminded means
  or maybe that translation by this retard is wrong
          stay autistic /m/
  retard
itt magenta galaxy being magenta galaxy    fuck off back to tumblr
  i dont see anything wrong with me a broad minded person is someone who is open to ideas different from their own i think it is pretty easy to see why this would be a person who doesnt care about small things the word is often used in this context   if you feel that i am confusing it with some other word feel free to correct me and point me to the correct word because i really want to know it
  thats not the nip definition you posted
  i am not going to order a japanese dictionary just to please you  when i google 大望 意味 most links give something along the lines of 大きな望み a rather concise definition that i think translates rather straightforwardly as what ive given above
  oh youre one of those idiots who thinks translation is like a cypher and theres a perfect 11 one word translation for everything    that explains a lot
  if you dont think that broadminded is appropriate for not caring about small things give be a better word because i cant think of one
  i am not going read a real dictionary im just going to shitpost     retard
  i have no idea how you deduced this from my post if you claim that the words in op dont have 11 translation i dont see why you are being nitpicky about the translations above not being correctand why you are acting like their meaning should be common knowledge that is easily obtainable
  i dont own a japanese dictionary that you would consider on your level i did read a dictionary
  i dunno but youre still wrong though like  said words dont always translate 11 have you ever actually learned another language
  so youre literally retarded
  if english doesnt have a precise word for not caring about small things then broadminded should be good enough because it can also be interpreted that way
  i dont own a japanese dictionary that you would consider on your level  you mean a regular japanese dictionary ie not free abridged online ones or infamously inaccurate je ones    why are you arguing about a language you dont understand or own a dictionary for
  but thats wrong
  i am not arguing at all i already stated my intention
itt youre wrong but im not going to say why  all that tells me is that both of you are wrong
    theres no 11 translation  therefore i can make up whatever the fuck i want and claim its correct  retard
  then there is no word in english that means not caring about small things or one that is even close to it
  maybe there is but thats not it
  i didnt want to spoonfeed this retard but im sick of him so fine      大望 意味 most links give something along the lines of 大きな望み  wrong definition  遠大な志に基づいた大きな野望     broadminded   plain fucking garbage that doesnt even match the definition he posted himself    the meaning of 信念 seems to be straightforward enough to simply translate as conviction or belief  wrong  正しいと堅く信じ込む思想
      jesus christ not caring about small things is nothing close to the definition of broadminded you damn moron
  post is no help at all    thanks
  with the risk to invoke his anger  遠大な志に基づいた大きな野望  ambition based on a farreaching intention  正しいと堅く信じ込む思想  thought that you firmly believe is true

  掲望  this is in reference to frontal being a vessel for the hopes of other spacenoids the kanji mean to hoist to display and desire ambition  信念  id say conviction personally but its right  闊達  tricky you arent wrong but it sounds clunky to say openmindedness its contrasting his character with the closedmindedness of all those on the earth  大望  note that the second kanji is shared with frontal and amuro her desire or ambition in particular is large kind of haughty  鼓動  pulse as in love is the pulse of the stars  野心  ambition isnt wrong either but this one has a more treacherous connotation to it    t studied japanese for the last decade have been involved in fan translation projects and am even the one who translated that one gihrens greed titans ending that keeps getting posted
    why am i not suprised that this butthurt faggot is a namefag
  belief is right  wrong     闊達  tricky you arent wrong but it sounds clunky to say openmindedness its contrasting his character with the closedmindedness of all those on the earth  wrong     kind of haughty  wrong
  wrong  let me rephrase belief is correct but it misses the nuance of something like conviction    wrong  wrong    wrong  yeah youre right wrong word not really sure how to describe it in a word she has lofty ambitions i guess just leaving it as aspiration or ambition would be the closest
  kind of haughty  that guy already gave definition of 大望 as 遠大な志に基づいた大きな野望  this one has a more treacherous connotation to it  i was wondering about this too even though my fourth rate dictionary points out that the word has negative connotation i wonder if they meant it like that they picked some pretty creepy looking pictures of the villains but they seem to be trying to point out the positive sides of being a newtype
  that guy already gave definition of 大望 as 遠大な志に基づいた大きな野望  yeah i know i was trying to think of a word to sum it up nothings coming to mind its like how judaus is more of a vague idea  not being closedminded more downtoearth more free spirited    and i thought it was more showing the positive and negative side of being a newtype its asking what is a newtype and showing heroes and villains so its like are newtypes a good or an evil
  well 大望 and 信念 dont seem to be bad things they are neutral at worst as for 野望 and 野心 i dont know if they are inherently bad things in japanese in english ambition can be interpreted as a neutral or even admirable quality  as for 渇望 i dont even know
  the japanese tend to frown upon things like ambition in general but you may be right after all
      野心  literally just read a fucking dictionary    ひそかに抱く身分不相応のよくない野望
  dont know whos more stupid you or the guy screaming retard in every comment
  retard
  and according to my fourth rate dictionary 身分不相応 also applies to 野望 sounds kind of bad can 野望 also be interpreted as positive as in english or is there another equivalent word
  you realize the point of the thread is to try to come up with an english word that conveys the same or a similar meaning right
  hes not trying to help
  pulse is generally correct but it also doesnt mean anything in context its a cool call back to the subtitles of zeta gundam but not much more than that it should ideally encapsulate something bigger something more like the call to action an impetus or as was suggested up thread an inspiration    of course this is much less literal than all the other translations so take it with a grain of salt

whats /m/s favorite manga
garbage manga commisioned to succeed a garbage video game but i still love it    good times
  linebarrels of iron is pretty great /m/ bit i also enjoyed geterr robo and all the sequels
as far as /m/ stuff is concerned mikarun x wish more of it was translated though
  your pic related blame is the best
    break blade i hate it
  shin getter but honestly there arent too many manga id call favourites /m/ or otherwise so it being my absolute favourite doesnt mean too much
  original gunnm
  currently gundam thunderbolt    i bought vol 1 of the origin and its good but the full set is like 400 something in total    really wish we had more manga/light novels with giant robots
  good taste my /m/en  faithful anime adaption never ever
  front mission dog life
  not fucking getter robo for sure
  that good job not being a fag op
  is there a full translation out there
  i like exaxxion
  either this or devilman
  ded    how would they wrap up the plot with the remaining episodes
  its kinda sad seeing a release thread for a currently airing show be so empty
welp thats a lot of casualties that just got handwaved away
did destra just figure out who lupin red was in 2 seconds while the pats still havent been able to figure it out in almost a year
  theyre really stupid anon
has destras neck always looked this bad or is it because hes actually fighting now and its a different headpiece
bbut i liked this episode
  and its the thieves fault for just nonchalantly carrying their most powerful collection pieces in public
  yeah totally they should face the ganglers without their best weapons its only their own life they are risking after all
  honestly the most infuriating part about lupat is the fact that so many of the individual episodes are actually really good and yet the overall product is still a dumpster fire the show keeps simultaneously giving me reasons to absolutely love it and reasons to absolutely hate it
  i think its even deeper than that the characters and individual episode are solid episodes but we are 42 episodes in and this is the first time im willing to say we have gotten some legitimate kino teamwork the plot has gone literally no where in 40 episodes its like they just phoned in every plot line to the last 10 episodes to call it a day for the rest of the series zamigo still hasnt been resolved x and kogure being all but confirmed ganglers dogranio doing literally nothing outside of that one sheep episode everything about this season feels somewhat hollow even gauche a character that looked promising when she had that chimera of 5 safes stomping around hasnt really done anything on the villains side that could be conveyed as interesting its not a bad season its just that on a larger scale we have literally done nothing for 40 episodes and now something has to actually happen only because we are at the end and there is no more time to jerk off to old recolored props from previous seasons
  i think the series shouldve been shorter and waste less time but a sentai has to last a whole year  i think that if this series had 26 episodes it couldve been great
  probably right animewise i usually gravitate toward shows that are 25 episodes because they can tell a story without fucking around with dead air for too long i dont really mind having 50 episodes but i need something to keep my attention if we had plotlines resolving and popping up we could have had something pretty good since the cast members seem pretty interesting individually
  they just needed more of a sense of progression all the enemies from xs debut on should be status gold    and of course zamigo shouldnt be a cameo every 15ish episodes
  i noticed it was looking that bad last week too probably a new headpiece yeah
really hope they keep with final mechs being cg from now on between the cockpit view and the beam smash that was a pretty damn good endgame general battle does the striker and bomber fit on vsx too      he wasnt wearing the thief mask when kairi blurted it out
  progressiion  yeah one of the big problems lupat has is that the ganglers have no overarching goal or plan they just show up do their own thing get killed then it repeats the next week
    lupat is a case where the show is doomed by a thousand shallow cuts that add up over time the tiny issues and nitpicks just accumulate to the point they eventually suck the fun out of the show
yeah boi undress for me
  does those masks work like cute high earth defense club love censors
  hooray for me being alone then  just caught up with the series and enjoying it immensely  probably the best postgokaiger season for me over all
  that headpiece is definitely a stunt prop im fairly certain hes never had that much wrinkling and paintflaking at the bottom before either the hero got badly fucked or they didnt want to use it for location filming  as for the neck im sure it was always that bad but he never had any closeups to let you know hell he barely ever left dogranios house and that things lit like a hammer film set the black mesh eyeholes and black leather neck would just blend into each other nicely
  does those masks work like cute high earth defense club love censors  your typical perception filter stuff the wearer wont be recognized as themselves unless they reveal it on purpose
  i think the reveal will be only sakuya who surprised and the other two are just yeah figured it out already
we gotta be bait so that we can stop this guy because were gimped  really fuck noel for not giving the cops the ability to unlock safes this is another moment where they couldve easily died right along with their precious pieces thanks to that shit      x and kogure being all but confirmed ganglersx at least is confirmed to not be hes just someone arsene adopted and depending on how you see it you may even possibly call him the heir to the collection  i think that talk about him going back to the mansion in france this episode blows that theory out a bit anyway
  really why was urchin bro the only one smart enough to boobytrap his safe
  sure but i think it was on the auction episode that noel said that their thieves masks are literally cloacking devices
boss actually had a lot of respect for destra and destra was loyal to him till the end    that was really nice also noah is a fucking spy i fucking knew it i never trusted that french faggot
    you know he really isnt cmon son
      my bet the real noel got killed when dogranio took the collection and our noel is a gangler disguised as him to keep up his work
  i fully expect arsene lupin to be a gangler or some shit
  dogranio is already at the top and wants to retire so he wants a successor but to do that said successor must take over the earth thats literally the case they do this mostly out of boredom
  the preview with that guy whos coming back thinks differently though
  him being a spy literally makes zero sense at this point he risked his life on many occasions to help both the thieves and the cops fixed a collection piece and has done so many other things that prove without the shadow of a doubt that hes not on the side of the ganglers    if theres anyone who shouldnt be trusted its probably satoru anyway
  noah  help the cops    stop posting noah
  who is noah
  i was so fucking pissed that this episode put the siren striker in patren 1s hand and the victory striker in xs hand but we didnt get super patren 1 or super patren x it was perfectly timed for it and instead all we got from the patrangers was their fucking fusion bullshit
  hes a misinformed faggot and is possibly even a gangler himself just red flagging noel being adopted is a spoiler from magazine scans you can check it on jefusion
post redesigns/versions of mechs by artists in their signature style
  sculpted muscles on uc designs have always reminded of kamen rider for some reason
  looks like an orbital frame
  this artists work is awesome
  i love these
  yeah they have the artificial muscle aesthetic going on  i really dig that stuff when done minimally like in ofs or lfos stuff like evas just looks straight ultraman
mp sinanju
        tfw we will probably never get a new gundam series that uses designs like these
  imagine unicorn done in that 0079 style
  couldve been glorious
  yes
    it keeps getting better the more i look at it
  it was an anime classic that defined the genre
  a very industrial looking zeong
gundam narrative comes out in japan tomorrow and without having watched it i can already 100 guaranfuckingtee you that /m/ is going to absolutely hate it
  im hyped to see banagher back in silver bullet
well /m/ is gonna post  where is the torrent 
all i wanna know is how they tie up the third unicorn frame
  might get naked newtype hijinks with aussie and banana  im down for this desu    also reading novel spoilers  mc literally uses his dead girlfriends as stand attacks  its gonna be a hot mess hopefully the fights and hot topics craziness will be enough to keep this entertaining
  silver bullet is gonna show up in this
  there wont be one for months its a theatrical movie
  hot mess  going to a newtype voodoo celebration to complain about the newtype voodoo    if anything im going to complain if nt isnt chock full of weird shit
  yeah its even in the new trailer
   dead girlfriends  girlfriends  plural  i really hope this isnt implying what i think it is
i hope i get some front mission vibes with all the girlfriends and brains
theyre gonna highlight the blonde chick among the main three going under the knife too much it seems like just from the novel summary
unicorn and banshee sealed away/disassembled  phenex confirmed more or less also intact after the ending  i guess pic related is a teaser for uc2
  hopefully itll be the hot mess which is so crazy it loops back around into being good again instead of just being hot garbage
  makes me wonder why the narrative version of the phenex hasnt gotten an hguc unicorn mode release yet
  i mean sure the gold is crap but if it keeps the hg cost from ballooning ill consider it a fair trade
zoltan is the first char clone to not have his ms painted red
  white and gray is the new hotness for char clones
  zechs
  only the nips here  if there is any can say at least for this year
    oh look a notunicorn
better written mipha  they saved ritas brain  the viper reference that wouldnt die
  welp that beats faggot pink and blingbling paintjob
  wonder if indeed they just slapped on psycho frame from a disassembled rx0
  considering the unicorns in zeons hands that had to have come from the banshee
  epyon
  the unicorn is in zeons hands
  silver bullet is a fucking death flag also it is too bulky for my tastes
will gundaminfo on youtube show this tomorrow
i have hated and will continue to hate it from here on not because the plot is a series of newtype and cyber new type bullshit because lets face it gundam hasnt been a franchise tied to realistic combat doctrine since amuro had his first newtype flash and could just sense enemies coming to attack him the plot and mechanics behind the battles in any gundam iteration are written so atrociously that to care for any of them is to give precedent to one instance being an underachiever which is just not possible given the lenghts the series will go to to allow its protagonists to win bending the laws of reality time space and physics are all a simple inconvenience for a gundam protagonist so who in the fuck cares how convoluted the plot gets itll reach its destination no matter what and no matter how fruitless that goal is    what annoys me about narrative is the blatant lack of creativity given to it we have a sequel to unicorn right here which gave us the kshatriya jesta delta plus sinanju the list goes on and this iteration gave us one new mobile suit every other design is a retread of an existing design as far as fan approval and merchandising is concerned and it very much is concerned seeing as gunpla is the key focus of gundam as a brand theres no reason to care about narrative as an entry why should anyone care about a sinanju stein with some extra markings or a phenex gundam with some tails or a jesta with a new haedpiece an as far as the jestas with new weapons are concerned frames arms kits and 3rd party kits exist to fill that very role    you couldnt even cal narrative a cashgrab because it doesnt even reach those levels its just lazy through and through seriiously other than narrative gundams existance who gives a fuck about gundam nt and its entry in the gundam franchise because its added one new thing and will be remembered for that and that alone
  only the first 23 minutes
    tldr go be a contrarian faggot somewhere else you dweeb
  baing a cobtrarian would be trying to argue that gundam isnt a franshise propped up by its model kit sales i hate because it introduces only one new design to sell and is therefore redundant in its existence
  whats the one new design the narrative gundam itself is just another nu gundam msv if thats what youre referring to
  masks ms only used red as an accent unless you count his mack knifes reddish purple
  kshatriya  watered down queen mansa    jesta  souped up jegans    delta plus  hyaku shiki that can transform    sinanju  sazabi with less chunk and no funnels    unicorn was just as unoriginal as narrative
  to be fair they are all very cool designs and besides every mobile suit takes inspiration from the previous ones but you dont see guys shitting on the geara doga for looking similar to the zaku ii the delta plus in particular was rad its a shame its pilot was a fucking bitch and got her killed after like one sortie
  /m/ is populated by contrarian faggot hes in the perfect place
  what annoys me about narrative is the blatant lack of creativity given to it  how the fuck did you go into this not expecting that it should have been blatantly obvious
  narrative gundam is obviously a new design hell the only parts shared between the nu gundam hg and the narrative hg are the knee joints and the polycaps everything else is entirely new      being influenced amd descended from a design is not the same as being a rehash of said design the jesta shares no common traits with the jegan nor does the kshatriya with the quin mantha narrative however features a silver bullet equipped with a beam magnum 3 jestas equipped with specialised equipment phenex with tails attached to its shields and the sinanju stein with a bunch of stickers saying the two are in any way comparable is just being facetious for the sake of it
  its becoming increasingly obvious that nt exists for the same reason build fighters exists an excuse to shit out old molds with a new coat of paint under the guise of a new design except unlike build fighters this time they didnt even have the decency to make most remolds a regular release wonder why
  but you dont see guys shitting on the geara doga for looking similar to the zaku ii  thats because the geara zulu exists to kill all the subtlety of zeon being space nazis       being influenced amd descended from a design is not the same as being a rehash of said design  im pretty sure it is especially since the ovas retcon shit so that the gm sniper ii is the basis for the nemo and the alex the basis for everything leading up to the gundam mk ii so yes rehashing a design is the same as being influenced by one    kshatriya shares no common traits with quin mantha  funnels wing binders and chest cannons arent common traits    the only difference between the two is size and the fact that kshatriya has a fat ugly gelgoog face instead of a gundam looking one
wasnt there supposed to be a trailer for hf at the showings of nt is there any talk in jp land
what i dont get is why design reuse or modifications is somehow bad when narrative is the most logical use of it there can be    its right after unicorn so having an entire new generation of mobile suits would be dumb as hell and everything being prototypes/leftovers fits in with how its kind of going to tie a bow on an era before moving on
  what the fuck are you smoking newtype shit is why people like gundam
  the only difference between the two is size    that and the fact that not a single piece of armor is shared between the two how in the fuck can anyone be stupid enough to compare the similarities between the kshatriya and the quin mantha to a sinanju stein with sleeves markings and phenex with tails how fucking stupid can you be to make the leap that the two are comparable
  at least give us cool variants the ones in nt are pretty pathetic i mean one is literally just a jesta with a stark jegan backpack
  little known fact not everything carrying the gundam brand identity actually exists to shill plastic      most things sure but not every thing
  a serious question is there a single animated gundam entry that hasnt existed to shill gunpla sure manga doesnt have to but thats a dime a dozen and has no real impact on the franchise
  the one the tristan came from
  all of its designs were sold as gunpla they sold shitty yes but thats why it was produced as a series of shorts no matter how little the tristan and zaku 3 sold they likely made a return on investment
  pretty sure banagher went to go fuck minevas brains out after unicorns ending
  this theres a reason why zeta is the most talked about uc gundam series apart from 079
  depends on how you view shilling if showing mobile suits doing cool things constitute a shill then yeah im drawing blanks but last i checked the ms igloo series didnt exactly go 11 making models out of each and every niche or experimental weapon showcased per episode so id argue that was done more to showcase cool shit for cool shits sake rather than to make money off of plastic sales
  mc literally uses his dead girlfriends as stand attacks    yes because zeta gundam definitely did not do this
  how does this explain the unicorn being in zeons possession
  igloo was made as a display piece for the gundam museum they didnt even originally intend to sell it standalone on video
  it doesnt    the unicorn and banshee were dismantled as a joint effort between the federation and roz each side getting an rx0 to dispose of the newtype voodoo was too much for both sides    and then it turns out another rx0 is on the loose you can see why everyones scrambling to capture it newtype voodoo is some crazy shit
  phenex confirmed more or less also intact after the ending  im sure its pretty much gone for good after turning into a true newtype and disappearing at the end similar to what happened to amuro char and almost to the unicorn and banagher
  presumably banagher would have immediately gone with mineva and her people not returned to the federation to hand off the unicorn then find his own way back to her
  unicorn is confirmed to have not been dismantled but kept in a storage in a secret location only known by mineva according to nt novel spoilers so its definitely not the last of were gona see the unicorn gundam
    anyone who was with unicorn or banshee during laplaces events pretty much are wanted by the feddies at end of unicorn sleeves probably want their princess back for their defacto cause but it seems she wants nothing to do with it our best guess is they went into hiding or the actual zabi faithful zeeks are aiding them
  gundam uc2 takes place in the future post victory and is just unicorn again but instead of the charter the laplaces box is the location of sealed away unicorns
  well at minimum theyre supposed to be mothballed
  oh yeah then gself stomps all of them within seconds fucking mask and his pathetic pathetic attempt to use a gphenex
have fun boyz
  this looks wrong
   so its definitely not the last of were gona see the unicorn gundam    i mean theyll need a way to make afranche char eventually
  this was previously announced as pbandai but wheres the logo itd be funny if it was now a retail release considering how lackluster the apack is
  epilogue of the novel just got posted     looks like phenex fucks off towards the center of the galaxy
this is going to be great
has the hathaway trailer leaked yet
  be honest with me this movie is gonna be stupid isnt it
 banagher retreated back into the cockpit of the silver bullet and gently released jona turned the craft around and jettisoned away    banana is the pilot of the silver bullet    and its also revealed that zoltan was a cyber newtype a failed copy of full frontal and upon finding out goes apeshit on a suicidal mission against the feddie fleet
im happy
  its not even evening in japan no theater has even played nt yet wait a couple of hours
  oh fuck theres geara zulus in it ijm happy too hopefully we get an mg out of this ill settle for an re/100
  nah i think hes right twilight axis was just an experiment to see how se jun kim fared outside of being animation director    he was the director scripts mechanical design character design and key art
  thats not the only reason he went apeshit roz was planning to abandon him and the remaining sleeves to the earth feds basically pining all the blame on them
見てきた 感想    ノリは完全にuc uc楽しめた人なら楽しめる  作画はucに比べるとあんまり良くない まあuc2の前座的内容だからね  どうも悪い意味で宗教的すぎる気がする オカルトパワーはガンダムのお約束だし別にいいんだけど  永遠の命だとか死んでも魂が存在するので死は怖くないとかそんな昔の宗教みたいな話するなよなぁ  イデオンソードのse使われてて草 どんだけイデオン好きなんだ  ネオジオング2は派手に暴れまわりまあ満足出来る  コロニー落としの描写やグリプス戦役の時の地上の描写など今まで描写されてなかったものが描写されてるのは新鮮でオモロい    結論 ガノタなら1800円出して見る価値はある ただ歴史に残る大傑作ではない
psycho frame has been confirmed to be idionite
  all of its designs were sold as gunpla    so they were all retools or repaints and only 4 kits were made 3 being pbandai    they didnt go out of there way to animate an ona to sell 1 kit retail
seems that nips in twitter like zoltan   あとヴィラン役のゾルタンは最初から最後まで徹底した狂人なので好感でした   he is fun because he is complete madman from the beginning to the end
    caring this much about story in some chinese robot cartoon with glorious nippon jedi analogues instead of just being happy you get to see robots fight    i bet your mom still picks you up from the arcade
  he is fun because he is complete madman from the beginning to the end  this sounds great i hope hes batshit unstable
  fuck i wish arcades still existed
  kshatriya shares no common traits with quin mantha    yeah noooooothing at all
    
  mineva and banagher are going to reenact gsd ep 13 in one way or another
psycho shard can tap into a higher dimension  able to communicate with the dead and mess with time/universes history  phenex has traveled too far to setup a bigger scheme for the coming of turn x  hathaways death is only a beginning of a much bigger plot    sunrise has everything planned
  lets just hope it organically leads to f91
  and then then it will finally reach crossbone not high hopes just tiny sliver
  gundam hasnt been a franchise tied to realistic combat  see this right here read it then realize if you wanted that shit this was never the franchise to get into and you fell for the its real robot meme retards spout
  epyon was pretty red my man
  see the novel spoilers finished  banahger says even so  holy shit kino thatll make /m/ rage i for one welcome the return of banana
  ok
  so when exactly is this coming out its already the 30th in japan right now
  lmao dis nigga
    schwarz if you count him harry rau and neo if you count him as a char at all since his suit was purple graham only used a red suit for an episode or two at the start of season two too
  he didnt have to get it painted red it wasnt his suit to begin with and it was already red    besides when he used epyon he already threw away the zechs identity he was using his peacecraft name      lancerow from gundam x didnt either
  what the fuck is wrong with edgy char
  ggay
the 25 minute preview is up on gundam info now    fuck i dont think i want to watch it without being able to watch the rest for months
just watched the 25 minute preview     this is what passes for movie animation now i swear unicorn was smoother than this and even then its a far cry from the revamped visuals of the zeta movies     that said the pacing feels incredibly off like its all going too fast     on the narrativehur side of things i find it amusing how literally intertwined the militaryindustrial complex has become at this point of uc the federation has no real power anymore do they
  the federation has no real power anymore do they    i mean kinda the point given the ending of unicorn and whats going to happen after this    the federation is running on fumes and just waiting to fall over by this stage
  the end has zoltan first show up and god    hes so over the top i know hes gonna be great      i find it amusing how literally intertwined the militaryindustrial complex has become at this point of uc the federation has no real power anymore do they    i was thinking about that too the federation already has a secret operation to catch phenex but at the same time luio  co manages to scratch up the narrative break out a federation maximum security prisoner mid transit shooting down and/or killing guards in the process requisitioned an efsf pilot in the form of jona and seconded a cruiser to base their operations out of    theyre straight up getting militarily bullied by a corporation that has connections
  thus creating the conditions which allow groups like cosmo babylonia to thrive
  thrive  well buch concern is building up wealth and connections now but they dont even last 10 years after their declaration
  kinda weird seeing banana in zeek suit
so mc wants to fuck blondie ghost  purple guy got cucked so hard that he turned gay  black haired chick got cucked and salty
im kind of relieved that the nothing changed after mineva revealed the contents of the box stuff from the story summaries isnt quite the case      although i was also a little confused on one point michelle needs rita and the phenex yet was repeatedly calling for jona to use the high mega cannon on it
  although i was also a little confused on one point michelle needs rita and the phenex yet was repeatedly calling for jona to use the high mega cannon on it  i think since the phenex is shrouded in the blue psycofield its expected that the high mega cannon probably wont destroy it
saw the movie today and it was a 5/10 honestly felt like a weak send off to pre uc 100 content also the hathaways flash pv was balls just him sitting on a beach up til the last couple seconds
  they do if you look in the right places like japan or if you want english games singapore
  alright now would you mind spoiling the whole movie for us im not looking forward to waiting half a year for br rips so a detailed/small summary would alleviate that alot thanks in advance anon
more sorray demo   more unnecessary bullshit magic miracle gundams shoehorned into uc only to be mysteriously forgotten by the time f91 rolls around  you bet im going to fucking hate it
  i just watched it    i liked it aside from the shitty character designs
     more unnecessary bullshit magic miracle gundams shoehorned into uc only to be mysteriously forgotten by the time f91 rolls around    i will never get this complaint psycoframe miracle magic was always a thing that had to be forgotten before f91 because chars counterattack proceeded it
  any scenes with marida even just a cameo or a mention
  so im not 100 on everything as my japanese is pretty fucking weak i understood roughly about 40 of the movie and between me and my friends we kinda just pieced everything together so theres a high chance to be a number of inaccuracies    jona michele and rita are fucking young when the colony drop happens and due to nt hax when they hold hands they see sydney just get fucking destroyed scene shows close up people just getting vaporized and shit the flash backs largely consist of the gryps conflict with them in a nt research facility where they put a bunch of kids through the ringer to see if theyre nts michelle pretty much sells out rita to get a deal out of the place and in the luio corp thinking she can rescue rita and jona later well that fucking didnt work out as planned for her the 0097 parts start off with jona using a special ntd suit as he has low or zero nt ability which then allows him to make contact with the phenex and hear ritas ghost voice zoltan turns out to be a reject from the full frontal project and is an edgy boy because people call him unwanted trash zoltans neo zeon force meets jonas group in a colony and they engage in battle with zoltan just blasting away in the colony rita in the phenex senses jona is in trouble and dbzs her way to the colony and starts to job zoltans sinanju stein michelle and her fuck boy servant cause the narratives ntd to activate and goes after the phenex until zoltan decides to call in neo zeong 2 to fuck them up narrative senses the psycho frame of the neo zeong 2 and hijacks it before zoltan can enter it phenex now free from the barrier of narrative stops jona from going berserk in it and they leave zoltan decides to go on a rampage in unit 2 and starts blowing up helium 3 and hijacking federation suits with the control wires of the neo zeong jona and rita try to stop it but get hit by an explosion knocking jona out
  not that guy just got back from watching it i liked it    unicorn stopped the general revil mobile suits at the end of uc by turning back time for their generators to a point before they were even assembled    psychoframe mobile suits can now just wave their hands and shoot out shockwaves that slice shit up    its claimed that the unicorn and banshee were dismantled and sealed away but near the end minerva just looks at the unicorn covered in tape but otherwise perfectly intact    phenex fucks off totally intact now with two ghosts inside instead of one    there was no hathaways flash pv    cameo from the zeta fighting titans in a flashback taking place during chars dakar speech      she says that if it could be destroyed that easily they wouldnt need it
  no marida but zimmerman and bana are in for a couple scenes      climax michelle sacrifices herself after being a lying cunt with bipolar the whole movie to save jona narrative gets fucked up and blasted to pieces but jona uses the core fighter to escape and make his way to phenex we have a literal fucking final 2 ep of tv eva scene with jona michelle and rita banana appears briefly in a ms with a beam magnum to blow up a zeong arm and that pull jona out when phenex starts to grow wings to stop a mass helium 3 explosion that zoltan tried to cause before he dies you find out that michelle jona and rita needed to be together to make use of their nt powers in the eva scene
  a lot of ideon sound and visual effects       a lot of this is wrong/incorrect/incomplete  jona michele and rita are fucking young when the colony drop happens and due to nt hax when they hold hands they see sydney just get fucking destroyed  rita is the only real newtype shes just showing the other two the visions    michelle pretty much sells out rita to get a deal out of the place and in the luio corp thinking she can rescue rita and jona later  the chinese demanded the titans hand over the real newtype michelle overheard the guy in charge saying that he was planning to hand over one of the others and keep the real newtype for themselves so they can figure out how to make real newtypes michelle tells jona that they plan on handing the real one to the chinese and persuades him to reveal that rita is the real one before that they were hiding it rita gets experimented on and michelle goes with the chinese     zoltans neo zeon force meets jonas group in a colony and they engage in battle   this was the chineses plan to get the two psychoframe ms sinanju stein and nt to resonate and bring the phenex out of hiding
  phenex   starts to job zoltans sinanju stein  lol  girls cant fucking do anything in gundam
  i didnt hate it i enjoyed it for what it was but it was on the weaker end of things for sure motivations for characters felt weak the plot was fairly weak too and then certain characters felt animated really weirdly such as michelle at points
phenex is also observed moving at close to the speed of light      climax michelle sacrifices herself after being a lying cunt with bipolar the whole movie to save jona  the entire movie is her dealing with her guilt regarding rita and jona
    theres no to in between job and zoltan there so id assume that means shes kicking his ass the context implies it too
  tldr  is a stupid faggot gotcha
  rita is the only real newtype shes just showing the other two the visions  really i thought michelle was the real newtype judging by the nt novel and she basically snitched on rita because she wanted to get out and was sort of jealous that jona having feelings for rita
  to be honest the thing felt very peripheral and more of a thing to get rid of the phenex that they had lying around as side material the phenex going out of control during a test is literally the thing they had at gundam front some time back but it does talk a lot about the nature of newtypes and the psychoframe it is literally ideonite like fukui said in interviews before    feels like its cleaning up the phenex and setting up unicorn 2 unicorn is fine banagher and zinneman and mineva are hanging out in magallanica etc more than anything
ive only watched the preview but i actually think they improved the cg  making phenex so fast and just able to throw around newtype beams works better than the awkward cg stuff unicorn had i thought
  didnt read the novel but in the movie rita is definitely the real one she was faking her predictive newtype powers by just using statistics and getting secrets out of people
  the cg is pretty decent but the action itself didnt stand out that much    the phenex is cool though i didnt want to go build another damned unicorn type but i think ill go get one after all
  no marida  god im so fucking mad now 0/10 wont watch
oh and they call the unicorn psychoframe tech a technological singularity the unicorn itself is now called singularity one
  correction unicorn and banshee together are singularity one
the psycho shard doesnt show any of the supposed reality warping feats from the interviews
hf is after this right how are they going to lead that to uc2 im so confused
  nt is nothing like phoenix hunt i guess they might redo hathaway completely it was a sequel to the novel version of cca which is nothing like the movie anyway      its used to compress the helium 3 and throw giant tanks and at the very end the shitty korean punk band boys ghost nearly compresses/detonates all of the helium 3 presumably using it but then again the psycho shard got damaged before this so it might just be his ghost
  nt is nothing like phoenix hunt  thats because they arent phoenix hunt is separate from nt and serves as prequel about the federations secret operation hunting down the phenex
  thats because they arent  arent what    durrrrrrrrrrrrr phoenix hunt is prequel to nt    phoenix hunt takes place in the novel version of unicorn where full frontal never got his neo zeong because rita got jona to help her to blow it up middelivery
  so ghosts rita and michelle are inside phenex and jona is the one left behind
  also its mentioned that the neo zeong technology is made with crazy shit that nobody understands that full frontal chars ghost made on his own    i dont get how char would know how to make that stuff but whatever i guess
also the nt gundam does nothing particularly impressive or significant jona gets into the phenex at the end
  ff shit from the sazabis psychoframe dumped into his brain so who knows where his knowledge really came from beyond the time perhaps
to the anons that watched the movie i didnt quite understand what happens to rita she sacrifices herself
  as long as we get banshee norn ver 20 everything will be great    jesus its perfection itself
  also the nt gundam does nothing particularly impressive or significant  there goes any reason i had to even watch this
  how fucking stupid can you be to make the leap that the two are comparable    oh i dunno i guess ive just paid attention to gundam long enough to know recycled shit when i see it    fucktard
so is rita just a disembodied brain in control of the phenex or is her body in there as well does jona also become a force ghost does the phenex go green ntd awakening
banana is perfectly fine and gets to pork audrey every weekend    poor daddy dozle
  banana is a fine boyfriend hes not zeon but hes not feddie either dozle would probably approve of him    its that riddhe guy that dozle would dislike
  except the kshatriya is half the size
  only unicorn 1 is singularity one
  the unicorn covered in tape but otherwise perfectly intact  mmark sein
  irrelevant its still a rehash of mantha just like sinanju is a rehash of sazabi and unicorn is a rehash of nu nothing in unicorn is original it never was
  michelle admits to faking in the end
  unicorn is a rehash of nu  nigger they dont even look alike
so any idea how they are going to reasonable explain how they are going to dial back all the pyscoframe suits with magic as we start to get into the f91 era
  so do nips love or hate the movie was the movie theatre packed i honestly want to ask them why they like unicorn so much
  michelle is also concerned that theyll learn theyre being handed a fake
  easy the federation eventually gets too spooked by the tech and outright bans it with full on incarceration and imprisonment for even looking at information about it    it isnt even that far out there numerous nuclear topics and other sensitive info is actually blacklisted like this in the real world
  she legit states that she wanted to save them later thats why she made them say it was rita it was a lie to cover a lie because she knrw rita was real
  thats already been put into motion by ywilight axis that enemy faction was cosmo babylonia precursor
  rita and all
  no shit /m/ is going to hate it its been produced after 1990
i see quite a few people pointing out how weak the animation was compared to unicorn or say chars counterattack
i dont know about you people but the spoilers itt sound more entertaining than unicorn which outside of cameos and references was boring at best
  rita is a ghost michelle kills herself to power phenex up with her ghost yes phenex turns green jona remains human and banagher takes him along      the pamphlet says unicorn and banshee together are singularity one      pretty crowded most reactions ive seen so far is people saying they were expecting nothing so it was better than they expected
  yeah the animation isnt really much the phenex is kind of cool i guess its nothing to look at compared to other stuff its not bad but nothing exceptional
poor hobo gundam does nothing extraordinary then gets ditched in favor of waifu phenex  cant make this shit up
also there is no time travel whoever said gundam phenex was going to have time travel abilities is an idiot
  the time thing was probably referring to the unicorn when theyre talking about it early on its mentioned that the thing it did to the general revils ms was seemingly turning back time on their generators to before they were even assembled
  character animations are tv quality tier should just hired whoever made unicorn ova
  the entire movie seems low budget
    its out
so how does this movie debunk the newtype myth exactly
  if you saw someone claim thats what the movies about you were talking to an idiot because thats clearly a mistranslation of its ニュータイプ神話の行き着く先 destination of the newtype myth    the destination is ghosts
  it doesnt  basically tells you that the pure form of newtype is precognition they can predict events before they happen they cannot change the future regardless amuro char kamille judau had underdeveloped newtype powers but strong enough to improve their machines and become more skillful than veteran pilots their minds were always 2 or 3 times steps ahead of time
  rita is a ghost  blue destiny style trapped in the machine
  why did they feel the need to bring this back of all things why couldnt this just stay dead
  yes but less shitty
  completely contradicting the line from the movie i think youre misinterpreting the pamphlet since your japanese isnt that good after all
  seems she became a true newtype fukui previously wrote that char and amuro became true newtypes meaning that their physical form outright vanished thats why the sazabis cockpit was recovered it was used to make full frontal but chars body was never found because the cockpit was empty rita likewise just vanished the phenex is still under her control and she speaks to jona and michelle but when he gets into it later the cockpit is empty       the storys based on a novel about the phenex fighting the neo zeong
  seems a lot  better  than than the trailers made it out to be   mc appears to be a better betachad than banager at least
  banana  confirmed newtype  not feddie  quick thinking on his feet with decent physical ability  goodnatured engineering student  saved mineva several times in a row  hes dozleapproved
  being a true newtype means transcending the three dimensional  i honestly dont mind this development
this nerdy ass nibba humming mozart on the bridge   realistic portrayal of 5th generation zeon larpers desu
  kinda of a shit deal to be honest in order to be a true newtype you have to essentially die
  you so that now but wait till some writer takes it to the logical extreme and has amuro or char hijack a psycho frame suit out of nowhere
  not even half the size kshatriya is like a third of the size at most
  how so limitations of the body
  youre also cursed to live forever as a ghost beyond time
  has amuro or char hijack a psycho frame suit out of nowhere  didnt that technically already happen in gundam unicorn at the end with full frontal
  thats the basis of abrahamic and many oriental religions
  no when the fuck did that happen chars spirit left full frontals body and it became an empty shell what else happened
so how come narrative gundam doesnt have a 360 degree cockpit monitor even jegans have it its year 0099 people nt gundam already out of date
continues to live  saves the new protagonist   continues to fuck mineva every day while jona loses both of his waifus  i hope banana haters apologize after this
  not meant for combat since it was for attaching parts to test doesnt have one
  narrative takes place around one year after unicorn
  its old ass test frame they repurposed from phoenix hunt
just watched the preview personally im 100 fine with the time manipulation fuckery and i feel like it has the possibility to be very entertaining as dumb as it is on paper to me its a breath of fresh air these uc wank shows and ovas have desperately needed after unicorn i stopped caring about timeline consistency canon and all that so i do not care how stupid it may get     on the other hand i dont like how rushed the first half of the preview felt the scenes did not flow together at all and it felt like big chunks of story were completely skipped over thankfully it slowed down as it went along i hope the rest of the movie will keep the pace down
  phoenix hunt  is that and the 0094/0096 manga still canon
  i think skipping the earlier stuff to benefit the latter fights will pan out well maybe   theyve given the audience enough information on who jona rita and michele are why theyre hunting unit 03 and why its important
i really do not like how incredibly rushed this story is they do nothing to explain anything what is phenex who made it how can its existence be scrubbed if they had teams of people working on unicorn and banshee why wasnt this explained in unicorn ova they is no build up at all just throwing shit in your face and dont come at me with that knowitall you should have read the manga attitude bullshit the anime needs to stand on its own
  c h a d  h  a  d
  i liked the preview a lot outside of some of the typical bad anime dialogue choices and exposition dumps the story is pretty straight forward and looks like it should wrap up nicely  i just hope that zeon edgelord isnt too much of a fag and ruins the story
  this guy is either a shitposter or just retarded because all of that is explained very clearly
  they seem to be going full camp with the zeon edgelord   ive got a good feeln about this scoob
  phoenix hunt is in the novel continuity so has nothing to do with the shows       this guy is full of shit
  this is a retard who didnt watch the movie
  no hathaway preview  is it at some specific theaters or showings  someone else claimed there was a preview that just consisted of hathaway sitting on a beach
  narrative is a prototype nu
  nt isnt in phoenix hunt jona has a stark jegan there instead and its not a prequel its the novel version of the events where rita and jona fight the neo zeong and take it out before it can be delivered to full frontal     where the fuck is this stupid shit about it being a prequel coming from
  its only certain theatres and they didnt say which the official tweet now has dozens of replies complaining about it     
  i just hope that zeon edgelord isnt too much of a fag and ruins the story  hes definitely the worst and weakest part of the movie
      units in the same development line  not looking the same  youre retarded  of course the kyshatriya is going to look like its predecessor thats what most of the new unicorn designs were  advancements on existing uc mobile suits  this is how technological development happens  macross does this eva does this eureka seven does this the military does it    you obviously dont know what rehash means so dont use it
  lol
  it is  unicorn the series was stupidly expensive  they did that because it was the first uc series since the 90s  after that there wasnt really any reason to keep up animation quality like that      the pilot literally cant handle the g forces of moving in that suit  its why he had the super bulky pilot suit  theres no way he could use a 360 degree cockpit without breaking his neck
  mmmmm yes 5 minute explanation dont think too hard about it no world building required now buy the models kids
  why wasnt this explained in unicorn ova  iirc they mention this in the unicorn ova somewhere
  buy the models kids  no shit what did you expect from gundam anon
  are those actual spoilers or are you pulling my leg man
  i expect to be taken out to dinner at least a 12 episode ova first before getting taken to bed clearly youve just bent over and opened yourself wide for bandai
  psycho shard can pull the ghost in whenever the pilot wanted the dead can exceed time so it can bring knowledge of futuristic skills and technology to the summoner by in story rumor someone has used a shard to bring knowledge to build the unicorn and neo zeong  that also hinted how snri got the the ai ar and ca living in the f90s
  phenex was never mentioned in the ova
  at least a 12 episode ova  stop living in your fantasies anon its not the 90s anymore  12 episode ovas dont happen  youre retarded for going into gundam and expecting something like that  its a media franchise thats here to make money not your favorite anime
  what the fuck am i even reading
  tractor cockpits are the future
  if 00 gundam can get two whole seasons and a movie then uc can do it if ibo can get 50 episodes and a garbage ending then uc can do it if greco can even be made then uc can get a decent season     i cant believe you supported animated garbage like twilight axis with its 5 minute episode nonsense you dont belong in this thread
  dumb shitposter
  thought you were talking about unicorns in general but they do say in the nt that martha witnessed the incident where the phenex went wild and that it was scrapped from all federation documents    so given that information we know that  1the unicorn 03 had existed for a while now  2martha knew of its existence  3she is also one of the key people in the development of the unicorns and specifically banshee  4martha is a shady person who was willing to do anything necessary to keep her hold on the federation    so the conclusion is    marthas responsible for the development of the phenex but something went wrong so she had all evidence of its existence wiped out  yes this means she probably had people killed    its simple deductive reasoning anon youre suppose to use it and pay attention when consuming media  anime is literally one of the simplest forms to interpret since 90 of it has simple dialogue that spells everything out for you
  you just said you wanted a 12 episode ova form uc and now youre making comparisons to shows that are 2550 eps with wildly varying quantities and qualities of animation    stop being retarded    and i didnt support ta im simply stating the facts of what gundam is as a media franchise  youre definitely underage or stupid for not being able to get that
well at least narrative was as i expected shit
  no its not its just an ms that tested varius equipment packages they actually removed all nu gundam references in the model kit manual and edited the ms profile on the official website
so when is banana going to impregnate mineva
  sounds more like sunrise is just depending on chump fans like you just like modern star wars fans to fill in the gaping holes in the storytelling so they dont have to put in effort into making a solid story
  not that anon but i think its not too much to ask to have narrative gundam be extended a bit more it does feel a bit rushed
  im sure he already did
  i watched the first 23 minutes just now and there was a bunch of stuff that i didnt like
  you cant its racist
speaking of unicorn whatever happened to this faggot last i checked he was still alive in both the novel and the ova
  went to newtype lab and became zoltan xd
  is the nword narrative or newtype
    merely an inferior copy of federation desing
  stacking dosh for buying out the buch concern
  muh name is basra  basta what  basta deez nuts  gets slapped
   neon zeon
  psycho shard could allow newtypes to talk to the dead they can use the deads nt power to access stuff from the future and bring it back to his/her own time by using the deads power the newtype can also undo things or rewind the clock with his/her imagination
  mfw after watching the preview and reading this thread    thats it  it became the straw that finally broke the camels back for me  no it wasnt the newtype sex dream of 0079 dead newtype gf ghosts of zeta attack of 50 foot newtype aura of zz asteroid moving after everyone dora the explorard it in cca slide show called twilight memories and banana literally doing a kira yamato in unicorn that really made me rethink my decision to pour time into a toy commercial disguisdd as tv series no  it was fucking this movie that made me sink a bit and realize the mistake of my life for ever opening that ep 1 file of 0079 with my media player this plot is as retarded as nth super secret gundam prototype shit they pull in oyw side stories now they are pulling nth secret newtype shit and this shit isnt going g to stop they will milk unicorn to the point where they will show banana walking toward those victory gundams laying in snow during the final scene of victory gundam  this us why i never got into star wars endless trash
  well the mcs look like a bunch of faggy faggots so of course i hate already
  anon i understand how you feel but maybe you should lie down for a bit
  looks ok i guess cant say that it oozes creativity doesnt even feel like it has any underlying themes worth noting
  iim not dumb yyoure just a fanboy    honestly im not surprised you didnt get it  people who watch anime tend to be a bit dull when stuff isnt explicitly spelled out for them  this is mostly animes fault though for setting such low expectations  you should probably try other forms of entertainment that arent chinese cartoons  itll help you become better at understanding stuff  entertainment inst always just braindead material you stare at sometimes you have to put in a tiny bit of effort to understand    what i typed up in that post was a process that went through my mind in a few seconds i just extrapolated it  your mind does the same thing everyday but you dont even notice it  we calculate millions of pieces of sensory info a second without focusing on it this is just a little step further
  i was just messing with him because he was being autistic  id like to see longer shows like that but for what narrative is doing a movie is fine for this kind of story theres not much theyre trying to tell    at its core its a love story about a guy trying to catch up to a girl thats moved ahead of him just set in the universal century    if narrative fails at telling this in the span of a movie then its the fault of the staff  gundam hasnt had any good narratives for a long while        the nt abbreviation in narratives logo is a double entendre that can stand for newtype or narrative they did the same with unicorn and universal century
  imagine getting this upset over a show for kids     i wasnt excited about this project when it was first announced and i wasnt too impressed with the preview but you are on a whole different level
  nt  for kids       lmao kys
  can stand for newtype or narrative  yea i know i was just playing along
  it honestly feels like a show for kids between this and divers it feels more like gundam is trying to appeal to the shonen crowd
unicorn and now nt make me realize just how much i dislike the the newtype stuff in uc i mean it was always there but it never bothered me since it was just one aspect but these two shows specifically feel like everything in them revolves around newtypes
  what take you so long  its all spiritual shit done by fanfart when tomino refused to define newtype in a more specific way
  was just one aspect but these two shows specifically feel like everything in them revolves around newtypes  haha yea 0079 zeta and cca in particular all were so subtle in regards to newtype magic lol
  no offense to anyone who likes the idea of newtypes but i never liked them and their existence always bothered me even when i was first introduced to them when watching msg i was happy watching a science fiction show that didnt have concepts like transhumanism psychics magic super humans ghosts espers spiritualism etc not every damn science fiction show has to have that in my opinion    this does not mean that i hate gundam
so is the bd releasing at the same time as the screening like with uc  or its standard theatrical release with bd next year 
  xd
  well anon if your life wasnt so sad that you live it through chineese cartoon for kids then you wouldnt be so frustrated right now  cheer up douche bag its just a cartoon about robots not a masterpiece level work of art no need to get worked up about it
  newtypes were a major facet of uc gundam from the very first series the fact that they are focused on by the time of unicorn and nt is the natural progression of things especially after an event like the axis shock
what was this idiot thinking
  man you know how to trigger me because posting that and not the long goose might as well be sacrilege
  thinking    clearly he wasnt thinking at all
  nobody asked for this nobody went and said to themselves gee i sure hope that somewhere in uc there was a super special loli that could predict aaaaall the bad things that ever happened for a hunch of jews thus undermining everything amuro ever did
  so becoming a newtype is essentially the same thing as becoming a force spirit in star wars retaining your consciousness in the wake of your physical death     i guess it makes sense spatial awareness in humans as they are is limited to themselves and interpersonal communication characterized by sensitivity to raw and underlying emotional and physical cues the awakening of newtype potential more or less being a conscious mental extension of these senses transcending distance is a logical next step the identification of a fully realized newtype being the conscious expansion of the mind beyond the bounds of time and space  and indeed the physical self  should indeed be the final form     i like it i can see why newtypes pretty much turn into myth and legend after all this their full potential was realized through the deliberate enabling of their powers and it scared people enough to suppress the idea from the collective consciousness of humanity     more of people being afraid of what they dont understand
  yeah the animation quality looked like something out of a typical tv series so it does seem like the bosses at bandai didnt want to give them a proper budget to work with    as for the federation being such pushovers thats probably more the writers not really being all that great either that or then its completely intended as the japs are kind of zeek fanboys seeing how zeon was originally written as an analogy of the axis powers in ww2 and we all know which side they were on in that conflict    im from a country that was also part of the axis powers finland but even i dont see much on an appeal in them it just reeks of bad writers trying to make the main protagonists more heroic and the villains more menacing than anything else the titans were supposed to be an elite unit but apart from a few characters they were all pushovers so its not like they didnt fall into this trap early on and even aus have had more than their share of federationstandins be complete pushovers to make the main characters look more heroic and the main villains more menacing hell its as much of a trope as space americans vs space nazis thats in all too many gundam shows
  by f91 the feddies have gotten so complacent and weak that they still use jegans thirty years after chars counterattack and they give up colonies to cosmo babylonia like its nothing i think this portrayal of an increasingly weak federation is inline with what comes after where no real opponent to feddie power leads to a weakening of their military strength and increasingly amateur pilots
  the thing is they dont need to progress it  theyre doing a lot to explain newtypes and thats super the wrong move    as much as unicorn gets shit for newtype hax the one thing it did right was keep things super ambiguous the only concrete new newtype power we got is psychokinesis tied to psycoframe with the shield funnels everything else was left unexplained
  again sounds more like lazy and/or incompetent writing trying to make the villains look more menacing by having them be so much more competent than the other major faction could also be the japs still raging about how badly they lost the war they started against the americans seeing how the federation has always obviously been space ww2 americans
some quick questions for anyone whos seen the whole movie ive seen the unicorn tv show and just finished the nt preview     is riddhe still around what happened to him    what about noa    where was phenex during the events of unicorn     unicorn and banshee are still around at the time of nt but are just collecting dust
  phenex does and phenex pleases
  tomino let it get out of hand at zeta  i liked the idea of newtypes being a far off thing that humanity would achieve in their future  having them pop up all over the uc is really weakening their meaning
what did fukui mean by this
  having them pop up all over the uc is really weakening their meaning  fucking insane killing machines is the only meaning
this sounds way more superfulous than i expected so its just showing off another unicorn type and another neo zeong seems weird to make another movie just to set up the same showdown the powered by dead things certainly isnt new ether
  since dozle was a newtypei think so based on his space bat aura does that mean he gets to watch his daughter have sex
  he wasnt a newtype that was merely the projected essence of his own malevolence from amuros perspective you know how newtypes have an inherent sense for peoples intentions
  a biosensor alone can do that i assume a psyco frame would be enough psyco shard seems excessive
  surprise its actually a miniseries that they cut up for a compilation movie before releasing the series itself uc worked out so well for them doubledipping on the same content that they set out to do it from the start
    riddhe doesnt appear but we can assume he is still with minevas faction   noah bright and the londo bell are not involved in phoenix hunt but well obviusly see him in hathaway flash  its unclear if the phenex hybernated during the events of unicorn or just jumped ahead in time after it went berserk the latter explanation is not so outlandish anymore  according to top secret reports unicorn and banshee were disassembled but we later discover that at least the unicorn is just sealed and still in possession of minevas faction
the first 24 minutes were amazing    waifu pstd  dude gets stomped  you are playing with a dangerous fire  narrative vs phenex  mc gets slapped    gonna be hard waiting for bd
apparently the first 23 minutes were uploaded on japanaese youtube dont have a vpn atm how is it    
  its literally been posted in this thread retard
    just go to the gundam info youtube channel its even subbed in english
   sorry    thanks ill check it out
a lot of people in this thread seem to be acting like this powered by the dead/newtype force ghost shit is a new reveal this shit has been well established since zeta zz seemed to even imply you can go newtype ghost just from being sufficiently comatose too
    what did you expect the modern gundam fan only knows of the franchise as a toy commercial having dismissed the storytelling aspects as garbage not worth paying attention to at best and an insult to their intelligence as plastic connoisseurs at worst    that and to be fair if your first big wakeup call to the universal centurys more spiritual aspects is psycoframe voodoo the likes of what nt is establishing youre going to probably have a very bad time judging by the average preferences of /m/ anons theres a certain critical mass of quasimagical weirdness that a lot of people dont take all that well to i find
based banana
  thanks buddy
just wait anons im sure build divers season 2 will make you guys happy for once and redeem the gundam franchise for you
unicorn is just sealed and still in possession of minevas faction  further proof that mineva is turning out to be like some pink haired princess of some sort
  that little dictator she should be removed of her world
  aoz has better faithful mech design progression than the official thing    cant make that shit up
please dont talk shit about audery thanks
  why did they feel the need to bring this back of all things why couldnt this just stay dead    the shit the neo zeong pulls and the scale of destruction it nearly enacts at the end of the movie is what makes people finally decide this psychoframe technology absolutely must go away now not the phenex
  too bad all the kits are pbandai
srw weapon  go back in time p 
ill be honest the first 20 minutes look like something ive already seen a dozen times before what i dont get is how anyone can still spend money on gundam i get that you kinda wanna watch it and therefore are fine with wasting your time but how can anyone seriously justify spending money on this shit its so utterly repetitive and bland nothing feels creative or even slightly original whyd you pay for this let alone blow money on merch
  obviously gundam isnt for you so fuck off and get lost
  how anyone can still spend money on gundam  toys 
  banagher is literally kira yamato veruc
  until unicorn 2 comes out and we get the neo zeong remnants which is just the original neo zeong with sleeves markings
rita clones replace purus  oh boy we have a plot for uc2
  aoz was never really too out there when you look back on it  a lot of the designs were just the hazel or woundwort  external equipment based on a random titans suit    and the other designs were zeta designs with slight changes like the gundam mkii  barzam
  let alone blow money on merch  he doesnt own 50 gunpla of the strike and rx78 with slightly different armaments  why are you on /m/
  to filter /gpg/
      i think you guys are right  i was getting too worked up on this   i shouldnt be surprised for it being made gotta have to keep printing money   on a second glance this and unicorn are maybe be sequels to cca these feel so disjointed i can ignore them totally  old stuff is still there after all
  i only own mg hinu verka mg double x mg phenex and mg ingram and i like narrative so far
i liked the teaser    what does it mean
to those who watched it  whats the explanation to neo zeong  how was it destroyed was the fight cool
  being contrarian makes me cool  gtfo
  /gpg/ is halfway to bump limit after more than 2 days i dont think youre part of a majority anon
i havent watched unicorn should i watch that before this
be uc elitist  shit on destiny for making seed cast steal show from the new cast  banagher literally outshines the mc while the mc loses both his waifus   all this happens while mineva keeps unicorn for under their mansion like lacus used to hide the freedom    this is really coming full circle
  yes since thats directly after unicorn ending
  but anon ucfags claim for everything since cca to not be canon anyway
  defense mechanism  ftfy
  whats the explanation to neo zeong  it was made using spare parts but thats all ive got
  definitely watch unicorn first im actually a little surprised at how not standalone this seems     it definitely assumes having seen unicorn as a minimum arguably it helps to know some of unicorns nonanimated background stuff too
   uc2 starts with riddhe becoming a bodyguard with an alias
  thats been the plan for years  bandai did the math and realized that most people who buy kits are old and greasy they want fresh blood age failed ibo was okay but theyll keep at it until they get it right
does hiroyuki sawano enzeekay know he cant actually speak english
  hi i am john pterodactyl
  further proof that kira yamato type gary stus still sells like hot cake
  yes  does anyone cares no  is there heaven woooaaaaah
  100 this    anyone who is bitching about muh magic is purposely being autisic if they dont realize that gundam has always been a superrobot show just more lowkey about it than mazinger or something i have absolutely no problems at all with them introducing stuff like this
  put your trip back on
isnt michelle a little too eager to destroy the phenex considering her whole motivation is to capture it intact
  elitist doing the lalalala i cant hear you     unicorn is just the seedification of uc
  faithful mech design progression  right because mobile suit bits are so fucking faithful to the tech levels of zeta they were so fucking good at the time with newtype tech and incoms that they could build fucking mobile suit bits how come that never showed up on zeta or zz or even cca
  it was made with spare parts and and with the internals being held by zeek spite
  not intact they just need the torso marida also says it during the original unicorn they dont need the whole suit just the main part and the phenex has two really fucking strong ifield shields around it and can generate the axis shock at will
soooo when do you guys think well be able to see this  im not even couting hd release but a camrip is unlikely right
  arent mobile suit bits only from the au gundam x series
nevermind me im just here wanting a robot damashii of sinanju stein and phenex in unicorn mode   i feel alone
  not looking the same  except for the parts that got pointed out look the same    you can say muh technological advancement all you want but its still just a fancy way of saying rehash and if you look at it from a meta perspective iethe only correct one youll see that its all literally just the same shit with different names and serial numbers slapped on    sorry your dumb toy robot show exists to uhsell toys and add nothing else of value to your pathetic wasted life
  holy shit no ive been dying for a unicorn mode phenex rd for years fucking anime line taking up all the slots    i really hope we get an awakened phenex out of this to complete the trio bandais produced more rds of unicorn and banshee than i can count so i dont understand their reluctance to milk the mold further with phenex
  sorry your dumb toy robot show exists to uhsell toys and add nothing else of value to your pathetic wasted life  pretty much like all mecha anime
  how can anyone seriously justify spending money on this shit    why do people collect waifu figs or model trains or video games hobbies are a normal human thing does your robot brain not have such a concept
  yeah i did really liked the unicorn mode especially after todays video  never understood why ms like rozen zulu and delta plus never got rd treatment
  look at this monstrosity
  
  exactly its all dumb shit and this board is stupid for liking it still
  
  if you hate everything about this board why are you here
        wow ive never seen those before which series are they from
  its because she has nowhere else to go anon
  advance of zeta the series that is so fucking faithful to uc tech evolution that it looks like au
  to be fair about 60 of the stuff in aoz was either locked away at konpeitoh and never saw combat or combat readiness or just existed on paper
  nope the titans went and defected to rezeon and brought all that shit with them and rezeon is now mass producing woundworts
  my  wishes   over   their   airspace    proceed to drown in sea of cunnies because you are a hot japanese pretty boy
so narrative is another treasure hunt    the hunt for time travelling capable machines
  its amazing that the federation managed to exist even on paper until 223 how
  if we get more stuff set in the third century uc we might see a resurgence of it the timeline fuckery would certainly explain turn a
  oldies are goldies
luio corp were allies of the aeug    the original dijeh was a oneoff custom machine modified from a rick dias for amuro maybe the engineers were somehow associated with luio corp then or later
  could it turn people back into fetuses      they will probably rewrite hathaways flash to include more mobile suits rather than just gustav carl vs messers
  titans went and defected to rezeon  this will never not be funny
  the earth fedearation as a whole wasnt even that bad by the time of victory they just had their hands full dealing with the economic crisis
  what about noa  who the fuck calls him that
  survive intact  bang space princess    truly the most successful uc protag
  eh not really the rise of cosmo babylonia had little to do with the opening of laplaces box in fact laplaces box did very little of anything to the federations power that was their horrendous management financial irresponsibility and general lack of concern for whats going on in space
  theyre just continuing the tradition
  ditched grimgirde for fucking muh bael
guess its about time someone repost this    also know as nyaa recovery thread    previous thread      old links        various mirrors                  recommended anime torrent and ddl sites                        volafile  org/r/bfwgl2 request obscure anime here    ftp servers are still dead

  gundam reconguista in g episode 26
  people revisit the ruins of jaburo after it was nuked to hell in the gryps conflict i think v gundam went back to jaburo for a bit too
i guess arr posted the baldios series subs i dont think ill grab it to mirror considering the licensed bd set comes out in a little over a month
werent there some raijinoh and/or wataru dlls four or five threads ago or am i making shit up
was there a lotgh bluray remaster announcd not too long ago i keep thinking there was one that was going to be done off of the master tapes and filled in with laserdisc upscales where there was damage
  wataru    i was able to get it all from  flbpybiwb5rzwvzz3x1dqghuu8awukq      if you have any gaps ping here or on the vola    raijinoh  this seems to be it  
  thought there was a mega or something for the entirety of wataru on bd maybe i was just thinking of that shin wataru link thanks though
bamf
is there a torrent for all of the dancouga stuff
  this should be a complete ddl set               i can also vola these as needed    the pastebin in op has a few of these in higher/alternative quality   ffbku3azadjrc_2pvz0iubznyffupsa huge 138 720p raws  retimed subs   f0twhcsbcl0j1b9l_mrpa8srgacxygw nova   f6bahytrrif9tktkuqieu4_lodxi_dq ovas and extras in 720p

    excellent thanks lads
are there subtitles for albegas arbegas if found some raw of what i think is dvd but no subs i know there were italian dvds released a while ago are they available somewhere
  i just noticed that the gundam seed hd remaster mega link in the pastebin doesnt have episode 14 why is that
  only the first episode by arr      clipshow recap same thing with episode 26
anyone got betterman
        
why cant i find the last three episodes of dorvack
  they only released the batch on ab i can upload them when i get off work
anyone got the five star stories movie
   upload will be here whenever its done
          the ed is only 480p but ill stick it on the vola
  well the first two links are useless to mei refuse to torrent something over 500 mb that doesnt have at least 5 seeders cause i do not have the patience needed to torrent something longer than a couple hours and i have no idea how to use that kametsu link the third link isnt worth a shit either as its only 480p so this really sucks    its times like this that i really wish nagano would get run over by a bus so that the fss rights can get sold to someone who isnt an idiot
  ftp servers are still dead  this hurts so much
    okay im really starting to see why no one uses irc to download stuff anymore its fucking slow as hell to the point of being absolutely meaningless as a method of file distribution
  that sounds like a conclusion derived without sufficient data    some bots are fast and some bots are slow edmashiro can do like 20mb/s fakeetzimal is like 300kb/s right now but the connection also keeps dying ive got about 60 of kagura the five star stories bdrip 1868x1078 x264 hi10p flacmkv 56gb after a few hours    your patience must scale with your desired quality
  your patience must scale with your desired quality  thats actually the problem i have incredibly little patience anymore for slow download speeds unless its for a truly huge torrent and that one bot i was getting maybe 20 kb/s max for it and it kept dying    not to mention i got kicked from the channel for no reason whatsoever
  i dumped the 5gb 1080p version on vola its raw though so be sure to get the srt too
  i dumped the 5gb 1080p version on vola its raw though so be sure to get the srt too  thanks ill be sure to do that where would i find the srt
  right next to it in the vola bin the mkv has subtitles embedded but they are japanese why
  thanks hadnt checked the vola yet
does anyone have a cobbled together full set of subbed gunparade orchestra gunparade march is already in the bin    looks like it mostly exists as slightly overlapping hardsubs from conclave and anclassic with softsubs from getbackers for the last two episodes

how come nobody uploaded eps 4 and 5 of battlogue in english anywhere should i go to /wsr/ and ask for someone to put those on nyaa and anidex
  just sent horriblesubs an email about it lets wait for the response
hoping this isnt a stupid question but does anyone know where i can grab the soundtrack for the gundam movie trilogy in particular
      this archive somehow survived originally made by marty i think     in the gundam folder there is the cdbox collection with the movies and series ost
  thank you kindly
just taking in the sights of my favorite museum
trider is now being uploaded on kissanime 
  its times like this that i really wish nagano would get run over by a bus so that the fss rights can get sold to someone who isnt an idiot    youre blaming nagano because youre too stupid to know how to torrent a film he wasnt even involved with
    does anyone have download links to knights  magic and ibo
  knights  magic      
can some more seeders reseed the original 1970s devilman anime         thanks
    thanks
not exactly /m/ but does anyone know whats in the yugioh zip in the vola archive is it the manga or the 98 anime that has green hair kaiba
  yeah its the hi10anime rips of the 1998 anime   sample  hi10_yugioh__01_480p_tnmkv
  ah okay thats a shame id have loved a quick and easy way to grab all of the mangaespecially if it included r as well
anyone have a mega for mazinger z crabstick version        
  neat
  hylia has ddls of encoded eps and ive put up isos of all but the last disc
forgot to say but who is reponsible for the pastebin i request this link gets added    might not be video related but having a /m/usic archive would be good too
im looking for uqs release of ideon if anybody wants to upload it to mega or a similar site
did anyone rip the official dunbine release with new subs
  alright thank you kindly
  last 3 of dorvack  thank you for this god ive been so frustrated not being able to get these dorvack has been one of my grails heres hoping someone does galvion and srungle soon      did anyone rip the official dunbine release with new subs  very interested in this
could somebody please seed the mazinger manga
  nope
  just download it from here old torrents arent really that reliable also you really should state which mazinger    
  just mazinger the first the only one you have in there are shin and god
  its at the bottom in the mega titled original mega download
    has arr continued to release more stuff on animebytes id hate to miss their releases
  yes they announce most of what they upload as they do it  theres a few things i plan to grab during the next ab freeleech including trider g7 tetsujin 28gou 1980 and jeeg the ab yen pool is about 3/4 the way there which means it could possibly be near the end of this month / early next month
does anyone have hardsubbed mp4s of the 0079 movies  i need it for a thing and mkv wont do
  check the vola in a bit  hi10_mobile_suit_gundam_movie_i_480p_eg_hardsubmp4  hi10_mobile_suit_gundam_movie_ii_480p_eg_hardsubmp4  hi10_mobile_suit_gundam_movie_iii_480p_eg_hardsubmp4
  thanks a lot
i had a hard drive die on me 4 gigs of anime toku cartoons comics audiobooks music and other media lost yes smut too    might be able to recover it but i think its time to invest in a raid
  4 gigs  and by gigs i mean terabytes derp
  nightmare scenario always keep 2 copies one offline the vola has been helping someone for the past few months who lost about 5tb of anime ransomwear but almost fully recovered by now did you keep a list
    raid is not a back up its meant to provide availability when a disk fails but doesnt do anything to protect against other forms of data loss
      thanks for the input guys    sigh constantly backing shit up surely there must be a better way
  the best way is to make sure family friends and strangers all have lots of copies    unrelatedly can we send you 4tb of mecha anime
  sigh constantly backing shit up surely there must be a better way  theres really not but it honestly isnt a pain in the ass unless you constantly adding or removing a lot of data  in most cases youll be fine with just one offline backup that youll keep in your house/apartment/whatever if youre truly paranoid you can keep a second offline backup at a friend or family members house you can switch it with your primary backup once a week or month  i personally recommend getting a usb 30 or better enclosure that supports uasp im currently using an amazonbasics one and its been great but im pretty sure its just a rebadged orico one so theyre probably fine too  just make sure you stay away from shingled drives once you need that much storage is when you need to start looking at raid solutions since shingled drives have awful write performance
cr just announced theyre removing some ultra shows does anyone have nops ultraman 80 somewhere
  i did keep a list yeah thanks for the thoughts    well disc failure has been my main problem so    heh here uncle charlie hang on to this hard drive it has tons of anime on it  but yes 4tb of mecha anime would be most welcome indeed rebuilding my collection hopefully wont be necessary but if it is    shingled drives
  well disc failure has been my main problem so  keep in mind that hard drives from the same batch will typically fail around the same time assuming theyve gone through the same wear and tear combine this with the fact when youre rebuilding the array youre puting all your drives under significant stress the likelihood of another drive failing during this critical period is fairly high so at an absolute minimum you should use raid 6 sou you could handle up to 2 drive failure this one of many reasons that genuine back ups are still the best option against data loss  heh here uncle charlie hang on to this hard drive it has tons of anime on it  unless your friends or family members have any reason to suspect that you have illegal shit on it theres no reason for them to give a shit about it since it can just sit in a closet or some other place that would be out of site  shingled drives  
  i think i might remind me about it if i dont follow up in a day or so
on the trail ive found max so far
okay seems like this hard drive has nops max a dub of 2004s ultraman the next a few eps of ultraridergorizards mashup of the 7 dub onto the hd video and a match between ultraman and sabu    im dumping some stuff on there for an hour or so from here so ill check some more drives later
does anyone happen to have some subs of the giant robo ovas brain powerd or overman king gainer ive been looking all over for them but no dice or the seeders are dead     heybot too nobody seems to seed them anymore
  are you looking for the videos with subs or just the subs    ive got the dual audio exileddestiny for overman king gainer that has softsubs that can be easily extracted    i also have the rather rare dualaudioxvidam for brain powerd from yuu_matsuura fserv on rizon but that has dvd subs that when extracted are sub and idx files    can vola em
  subbed episodes than the subs itself i meant it doesnt necessarily have to be hardsubbed id actually appreciate softsubs if you have them you can vola them though    and thanks
  okay will queue am brain powerd and ed gainer after current major s16 batch check vola in a while    both are soft subs which can be toggled onoff and are not part of the video but the am softsubs are from a dvd rip which means they are pictures subidx rather than text srt ass etc
  giant robo ovas  found the g_p of giant robo the animation  the day the earth stood still 17 and giant robo gaiden ginrei specials 13 dual audio dvd rips 6gb volaing
ive found evidence that ive downloaded their leo  might not have 80 but ill keep checking for any nop releases
bamf
looking for ai senshi zxr by richie kotzen cant seem to find this album anywhere for download
odd how when i decided partially out of boredom one day to search every vocal song from probably every /m/ show from 1963 to the endish of 80s with some 90s sequels the only tracks i absolutely cannot find are from dorvack of all things    if somebody has ai no yokoku and aoi yasuragi from dorvack music collection ii  shout out please      
  thanks also hope you upload that collection somewhere
man all ive wanted since it came out a year and a half ago are panzer world blu ray rips and still no dice on that the fuck are yall pirates doing    inb4 buy it yourself i might at this rate
did the god mazinger anon ever receive those weird subs
bemp
  any of these subbed the pastebin ovas qts seem like theyre not
  the nonmega stuff is all softsubbed drax except the msubs blazing epilogue which is hardsubbed mp4    you can get the huge msubs softsub version from    
  it wont be anytime soon since there is always something i forget besides the tracks in question being sometimes hard to find    defenders of the universe contains the golion dairugger and albegas tracks why the name think about it for a second
  sneaking suspicion that i probably shouldnt have dropped this show
  im just looking for the original harlock series i dont want to watch it online also is there a genocyber bluray coming out in the near future i vaguely remember /m/ talking about it in some older threads but it could be nothing
  harlock    ep 13 is broken there so rapidgator  net/file/04761197a30bd6aa901a9ae343a60ea3 too
    did somone have the the bd box of dancouga with sub  because i remember it being subed but i dont find it anywere
anyone got the g gundam ost download link is dead
     
  this will take a bit of time but at least its there any other place i can find the original series maybe i have everything else except for it thanks anyway ill get to it tomorrow
  yeah the aumi captchas are ghoulish i could dump them on the vola for you it is slower but no captchas more options    xdcc          slow ddl  
  there are retimed subs for the qts raws
  thanks but it seems that the /t/ thread with every anime by decade had harlock in it as well in the 70s folder i looked there first but i thought nobody was seeding it after having it stuck at 0 for days after a forced start its definetly moving downloading galaxy express 999 and the og yamato seasons too along with some of the 60s stuff which is weirly included in there as well sorry to trouble you before trying everything with that torrent first have a great day
anybody have the mega link for the msubs of dragonar
is there a torrent for all of the biobooster guyver stuff    i dont think this was entirely subbed
bamp
      
okay ive bumped this from page 9 or 10 the last three times in a row is anybody else still here
  yeah i still check in from time to time we appreciate your efforts
anyone have a good batch link to old newtype magazine scans anything 80s would be amazing
any big magnet links i got 4tb i dont know what do to with
anyone have the chamelenia hkdvd rips 0147 of the brave express might gaine with filenames like  yuusha tokkyuu might gaine tv  ep01 chamelenia c49c607cmkv    i can find crappy hardsub pdsg 0128 and nyoron subs 0106 as well as some huge something or others at  with softsubs but the chamelenia look like a good file size and consistency
anybody got raws for all the old sd gundam ovas
  thanks dorkly youre the best
has anyone ripped the official garo bd release
almost everything gundam has been taken down from thehylia where can i find nontorrent downloads for 00 and build
  why the hell find nontorrent downloads anyway
    because either you grab an episode the day after it airs or youll never find seeders ever again and if it has a lot of seeders then youre stuck downloading from 19 people uploading at 1kb/s
  there arent enough people seeding gundam  leave youre a joke
    then step right up to the punchline i dont know about uc but more modern stuff has few to no uploaders
    i am deeply grateful to this thread and its continued existence im the anon from  and yeah my 8tb is deadsville     luckily the only stuff i didnt have copies of elsewhere were the movies tv shows cartoons tokusatsu and anime work communications portfolio audio smut and a buncha other stuff were still hanging around on other drives    i have a lot of stuff to get back but thankfully none of it was truly vital or irreplaceable and thankfully this thread exists
  i can record them from my lp copies if youd like do keep in mind though that they wont sound 100 clean since im busy editing other lps right now
  yes go ahead if you can its all mp3 so it wont be 100 sound perfect anyway in my limited audio knowhow at least
does anybody know if chou kousoku galvion has been subbed
  only the first episode 7 years ago
  anyone
bump
  gimme a couple of days and ill see what i can do
  thanks will look foward to it
ab is going to be having their freeleech in the next couple days ill try to grab most of the arr stuff that hasnt been mirrored yet trider g7 jeeg tetsujin 28gou 1980 and throw it on vola or whatever to help spread it around
bamp
  no pressure but mega would be pretty neat
lets work together to keep the museum open
  i agree i want those old sd gundam raws
anyone got that metal heroes monster art book cause unfortunately desuarchives search isnt working right now
  doing some search with google on yukila which is way less precise than desuarchive search found this thread it seems said book wasnt uploaded yet    
  its definitely been uploaded i remember seeing a mega link to it multiple times often as the opening post for a metal heroes general
  but even if it was uploaded        the problem now would be finding a working link
ab freeleech started last night  trider g7 is uploaded to the vola in op working on jeeg next
  keeping alive for trider and jeeg
  do you think you could get the seed destiny compilation movies while at it
  not the same anon but i have the dual audio as versions  as_mobile_suit_gundam_seed_destiny__movie_01__the_shattered_world__rs2_7fc521d5mkv  as_mobile_suit_gundam_seed_destiny__movie_02__their_respective_swords__rs2_aeabbfcamkv  as_mobile_suit_gundam_seed_destiny__movie_03__flames_of_destiny__rs2_2bdc3db1mkv  as_mobile_suit_gundam_seed_destiny__movie_04__price_of_freedom__rs2_50311684mkv  ill queue them on the vola will take about an hour
  awesome if the subs turn out bad who do we blame arr or their editor
  according to the editor he never got footage to work with for most of the episodes he subbed for arr which sometimes results in dialogue that is supposed to end in an ellipses as a hyphen to indicate interruption barom one was the worst example the rest are passable then there are editors notes jeegs got one at the end of episode 29 which questions on spoiler territory and the last episode thanking everyone one of the late episodes of baldios thanks for releasing something that would have hurt discotek sales arr had a note about music in history which he even referenced here when he pulled his subs trider has two both as unnecessary school lessons with this being the less stupid
  tetsujin 28 1980 was also released by arr but unlike those two it is not on kissanime
which version of zeta has the symphonic suite as the op i originally saw the show that way but always encounter it with the other op presumably the original and havent been able to find a way to single out the version i want
  brah the original zeta openings are better than zeta itself dont settle for the bullshit censored ops
  thanks
does anyone have a dl for zmind
  ed dual audio mkv xdcc    also queued to the volas    ila dual audio ogm        crap avi  
  here is the other one
  of course the vocal versions are the original what gundam series has ever just had an instrumental for an op they just ran into licensing issues so they used one of the shows leitmotifs instead    seriously heres op1      and heres neil sedakas original  
  so they used one of the shows leitmotifs instead  they also added a bunch of pewpew noises like robotech
are there any better gaogaigar final encodes than the ones on nyaa i thought i remembered seeing way better screenshots of final than this degrained oversharpened mess    talking about the first couple episodes of course i know they switched to digital at some point
does anyone have toei devilman its not in the pastebin
    i have the  0choba set i could vola but is this mecha
  why not its go nagai shit
  there is a loophole for devilman the toei anime at least    curious fact the license for this movie has been in use in srw games since forever but only to use the 2 mechabeasts that appear in it mostly toros d7 blagger s1 only got used in a couple of games
  nagai stuff is generally considered honorary /m/  and if were including it because of crossovers and spinoffs theres also devilman vs getter robo
  and of course devilman saga
    volad

this took me longer than it should have but here are some of the insert songs from the 2nd dorvack ost      need you guys to do me a favornothing over the top i promise does the audio in the two songs sound balanced    the right channel in my lp recordings tend to be louder than the left channel because of the position of my cartridge which i havent been able to fix i usually just resolve this by increasing the volume on the left channelthis has been working so far and i was going to do the same with these dorvack songs but strangely enough the two songs already sound balanced without me having changed anything what do you guys think
  sounds balanced over here even after swaping earphones positions then again i dont think i have the most acute hearing around so other opinions would be welcome for comparison    also finally thank you tons this collection is now mostly almost complete
  god damn man how many tracks is that im super envious
  720 vocal tracks so far all mp3 because finding flac or similar audio format for half of those is pretty much impossible    well 719 not sure if khamen khamen from braiger counts as a vocal aside from some narration at the start
    the waveforms look pretty balanced one side seems maybe like 12 louder in most places but then notice like at the end the other side swells
can someone upload the ahq version of seed  id like to be consisted since seed destiny is ahq
  thats fantastic
  post the megalink
i am remuxing albegas using the raw dvd video and the italian audio i managed to finally get my hands on the italian god sigma dvd but the video quality is not that great are there jap raws around judging by the albegas ones it looks like the did some remastering the ones on nyaa are dead i am going to try and denoise them a bit but i am no expert at that    also does anyone have any advice about dvd ripping for older anime i have the adobe suite and know more or less how to use handbrake i get around 300mb per episode with good quality in h265
  dont think these exist on any mega vola means volafile the link of which is in the op    i originally got these 0choba rips from  but the links are all dead now and the torrent  is unseeded the only live source left seems to be     there is an alternative on nyaa   the newer bluray rips which are severely inflated in filesize 700mb/ep for 720p
  having trouble finding it the torrent  is dead and their xdcc bots ahqx and kerbster have been gone for like a year
  you can do it anon i believe in you
anyone got a dl for gasarakis dual audio bd rip
  was there a bluray news to me
  could have sworn there was but maybe that was just my imagination
  nevermind i managed to get one episode from the jap dvd rip and its terrible
bbump
so other than ripping more vhses which is off the table at the moment what other shit am i forgetting to do
while md geist 1 and 2 are not really listed as mecha per se i think ill throw my hand in to make sure more classic stuff doesnt get lost to time and has clean rips        this is md geist 2 death force ost it wasnt available anywhere that i could see so i bought the soundtrack and ripped it myself to make sure it doesnt get lost id prefer someone else host it if possible though as im never sure if ill need to get rid of any files in my mega at some point
    noice thank you for this
bumpin
did the original kamen rider bds ever get subs added to them i remember hearing some talk of that a while back
  nope did we ever even finally get bd rips of it
does anyone have a link to the fss manga
  chapters 0127 are on madokami but you probably dont have access so ive stuck them on the vola
does anybody here have the godannar release by aa animeanarchy i have the release by exileddestiny but the fucked up their encode by making it 640x352 even though the dvds were anamorphic widescreen  ive looked everywhere for the aa since it seems to be the only 480p release according to anidb but i cant find it if anybody here has it i would greatly appreciate it if you uploaded it to mega or similar
does anyone have a complete batch of bioman that i can download
   if you dont mind individual downloads
  please is anyone willing to upload dhd kagaku ninjatai gatchaman tvova to mega
yuichi hasegawa non gundam manga
does anyone have bd rips eg fatcat cxraw release of the original ultra q original monochrome version is also included in those
  only dancouga burn was translated afaik          bit of a shame considering he put out enough /m/ manga to pull off his own super robot war    im not wellversed in manga authors so did hasegawa made the most /m/ manga or there is another author
does anyone have any raws for volume 2 and 3 of buster dress id like to see if i can get someone to translate the rest of it now that its ended
  volume 2 is translated vol3 is halfway there is someone doing it but last update was 4 months ago    
  thanks    sorry i dont know he did a lot of scifi manga and they are impossible to find on internet except for some
  ah so what ive seen already then id really love to read the rest its one of my favorite mecha stories in a long time a shame it seems it was ended prematurely according to the official twitter
can someone download the sage bd version of age and put it in a mega link  the sid one is pretty crappy
does anyone have a dl for the 720p bd rip of crusher joes film my media players are stuttering hard on the 1080p rip and the dl on nyaa is dead
  
why the hell was all that stuff taken down from thehylia
  i just glanced at a random show and it looked like its there what stuff got taken down
  there is some stuff taken down mainly music i think glad i got those gunbuster vocals before that
  oh yeah they have music too lol  i always used tenshi i forgot hylia had music
  tenshi
  tenshispbru
just a heads up not really worth making a new thread daitarn 3 is soon getting a bd release in italy and it wont be a filthy upscale they said at a recent con that sunrise rescanned the original negatives
anyone got links to the bubblegum crisis ost mp3 version
  
   sunrise showed off the first few episodes at sunfes and confirmed a nip release next year chou wataru is getting one too
  thanks
  nice to see minor shows getting some love zambot 3 was also recently announced
anyone have a 720p rip of mazinger infinity with actual subs applied only one i found on nyaa was 1080 and machine translated
does anyone have gaogaigar in better quality than whats avalible on nyaa  theres only final in the pastebin
  no luck on the 720p but there are better subs here    
bump
  my sincere apologies for bothering you but would you be able to reupload it to vola
  if that was me i cant figure out what version was 5gb without english subs uploading the 56gb kagura now
    this is what i used when i watched it seems better than anything on nyaa from a quick glance
        since horrible subs will never do it would anyone here be kind enough to make mkvs of these and stickem on nyaa
  download them with jdownloader then mux them with mkvtoolnix its not that hard
  anyone could post the complete gall force for a second
  in volafile i meant
    sure thing look for it after not mecha romance of the three kingdoms 1991 currently going up    animetakeover_gall_force_1_eternal_story_movie_f070e360ogm  animetakeover_gall_force_2_destruction_movie_682f23b9ogm  animetakeover_gall_force_3_stardust_war_movie_baf0a6c0ogm  dense the ten little gall force e5f9973amkv  gallforceearthchapter01dualaudioxvidamogm  gallforceearthchapter02dualaudioxvidamogm  gallforceearthchapter03dualaudioxvidamogm  gallforcenewerachapter01dualaudioxvidamogm  gallforcenewerachapter02dualaudioxvidamogm  gallforce1eternalstorytriaudioxvidamogm  gallforce2destinationdualaudioxvidamogm  gallforce3stardustwardualaudioxvidamogm  kotomiodyssey_gall_force_the_revolution_1__war_storm__ldxvidmp3_8dd4c21fmkv  kotomiodyssey_gall_force_the_revolution_2__galaxy_run__ldxvidmp3_e6dfd660mkv  kotomiodyssey_gall_force_the_revolution_3__soldier_plant__ldxvidmp3_74907274mkv  kotomiodyssey_gall_force_the_revolution_4__home_way__ldxvidmp3_a69b54f0mkv  raw_scramble_wars_tsuppashiru_genom_trophy_rally_7382946eass  raw_scramble_wars_tsuppashiru_genom_trophy_rally_7382946eavi  rheagallforcedualaudioxvidamogm
if anyone has the time could they upload these somewhere else i cant seem to be able to get em on aumi  
  ill dump them on the vola after gall force along with the as tv series  exileddestiny_birdy_the_mighty_ep01_32f672b6mkv  exileddestiny_birdy_the_mighty_ep02_212f5ad7mkv  exileddestiny_birdy_the_mighty_ep03_8beeb3eamkv  exileddestiny_birdy_the_mighty_ep04_ab6b72f6mkv  as_birdy_the_mighty_decode__01__one_plus_one__rs2_6c73a509mkv    as_birdy_the_mighty_decode__13__stand_by_me__rs2_bafd5438mkv  as_birdy_the_mighty_decode02__01__after_all__rs2_9a2aed0fmkv    as_birdy_the_mighty_decode02__13__between_you_and_me__rs2_d7c0f4d7mkv    sources were rizon xdcc bots edmashiro and asanimesupreme
looking at arrs live journal and twitter is seems like they got hacked last week guess we can say goodbye to danguard ace izenborg and god sigma subs real shame because a lot of old anime finally got subs this year thanks to them
  ty ill take that extra
  since horrible subs will never do it would anyone here be kind enough to make mkvs of these and stickem on nyaa    alternatively you can download them yourself from literally anywhere else like irc and put it on nyaa yourself      download hexchat go to news and use the edmashiro xdcc bot its extremely fast    a good deal of these requests can easily be solved by taking two minutes to learn to use irc      
  no god sigma subs  why live  i have 48 episodes dubbed but no one ever translated the last two    thats useful stuff senpai thanks
  hey thank you the subs are working and it looks good
anyone got that vhs rip of the mobile suit gundam wing ovas the operation meteor ones that was floating about
  a anon some time ago posted the bd raws for those along with subs    sadly the links to the raws are dead but i got them so i can up them to vola if you like
  that would be very sweet thank you
  uploading now with the subs too because why not
  i already snatched em but ty
/r/ing the votoms ovas
  imma just dump the 40gb folder from weeb on the vola good luck soldier
anybody know where to get ng knight ramune ovas raw gonna contact arr and see if we can give them some english subs
i missed out on the link to the srungle raws  anyone got the mega link still
  i have raws both ovas what about the main series which is still only partially subbed
someone uploaded trizenom episodes  i found this site  but lacks the least 4 episodes
  there are only 22 episodes check anidb mal or the error report on ann
are their any ddls for tekkaman blade bds torrents dont seem to have a lot of seeds
  you can find various sets here       you probably want beatrice which is complete and has english subs      looks like most external links are dead so youd have to log in and use the direct links bit of a pain
bumpatron
this thread is great thanks for the work you guys do
is there a single atv paisen files without hard subs
  for the 12 episode ova the choices are  english hardsubs  raw  polish softsubs  brazilian softsubs  italian softsubs  misc other language hardsubs
  raw    better than hard i guess just get the subs separately somewhere else
testing 4channel
  i saw some urusei yatsura discussion on volafile and i was wondering is there a hd/bd release of urusei yatsura only you with the full 1 hour and 43 minutes the bd releases cut around 14 minutes of footage and cropped too much scenery
  according to anidb all the hd releases that arent dvd sourced upscales are exactly 12957    as for cropping more producers need to realize that 43 and hd are not mutually exclusive sttos and sttng were successfully and beautifully remastered in hd from the original film stock in 43    also this isnt very /m/
  thanks for letting me know   sorry
  the bottom pic looks actually better imho
  i got pretty upset they cut off 14 minutes of footage moreover these bd versions crop too much
    what happened with this i was also interested /
the pastebin mega link to locke the superman lord leon is dead does anyone know what the contents were specifically looking for hsa choujin locke special pilot 1979mp4 and either the sspcorp or apc dual audio of the 1984 movie everything else is pretty easy to find on animetosho
is the animax zz dub still lost to time
how do you really determine the best quality for a series for archival purposes     as in reading up the forums  eg is a better encoder than ozc but if the encoder is unknown what else would you consider
  someone took the g_p subs for ggg and put them on the bds
bump
    very bumpy indeed
can someone post an active download link or upload the whole subbed episode of might gaine found only 28 eps in nyaa    also nadesico pls the one with smaller size
  might gaine        nadesico  little more complex the ed are good dvd dual audio      ssp dvd sub      hd dual audio big files      and i could vola the legacy release dvd dual audio 250mb 480p ogm
  is there any better quality for might gaine
  uhh no dvd is all we got    and past episode 28 youll only find those hkdvd rips

  piratefags begging instead of supporting legal licensing
  get the fuck out is this what kids today think about piracy
  its about video games but whatever
  supporting a small company like discotek in their effort of acquiring the licenses to niche and often unsubbed mecha shows is literally the same thing as buying into eas lootbox and dlc schemes
    okay as long as theres nothing to improve by ripping my hks cool
      
on the topic of piracy i think the best policy is to buy official available /m/edia if its offered for a fair price dont spend an outrageous amount on old releases sold by greedy third parties pirate anything thats been discarded by the license holder and on the subject of video games if its over a decade old and the only physical option wont see any money to the people that made it just download the rom or disc image and emulate

happy birthday mazinger z
  holy iuck today is the day
am i retarded or is this show genuinely horrible
  aquarion watches better is you think of it as a parody im not sure if that was the intent or not but its pretty funny some episodes like the crash diet one or the evil lake certainly seem intended as comedy but other times the show takes itself way too seriously
  its funny shit stop taking giant robots seriously
  no cross ange was funny shit this is just shit
  its shit watch logos instead
  its shit watch the sequel instead   how is that supposed to work
  evol is the sequel logos is independent think of it as what digimon tamer s to adventure and 02
  its super jank which is either part of its charm or irritating depending on how you feel about it    after all what other show has soccer superpowers or exploding hearts
  it was fun for its time had that early 2000s jank you dont see a lot of anymore    the evol retcon was funny fight me
  i mean it made sense when you think about it but if we bring thinking into giant robots it would suck the fun out of it
i thought it was passable but nothing id recommend
    i thought it was decent
  all i remember from it was the narutotier art for one episode and reika being the best girl
  cross ange is way shittier it was also fun tho
ok i dropped this garbage and continued to watch heroic age instead 9 episodes were more than enough
  youre just retarded doesnt mean that the show is not horrible though
  it is borderline art nothing short of a magnum opus
  genesis is hit or miss evol is worse though
evols issue is that its pretty great for 12 episodes  then descends into something thats just boring  at least it gave us zessica porn
  this man knows what he is talking about watch the first 12 eps and then drop it you will do yourself the favor
  dog plot never forget
a  fucking  dog
  i dont think they are boring i think they are flat out bad which makes the good episodes even more painful
  would she cancel out toumas bad luck
hey /m/ i just read devilman g vol 4 i didnt see that coming do you feel that the ending will take after the anime or the manga
  i dont think anybody cares after all g is trash
g is generic shonenshit for people who cant understand the original
    i liked g and its more shonenesque mainly because it takes after the 70s anime more its essentially it with the mangas sexual and violent style though i wouldnt expect it to fluke us out of it and have another killemall
g has my favorite demon designs
  im interested in it but not enough to buy it and i dont think its been uploaded by anybody i guess i could take a look at the raws but that deflates it a bit
  both makes sense in context
  have you read vol 5 is the mangas ending and the associated consequences not permanent like devilman lady
  what do you mean    unlike lady g isnt supposed to be in the same universe as devilman classic    the consequences inuniverse are quite permanent
  im not asking if its in the same universe but if its like devilman lady in the sense that the consequences get retconned somehow evidently that isnt true given by what you just said and the ending browws elements from both
  the absolute madwoman
  looks cringe
  if you dont know the context why are you calling it cringe and that seems like standard go nagai fare why must you cringe
  so this and mazinger zero are going to be translated and released in argentina soon im from chile but the editorials books and manga are usually brought here so i expect to see both in my country in a month or two later i will get mazinger zero no matter what but for devilman i ask if i want some action with devilman beating the shit out of demons will grimoire scratch that itch  i wonder and fear that they will censor shit like this though  also didnt jinmen killed and raped the corpse of someone in this manga  
  standard go nagai fare  this assuming of course that his involvement didnt stop at take this bag of money and let us put your name on the cover
  gb2reddit ironic weeb
  yeah but theyre already out in englishis it just too expensive
  maybe he just wants to read them in his native language without having to deal with international shipping and with the added benefit of supporting the local publishers
  yes there is a lot of devilman slaughtering demons
  is he sanpei
since were talking about devilman here i might as well ask    i just got the volume 2 of the classic collection but i havent finished volume 1 yet that is to say i havent reached the shin part is there a reading order guide or something for these i could follow
  he was tricked by the fish smell
  go nagai has nothing to do with devilman g other than being the creator of devilman in fact those english credits in op are fucking retarded 原作 does not mean story
  sorry go nagai is responsible for literally every dynamic property related work
  nagai would never copy someone elses work never
  its sad that theyre still doing this dishonest shit 20 years later
  pretty much this in terms of support for example if theres some for shin mazinger zero maybe they will consider the second part vs ankoku daishogun and for devilman maybe they could even bring the original as well this could also lead to other related manga  granted its just wishful thinking and i fear that both will sell like shit because not muh mazinger and too problematic but i would love some of that stuff in my language and being easy to get as going to a mall and pick it up  as long as i can see it here though
  dat art  yikes
devilmiki is so hot
  garbage design
  absolutely
  hol up miki became a debirumang
which series had the bigger impact on the development on anime and japanese pop culture as we know it
  yamato gundam was more of a cult thing
realistically speaking it must be yamato
gundams impact is more or less restricted to the mecha genre so probably yamato
  yamato gundam was big but yamato was one of those shows that really kickstarted the whole thing without yamato there would not be gundam or a whole host of other shows
  the show with the 1/1 scale replica of its main machine
gundam has warped the mind of generations of japanese creators and is still doing it
  ah so yamato
  yamatos had public monuments a lot longer than gundam
  calling gundam a cult thing is silly the generation that grew up watching it are literally referred to as the gundam generation    but yeah probably yamato if for no other reason that without yamato there would probably be no gundam
i think yamato was a bit more influential on anime that came after it than gundam was but the original gundam was still pretty influential but gundam is the clear winner for japanese pop culture because even people who dont watch anime in japan would be more familiar with gundam than they would be with yamato
  people who dont watch anime in japan would be more familiar with gundam than they would be with yamato  i dont know about that the first compilation movie is supposed to have competed well with star wars at the japanese box office and was pretty consistently either on tv or in cinemas for a decade just from the first series through to final yamato not even considering stuff like the live action film or 2199 its been a near constant mainstay of the japanese sf scene  plus there seems to be a new one of these at least every year  
  i am pretty sure yamato is just as recognizable as gundam if not more  if there is a difference in their influence on popular culture it is that yamato has universal appeal especially with its nationalistic undertones while gundam appealed to young people specifically in this sense regarding its influence on the industry yamato established that tv anime can also be an art form while gundam was the harbinger of teenager targeted anime  in addition at least half of the reason gundam became such a huge phenomenon and still is today is its toyline
  yamato paved the way for gundam as influential as the original gundam is it probably wouldve never happened without the former at least not in the form we got it those toyetic gunboy concept designs mightve made it to screen
  considering that it was yamato that was responsible for the socalled anime boom of late 70s and that it was also the main reason for the general public start seeing anime was more than just children stuff i would say yamato     also if we looked for monetary numbers while the first space battleship yamato movie of 1977 farewell in 1978 and be forever in 1980 were the highestgrossing anime films of their respective years with each one raising more than 17000000 only encounters in space achieved that status in 1982 with 16163388 the other two gudnam trilogy movies lost to a doraemon movie in 1981 which raised 15000000 yamato is also in front of gundam in the list of highestgrossing anime film franchises and film series with 67003640 compared to gundams 54569440 those numbers dont really indicate how much one series or the other influenced on japans pop culture but they are a neat bit of information anyway
  japanese pop culture a shit anyway so who cares
  the other two gudnam trilogy movies lost to a doraemon movie in 1981  in fairness thats a pretty respectable thing to lose to that shits been a hit for longer than sunrise has even existed with a much wider appeal
  yamato  normalfag pleb shit  gundam  based obscure franchise for patrician
  the chad yamato  the virgin gundam
the one which gets to be a 2020 olympic ambassador  oh wait
  put them together and you have macross
  gundam isnt obscure
  the virgin macross  the chad robotech
  normalfag meme
neither of them will ever have the cultural influence of tetsuwan atom
    to be fair astro boy is probably one of the most influential anime of all time so its hardly a fair comparison
    how right is this
  you gotta commit to the bit  the super virgin macross  max and millias marriage fails  limps aimlessly as its episode count changed constantly    chadbrotech  max and myria ride off into the sunset a perfect marriage  clear direction and planning start to finish    and so forth
  eva and gurren lagann thumbnail  not watching it
  wrong people dont like mecha because war and shit they dont like it because others dont hope on and watch it its purely because of seasonal bullshit where people want to absorb anime and not actually watch them     proof gridman is doing well because it has trigger fags watching and spreading with their seasonal watchers and creates a following with others samething happened to franxx   samething will happen to  promare      i have no problem with these shows becoming popular its just when they do people do mental gymnastics to justify that they didnt watch a mecha show but a show that focus on characters because wasnt on screen for every frame of the show and the mech wasnt character like optimus prime therefore its not mecha bullshit mal and /a/ argument
  because the mech wasnt on screen for every frame of the show
  it have been quite some time since i watched this video but i remember it being a pretty decent video even if i think he could have dig more information
  i simply dont understand why people go out of their way to say they didnt watch a mecha show why do people do this whats wrong with mecha some of the best examples of anime are mecha fill in blank here with your favorite show i guess
  its the mentality that most people associate mecha with kid toy commercials like the original transformers which i do like and find nothing wrong in it and power rangers/ super sentai people think that mecha is trying to sell toys at all time with hack writers so they find it embarrassing to like a mecha thats not accepted by everyone like eva gurren geass and some gundam shows and even then they feel the need to have those shows not be associated to others ironically theyre inspired by other mecha shows
  its the mentality that most people associate mecha with kid toy commercials  yet they have no problem with shounenshit
  or the idol shows aka buy figures
    yamato nip nationalism at its finest
  or fucking star wars for that matter
  dont bother read this instead    commissioned by japans agency for cultural affairs manga animation games and media art information bureau  its not perfect but most of the problems are little nitpicks and well youre not wrong but sorts of things      fun fact the word ewok is never spoken at any point in rotj it was however plastered over the packaging for the figures the power of merchandise man
  yet they have no problem with shounenshit  its called soft seinen now    those are mature shows for mature people you know nothing
  the levels of fucking delusion in this thread    outside of anime circles or even mecha fan circles nobody knows what the fuck yamato is    gundam is literally in the top 5 franchises in terms of influence and popularity    if you mentioned yamato outside of this board 99 of people wouldnt know what the fuck you were talking about
  what is more ironic about that is not just the current popular shows being heavily merch driven as the other anons already commented but the fact that jap popculture had always being like that in general     this can be perceived by many factors like how the companies themselves create labels and genres often based in consumers demographics by the sheer number of titles in film series like the torakku yarō series had ten movies in five years abashiri prison series had eleven films in three or four years and wakadaishō/young guy series had twenty one films in nine years just to name a few series then there is the overuse of the term boom in their popculture literature simply because is extremely normal for something currently popular to be imitated and repeated until exhaustion like the kaiju boom of the late 60s follewed in the same decade by the group sound boom the yokai boom the sport anime/manga boom the second kaiju/henshin boom the super robot boom space opera boom the anime boom the real robot boom and so on
  tetsujin
  it doesnt have to have been wellknown decades in the future in order to have been powerfully influential gundam brought maturity to mecha but yamato brought maturity to the medium    if i asked a random person on the street what a model t is they probably wouldnt know it doesnt change the fact that it was the first mass produced common automobile
  you are fucking stupid nobody is talking about clueless western zoomers like you  everybody in japan knows what yamato is and it had huge influence on anime and japanese culture as a whole
  heck even some of the major changes in mecha anime history were less due to narrative elements more related to merchandising like mazinger changing the business by instead of promoting unrelated products stamped with the character image or name selling toys directly related to the property which became the norm in the 60s and principal factor the making of series gundam with the model kit hobbyist market in early 80s which dictated the purpose of many series of teh period megazone 23 strengthening the ova market and partially changing the production committees way of finance and commercialize and then eva in the 90s establishing a long lasting way of marketing and sell anime episodes in home video format     but anyway the point i was trying to make is that just because those series and films in general have very specific marketing purposes it doesnt mean that they cant be good
  idol shows are buy cds you retard or go play the arcade game for some series
  not sure if this is a joke or not
  but anyway the point i was trying to make is that just because those series and films in general have very specific marketing purposes it doesnt mean that they cant be good  its always important to separate what the sponsors want to get out of something vs what the writers/directors want to get out of something i dont think tomino gave a flying fuck about clovers toy sales any more than anno cared about dvds and waifu statues when he was making eva regardless of whether they may have reevaluated their priorities once the shows came out and made their mark
  yamato easily
  max and millias  who
  gundam is literally in the top 5 franchises in terms of influence and popularity    you are fucking deluded   cuckdam fags should seriously be gassed

  anpanman has grossed 15bil more than disney princesses
  anpanman way more profitable than doraemon  is anpanman popular outside of japan i live in a weaboo culturefriendly country and ive never seen a single episode
    anpanman is so fucking big theres an entire market that revolves around unboxing and playing with anything anpanman branded for children to watch
        i had no clue so many japanese anime and manga were so big even evangelion i would have thought not to be this massive considering we dont even get a bd release here

  what the fuck is wrong with nips
  their life may suck but they can still enjoy hitting the lever
  my guess would be china they consume loads of anime right  and the rest of it may rely on exports to nonenglishspeaking countries which never really had their own major animation industries particularly the spanishspeaking territories where theyve loved that shit since the 70s
  yes i can see a lot comes from manga and its true that they also have the french italian and spanish market but still when you think how little you hear/see of them outside of specialized circles its pretty impressive i mean even in france or italy where they had anime since the 70s you dont see billboard advertising the new evangelion movie

poor green frame gets no olev
which is the one lowe just gave to a war photographer because he felt like it
what a shitty shitty post the astray spinoff series started with only the three gold blue and red frames dumbass
  thats the astray out frame which is built off of the testament gundam
  gold frame amatsu  still no mg amatsu mina  you think well get the amatsu hana kai for master grade instead of this

    whats the big bad beetleborg
  wow purple looks like ass with those claws im pretty sure it must have a lazy transformation too
  that purple one is cool
  with ces paper thin armor that is more fragile than a leo its amazing they even attempt to call it a defense specialist
  ces paper thin armor  has a ce mobile suit ever exploded from being punched or elbowed once
  cant be attacked if theyre all dead
   make a custom astray gunpla loosely based on the command gundam   command gundam is green   use astray green frame  thats literally all it is
  poor green frame gets no olev  shouldve turned into something if it wanted to be more interesting
so is astray better or at least more interesting than kiraverse seed

igbx immortal group build    build a mecha focused around vehicular racing for a highspeed race across the galaxy    what constitutes a racing mecha   a mobile suit with a focus on speed/agility with or without some sort of waverider/ma mode this doesnt mean bulky mechs arent eligible it just needs to retain a sense of speed to it all racing components must be incorporated within the mobile suit itself and not be an entirely separate entity ie you cant make a mobile suit and a motorcycle but you can make a mobile suit with parts that turns it into a motorcycle or a mobile suit that has armorparts that turns a motorcycle  is weaponry/vehicular combat allowed  yes but ideally you should probably stick to hardmounted weaponry instead of handheld weapons not that you cant include handheld ones its your build the lighter the better in this case  i cant come up with an idea for this theme whats some good inspiration  igpx eureka seven redline wipeout and fzero are good starting points for futuristic racing machines if you have a favorite race car livery then that can work as a starting point as well    submit your entries to gunplaplamogmailcom  include at least 5 finished pics and any wip pics you took while working on your entry    start 11/01/18  end 01/31/19

  apparently fucking tanks are so rules dont matter
whats /gpg/s airbrush of choice for spraying thicker material like primer     the mr hobby procon boy sq looks tempting because of some people managing to spray primers with it straight from the bottle and im leery of paasche    thin acrylics properly  put it in a 05 badger patriot  clogs and doesnt spray right away  put the same paint mix in a damned 02 iwata  it sprays fine immediately  i dont even
  you forgot  break arts  cyber formula  rideback
  imagine being this assblasted over something only slightly beefier than a defence suit
  its dumb racing mecha should look like pic related
  being this mad about racers with tank tracks  anon how does this image make you feel
  shop a guncannon head on it
finished painting last night i like the stark white so much im going to omit most of the waterslides
  even this looks like a better racer
  is that a moon gundam i see in the background
  yep i candy coated the psychoplate but havnt gotten around to painting the whole thing yet
  paints looking thick there
  i dont paint clean builds often so my techniques need practice
  yeah man tanks could never win a race
  
  perfection
  assblasted  not him but if tanks are exactly the last thing that comes to mind when someone says racing
  good gives him another chance to knock you out when you lap him
  if its got any form of a robot mode its fair game if youre just making an r9arrowhead that doesnt transform then thats not really ideal for the groupbuild      i dont see why a tank is so farfetched the build fighters episode with the mobile suit race has people using a garmor a flat and this thing  a loto/r44 guntank style transformation isnt that farfetched for the theme the rules do say   this doesnt mean bulky mechs arent eligible it just needs to retain a sense of speed to it
2019 is already looking like a shit year for the mg line more shit rehashes like the sinanju stein nt and age ii magnum
so this is a thing that happened  facebook page called elitist gundam group got mass flagged by gundamnerds instagram followers as hate speech and subsequently deleted by facebook because the admin there dared to make a post saying the gbwc america winners entry looked like shit  when the model does in fact look like shit  nubmarks seamlines shitty paint and bad overall execution
  i still dont even know what the fuck this is supposed to be
  my guess is the ghosts of war n shit there are little green ghosties at the top
  it looks more like a mannequin christmas tree
  this doesnt mean bulky mechs arent eligible it just needs to retain a sense of speed to it
can anyone id the face used in that monstosity  doesnt look to be fumina at all
  retain a sense of speed to it  where show me where it does that
  dude let it go for fucks sake why are you so fixated on this
popped my cherry
looking over artisan club recasts on museigen are they decent or reputable at all
  believe it or not  the tanks are actually one of the faster vehicles many people then find them faster than they expected
  tanks treads are generally gonna be faster than walking or running in most cases so yeah id say that anons build inspires a sense of speed more than the average suit whats a better way to make a bulky suit that inspires speed than a tank tanks are fucking fast
  its either kira or athrun figurerise bust you can clearly see the hirai eyes but theyre not big and wide like lacus
  recasts  decent or reputable  youre gonna die without a full spacesuit and a class 4 clean facislity
  leopard 2 can reach 42 mph and that was back in the 80s
  your paint is thic af i can see bubbling on the shield  use moar thinner plz
i need to stop being lazy and paint my mg hazel
  oh right  the flip
  speaking of painting i finally have a day off but i still cant decide on the color scheme of the zollidia its sitting here all primed but i cant decide if to go faithful or deviate somehow
  ie heard of sideways but how exactly do you manage this one  please dont tell me you tried to turn your camera sideways to counteract
  default orientation is home button on right side figure out the rest
  hey sydney boy
  probably lives in australia
hey /gpg/  
  erm i didnt have any issues using acrylics in my badger patriot 105 with the stock needle are you using vallejo
  im just wondering when did the white dingo team join the titans
  i use neo iwata trn1 sprays nice and smooth with no issue never clogs or anything  wish i could learn to properly spray though getting better but eh
  no it was rightsideup in my photo viewer  i posted it from my pc     yes actually
anyone else gonna have a gn powered quadruple drive ms for the group build
anyone here built a mg geara doga it looks sort of basic and forgettable in terms of building it but i think painting it would be fun considering the piping is all one bit
  ill shove them on my guncannon if that pleases you
  its really good its way bigger than youd expect too i will probably buy a second one and do it better
hate when ppl take pictures of thier gunpla out in the woods or the mud or the snow or whatever    like it doesnt look like a giant robot walking thru the desert it looks like u took ur toys outside to play
  he doesnt take his toys outside to play  what are you a faggot
  im a girl girls dont go outside

whats a good way to display remote weapons  cant believe im saying this but the original hg sfs dragoons were so easy to pose i just needed some of the stargazers rings and everything fell to place
  try metal wires
  2  1  3
  this is due to the new judging system for this year i put in my model this year at acen and after talking to the bluefin guys they said they wanted to put more in to how a model tells a story with less points going in to dioramas and build quality and more going to theme
  it looks basic  you better watch your mouth boy
  100  a lot for gunpla
  rideback  so a gundam sized fuego that acts as a bike for a gm is a fair game   nice
  most of the people in this general can barely afford a 15 hg even if they can they cant even invest the money into supplies to make it look good
  youre making my backlog feel uncomfortable
  less points going in to build quality  what the fuck
  that pubic hair stuck to the head
  i know how fast tanks can be im in the army them going faster than people expect doesnt change the fact that they are not racing vehicles and the last thing that comes to mind when thinking of racing
is this a joke
narrative gundam is smaller than i thought at least it comes with the mini dendrobium orchis
  doga needs the heavy armament weapon and tanks then it looks perfect
  never even noticed it doesnt come with weapons other than a beam saber too
all in all the type a looks cool if you ask me in a we know the gundam is unfinished so take this mobile armor to make up for it kind of way
  certainly wont beat unicron in term of sales and popularity
  verka when
  admin is so butthurt his little facebook hategroup got shutdown that hes blaming an asshole on a different social network for his followers reporting it without any evidence other than haz soo many followers it has to be him
  its teh same scoring system bro every year    paint  tech  concept    the issue with the last one is that it has the same weight of any of the other 2    so you could have the most well built clean sazabi in the world but it would never win because you didnt add a thousand panel lines/greebles or had a paint scheme other than red or it wasnt part of a hyper detailed base    so your score could have been     10  10  2  total 22      meanwhile you could have an artsy looking thing have visible as fuck nubs seam lines ok paint job with some mistakes but it was an imaginative super duper thing with kibble and get this score    7  8  10    total 25    its consistent but its consistently slanted toward people who have cool ideas rather than execution
  i dont know what this image has to do with anything but that white with no shadows/border to make it pop in the top image really bothers me
  now i dont know anything about these competitions and i am just a regular joe but they have separate categories right  beyond that your pose looks like one of those standing snapfit on a persons desk pose its painted well but its just awkwardly standing there rather than drawing attention in a dynamic way
  never got this meme    who gives a shit about it having a boring pose i want to see well built/painted/detailed kits couldnt care less what pose its in
  because it helps draw attention to the eye its mostly a subconscious thing besides in dynamic pose youd be able to see more detail
  what about fss kits arent most of them locked into one pose
  if they are then thats one more thing to hate about them
  well let me say this look at the submitted image from the anon and these two images you posted theres a clear difference in how they are posed
kek
  that one on the left is an abomination
  i just dont understand what bandai is trying to do with the not gsavior its an incomplete gundam but its expansions are pbandai
  its a cropped screenshot you dunce
  its an incomplete gundam but its expansions are pbandai  bandai is just adopting the ea business model future looks bright folks
  that doesnt change what i said the white text with no border in the top part of the image where it says elitist gundam group est feb 2018 and proving the elite are not a plague on the hobby ever since making it unreadable garbage being cropped or not cropped wont change it you dumbass
  technically some of them have joints there just isnt a whole lot of actual room to move them
  speaking of fss kits wish i had the one you posted i bet painting the glyphs to look like they are glowing would be really fun
  hategroup  well youre straight wrong there kiddo  without any evidence  you mean apart from his livestreams calling out the group and poster personally or the post he deleted where he gave the name of the poster and the group name to his retarded snapfag fanbase    i know youre probably a cuck but get of the guys black dick already
  they both are temperamental trigger happy ego maniacs     the community was toxic anyways with no one qualified to teach them anything you know you can get better just by searching shit up online right perhaps even expand your search radius to military and traditional modelling techniques    that gundamnerd guy only won because the one and only judge at the convention was someone he knew he build is bad but if you dont add the concept factor you might as well go to ipms
  perhaps even expand your search radius to military and traditional modelling techniques  good advice in general i tend to search military forums all the time for advice and inspiration though be careful of some of their advice sometimes you get some really strange advice like you dont need to prime unless youre chroming or something
  priming is an important step but its important to experiment and decide for yourself i know some modelers that never prime and they produce great results there isnt a lot of surface to cover for smaller scale military vehicles so its not surprising to see that they dont prime usually a black base over the plastic is a good start for some
  they had rather large scale airplane models but yeah their models are good nonetheless
  i hate that brown for the stein
  not the anon you replied to but  kiddo  cuck  get of the guys black dick already  can you be anymore of a butthurt child     you are probably right that it was them to caused it because lets face it thats what the kids these days are like on social media
  that gundamnerd guy only won because the one and only judge at the convention was someone he knew      the only person the judge knew was the second place winner they were hanging out
  wtf you talking about there was always some post of someones build where it would be poked fun at it was fun as shit to just say what ever about the model without getting tagged by mods like in forums or reddit i posted a few snap builds i saved from here over there great times that was the point of the group to be able to say shit about a model and not be censored by special snow flakes the guy that made the post taylor or dayne or something was the most lenient admin and would allow even the modeler to be shit on and ban people who disagreed with it because their group rules allowed it it was best group and sad its gone
  try to sell badly proportion unfinished gundam  strap it to expensive shitty ugly expansion packs    wtf why do people not like it    imagine being modern sunrise/bandai i sincerely hope ibo 2/prequel or another au show is in production because theyre running out people willing to buy retools/similar kits
  ibo was nothing but retooled kits every single gundam uses the same runners and frame every single graze uses the same frame youre a moron
u wot mate
  that was a gimmick ibo kits highly vary from kit to kit other than the innerframe
  always the quality content courtesy australia zeeks had the right idea dropping colonies on you
  the narrative gundam missing armor and looking unfinished is its gimmick
figured there was enough space in the pg unicorn base to add something else besides the arduino  2x rechargable 18650 cells from an old laptop battery in parallel amazingly after 8 years still hold charge about 1600mah each to be exact  connected to a charge circuit with overcharge and short circuit protection built in which in turn is connected to a boost circuit since the 37v42v supplied by the battery needs to be a clean 5v for the arduino  using a usb breakout board to power it since i can position that wherever i like in the base  battery indicator circuit attached to the battery wiring press the button and the leds tell you the charge state based on the output voltage
    that gundamnerd guy only won because the one and only judge at the convention was someone he knew  is there any proof of this
katoki waterslide decal overload or minimal waterslide decal usage
  minimal is always best thats the general way of living life
  is there any proof of this  yeah his ass
  that soldering  what the fuck how
  just gotta make sure your soldering iron is hot enough and use flux to help solder flow
  go with what feels right i tend to stop after unit number faction insignia and maybe two warning symbols
  ok sure no problem that being said it looks like shit and its proportions are fucking bad and it comes bundled with stupid overpriced bullshit    ibo kits were unique pretty well done and cheap
love gouf  hate its long assnose/snout    how do you shorten it to be more zaku like
  you get a gouf custom
  you dont love the gouf if you dislike one of its main design points
  45 for almost 30 runners of plastic isnt overpriced
  blocks your path
  yeah no looks like  will be the only good equipment pack
anyone have this thing it looks pretty fucking rad for just being lined decald and top coated and is twice as big as bandais mg from comparison pictures it apparently came out long before bandais version too
  how does that black gloss vernier effect become achieved just gloss coat on gloss black or some other combination
  i think thats black chrome
  pretty sure those boosters come like that oob a lot of the metal details come prechromed from the videos and pictures the notice in the picture even says they did little post assembly work to achieve that look
  ah i see just the usual chrome process but using black chrome instead
  thats factory chrome plating
  nah i got that from   just wonder how to achieve similar effect found someone mentioning using black chrome and showing how it looks but not info would be neat to learn this    either way thank you
  theres probably paint for it but its also possible to achieve the same look by going through the same process as usual with chrome paint but laying down only a couple of layers of the actual chrome instead of continuing until it hits that mirror shine
  yeah i found this and really curious to try it out in few months  
  hguc revive has two head sculpts
    mr metal color has darker chrome colors like that
are these cockpit pieces really that fragile on the nu verka or does dalong have ham hands
  i dont know about nu but the strike freedom rg had my backskirt break off too and it made me extra careful since
  wow looking at that page i didnt know what they used stickers instead of color separation for that kit what the fuck
  you mean the armor thats meant as an option for those who like the rgstyle twotone look
  otakurevolution did an indepth build and review of it   looks like a lot of fitting issues compared to bandai as to be expected from a third party kit of this size   
  you mean these stickers i heard they have a matte texture and are actually decent
  id still buy it one day when i have the time to work on it for a month straight all day every day looks like a truly long term project thatd be a real centerpiece at the end of it with the time and work put in
  which one is which its hard to tell
what the fuck is that angellike els harute theyre releasing
finished painting my mg tallgeese  realized i painted it in snes colors
  nobody cares because its not final battle harute with marute option
  that sounds interesting i wanna see that
  it is not they used a different guy this year at all the usa events he did the point spread to give less weight to dioramas i spent a good 30 min talking to the man he said it was to give less weight to the types of models from last year full of greebles and shit just glued in a clusterfuck he personally weighs theme over other stuff every year it is dumb when there is only 1 us event that is judged by the real standard b/c kawaguchi
current kitbash plan  mount this oversized piece of shit on a hg gp02 do a few mods to make it look less gundam and more grunty trying to convert it from a space chunky boy into a ground type longrange fuckerupper  thats an mg in that pic for size reference by the way
i have two buster swords from the ibo option set 5 lying around so i made shoneny weapon out of those
  sharpen those things up and do a ggundam style bash
why are prices rising so steadily i remember when an hg graze was about 8 and the origin zaku was 15    even the leo is up why is this
  you idiots are buying anything at any price and when someone complains about prices you shame them into buying anyway because they dont want people to think theyre a poorfag do they    honestly its really predictable
  only the resin kits the plastic ones like the one you posted all have a plethora of joints but the engineering and nature of the designs makes them immobile
  side effect of bandai moving into a pbandai only release model
  chinese aesthetic values are so ugly  all the mechanicore kits look like a clusterfuck of edges and random fins and rubbish stuck all over the place for no reason  reminds me of michael bays transformers
  ibo prices was special
mg dynames is up for preorder niggers
how do you guys propose altering a leg connection from a peg to a ball to use different legs i want to have minimal chopping but a straight cement fixture seems way too fragile for something thats going tk be torqued all the time
  chinese aesthetic values are so ugly  its a japanese indy company you retard
  i think the ball polycaps are slightly larger than the usual bandai socket so you could try shaving one down to fit  otherwise you could try kotobukiyas msg balljoints  there are a few different kinds with varying sizes
  mechanicore is chingchong chinamen
  pretty sure that the designers for the original mold arent chinese the thing is just produced in china a lot of the original preproduction and promo photos for those kits hover around japanese malaysian and flip sites / groups
  ah sorry let me clarify the legs are a female ball and the waist connection is a male peg ive inserted square pcs into the female ball space but theres zero horizontal movement
  you leave the original peg to keep it structurally sound then add a ball on top of it theres aftermarket joint sets out there that are just the ball with a hole drilled into it so you just pop it on top and youre done
  oh boss i havnt seen those can i get a push in the right direction for them
  you can cut off the pegs drill in then insert and glue in the ball joints i posted
this is what i ended up doing for my tallgeese the inner frame/boosters are all gunmetal     should i use black/grey/white waterslides or should i also include purple it looks like a snes
where can i catch up on gunpla releases wanna check if anything interesting is coming out next year
  which mg is that 30
  origin or oyw
  oyw origin looks nothing like it
so my mom told me to get some gunpla for my dad for christmas aside from getting him a puzzle i suggest i get him a gunpla for him to build when hes in toronto but i dont specifically know what gunpla to get him maybe a psycho zaku
  hes your dad i assume youd know his tastes best a hg is usually a good entry point
  thought so too was considering an mg jegan for him but i think that would be a little much
  the head is way too proportional to the body to be the pinheaded origin version
  why dont you get him something he actually likes instead if its his first gunpla i guess you cant go wrong with the hg revive rx78
  can we get more context on why your mother suggested getting him a gunpla
  well ever since last christmas the most common thing i got him were puzzles the minor issue is since theres relatives that come over and they have little kids the chances that pieces may become lost are a little well more likely    so my mom suggested to me that i get him something constructive for him to build that isnt a puzzle i figured a model kit would be just fine namely a military plane since hes rcaf but my mom said no as itll require him getting materials he may or may not need thus the mention of gunpla for their snapfit construction    i tried to pine in a master grade but that was almost immediately shot down and the plan is to get him two hgs the suggestions i sortof have open to me is a leo revive classic gundam and a few others    well i am getting a buddy of mine an ageii magnum and a copy of new gundam breaker so there might be something
  new gundam breaker  you dun goufed
my very first gunpla    i tried to do everything meticulously i ignored some of the stickers because im planning on getting paint
  i cant even tell if this is bait or not
  why would it be bait
what does /gpg/ do when they cant think of a color scheme for their model
     the models come in precolored plastic
  i look through my paints and see what i still have a fuckton of at the very least itll stand out on my shelf
  first look at gundamkitscollection for any featured builds  failing that look at other suits i like as a reference to colors
    i am just drawing a blank between going full on faithful dark gray and red going for a flashy look police or going for a military look was thinking about different blue shades for a sky color scheme
  speaking of which got a picture of your shelf
its officially december for the us east coast which means its almost the end of the year time to start making your compilations     what did you build this year anons
  another year where ive done fucking nothing  kill me
  think about how various colors would look on it think about what colored paints ive been meaning to try and it they would work on it stress over how to do the color layout look up pictures of other peoples painted builds take a picture of it after priming and reassembling then print out black and white pictures of it to color in with colored pencils to test out ideas cry for a bit and pull some more hair out scream into my japanese shouting urn to rid my body of anger demons buy 5 different shades and mixes of what is essentially the same color wonder if the sleepless nights and newly regular ear bleeding is from worry about what color to paint a plastic toy all day try to find a comfort food i saw in my dreams but am not sure actually exists catch myself trying to identify the specific colors of cars around me in traffic and then finally get fed up and just grab a color and start painting while praying it comes out okay it usually does
anyone here have many votoms kits i recently decided to get some of the bandai 1/20th votoms kits but cant decide which of the many scopedogs is the best one to buy ive ordered the fatty ground type brutishdog and the pbandai turbosack  round mover / solid shooter sets from mandarake now i need a scopedog or 2 which one comes with the most extras dalong doesnt have info on the pbandai scopedogs theres at least 5
unlimited supply at gundam base
  i am so tired of unicorns do people really want to buy a unicorn gundam every time a new version of one comes out
  weird im having the same issue with my mg jegan right now im trying to think of what i dont already have a lot of so blue and white are out looking at other suits can help tho
tfw you finally take the slidepill  snappies dont know what theyre missing    bandai are also turbokikes for not making waterslides the default on anything rg and above shit really is easier than stickers
  yes as bandai keeps making more because people keep buying
  what happened to your panel lines on the gray pieces did you use markers
in the end the whole fuck up with the clear red turned out a bit better than i feared still lessons learned
  looks nice what kit is that
  usually i paint my kits innthe original colors and add some slight color/tone variation i just really like the original color scheme of most suits i buy otherwise i generally think of a theme and start looking for inspiration on google like with the graze ein im working on right now
  graze ein
  ill admit that color scheme is not for me i wouldnt use purple waterslides because i think they would be too much
  if you place a tramp tattoo on it youll make it look like a mquve custom
tempted to buy a moon gundam are there any cons to the kit
  beyond minimal painting not really its a good looking suit oob not a fan of overlined designs bandai been experimenting with but alot of people like it so i expect it to continue on
  yeah i used markers    is there a better way to line without going full paintfag
  id say the tamiya or mr color pre thinned panel line accent colors as long as you dont throw the entire bottle on your kit it shouldnt be doing damage to the plastic itself a bottle will last you a life time
  thanks its the hg graze ein thing is as big as a small mg
  this    however if you really dont trust yourself with enamel like he said then just go with mr weathering color its lighter fluid based mixed with oil so its a bit safer but still dont slather it on lighter fluid is still considered dangerous for plastic but it usually evaporates before it becomes a problem in smaller doses
  locked into one good pose
  started this hobby around october and so far im loving it i still have guard frame waiting to be build and i need to start learning to paint simple shit using sticker is a pain in the ass
  my fucking pg came with stickers its actually insane
  oh yeah good call its quite satisfying to look back on what youve made even if not everything turned out quite how youd hoped i really should get a better light setup though shame my room is so tiny your pictures look real good
  subtle  well done
  ver ka and pbandai mgs come with water slides  pgs come with stickers
  i cant make out any nub marks so kudos my advice is taking pictures in natural light as in outside your panel lines are pretty thick its a good idea to wipe you kit down to remove excess lining they will be thinner and more subtle and it will look better
  would nub marks matter so long as theyre sanded flat if hes planning to paint over
is this good fighting pose or legs are off    overall build strike seems hard to pose with all that parts with vastly different loose and popping out
  with that sort of stance lower the left arm with the fingertips pointed more upward and raise the right arm with the fist pointed in the same direction as the eyes are facing
    no idea im not expert in martial arts
  just look up kenshiro ffs
  do the pose yourself if its supposed to be readying a build knuckle tilt the wrist joint on the open hand upward so that the open palms facing towards the target lift the punching arm shoulder upward as far as itll go rotate the bicep swivel inward towards the body and turn the fist so that the palm is rotated 45 degrees between facing downward and facing towards the body as if you were about to throw a haymaker
  you dont really have to be just consider where the limbs are whats exposed etc usually you dont extend your lead leg like that because it opens it to getting your knee broken or dislocated so whenever theres a stance like in tai chi or something where you do that you generally see it paired with a lowered and extended lead arm to protect that leg    look at examples from real life to see what other sorts of positions get used
  youre probably right so i should just stick to white/black/grey ones no red
    i dont know what build knuckle is sorry but thanks for the tip        well i would rather stand like this but again i always avoided fighting dad wanted me to beat everyone up mom wanted to never engage in fight and talk out everything
i went ahead and ordered the amazonbasics lightbooth i hope you lads didnt steer me wrong    
  what should i wipe it down with the excess lining doesnt seem to want to come off
i hope we get a rg phenex i dont think hg will do it justice
  i dont know what build knuckle is sorry  buying lead protagonist kits without watching the source material theyre from
  they will 110 milk everything unicorn and totally not unicorn 2 narrative related
  nvm i just noticed the retarded tails i dont want a rg phenex unless that shit is optional  wtf bandai stop fucking with shit that was fine
  only nt phenex has those
okay and how about this pose or any backwards sword will look stupid
    thats how i do all the time i buy kits that looks cool i tried watching ibo but disliked protagonists and supporting antagonists so i had to drop it
  well you could do the infamous thats why im taking you down scene from gsd where the freedom has both swords held backward 
  there is nothing wrong with this but people are going to shit on you on /m/ you should have at least spent 5 seconds to google build knuckle though
  try thunderbolt  granted there arent a whole lot of thunderbolt specific kits and the really nice ones might be out of your price range but the anime is pretty satisfying from visual and auditory perspective and the narrative takes a backseat to the action its also relatively early in uc canon if it even really fits in so it can sorta be watched whenever without having to watch other gundam series to understand it
  i dont know what build knuckle is sorry but thanks for the tip    you should go watch build fighters even if you dont catch all of the references i still think its a solid piece of fun
  even if you dont catch all of the references  half of the appeal of build fighters is going hah i get that like an overgrown child
    which episode is that just entering that to youtube gives me nothing
  assuming they do make it why dont you just dont build the tails
  would have to see how the kit assembles ideally they include a small piece to simply cover the tail connector and build the traditional rg phenex but theres always the real possibility itll be an ugly connector that will have to be covered with a scratchbuild  which yes is not too hard to do but then you have to match the paint scheme which is a real nightmare to do on a plated glossy rg kit
  willing to scratch build pieces   but not paint    
jesus christ
  have you ever actually tried to match paint its one thing to repaint an entire kit its another thing to try to match a very specific glossy gold finish on a kit  lmao just repaint the entire rg kit that will cost a significant amount of money because of the fancy undergated plating  no thanks might as well just buy a mg at that point
  you can paint an entire rg for 510 dollars you cheap jew
  one of the big selling points of a rg is that you dont have to paint it because you are paying a premium for a proper paint job unlike a hg kit if you plan on repainting it why not just buy a mg it just escapes me why you would spend all that money on a rg and then strip it and paint it in some other color scheme when most rgs rg sinanju comes to mind look excellent out of the box
  even the paper in the background looks half assed
  go with mr weathering color i switched from tamiya panel line accent and it works a lot better for me more variety of colors too if you decide to experiment
  going to paint my pg exia soon  see this    im afraid
but what is next rg
  next big rg  nu or narrative    if they reveal a small rg next  some zaku/unicorn variant
  likely wing zero proto or unicorn/phenex variant  want nu or gelgoog
  are these the kinda elitists that are legitimately good or are they the kinda people who think theyre at the top when they arent
    scratchbuild piece  paint it gray  call it a battle damage retrofit    bam
any ideas what to look for to find polycap adapters for example to convert a peg to a ball  english is not my main language and im having alot of trouble finding anything for sale
  literally ctrlf this thread
  sorry meant im having trouble finding anyone selling them adapters and think im searching wrong
  kotobukiya msg has balljoints and i reckon you could probably take one drill out the ball to the size you need and then fit and glue it to the end of the peg
  since a unicorn is coming out this month theres a couple of options   likely astray blue frame exia dark matter infinite justice zaku variant providence gundam  rg nu will probably be the big rg release next year like the sazabi was this year
    barbados
  friendly link
  it reminds me of kuugas titan form i really like the purple trim replacing the yellow
banana returns
  i hope bandai gives us a kit of bananas silver buillet variant
  this set has ones with holes in them but theyre sold out on this website      these are balls with sticks attached that you could cut off and drill to fit  
go get them boy
mg kampfer leg is loose  hopefully its because i didnt forced the screw too much in when i was building and it got loose a bit  what should i do im thinking about opening it    to fix it but the plastic looks like its going to break  any tips
  it shouldnt matter as long as theyre sanded flat if using sandpaper going over the nub in grit increments  up to 1200 or so will make the area nice and smooth if youre just doing touch ups and color applications with paint instead of stickers a top coat will go a long way in completely removing nub marks
  what did you use to line it with you could use a hobby knife to scrape off excess dipping a q tip in isopropyl alcohol will do the trick if you used a sharpie or paint of some kind
  what did you use to panel line it you can use the tip of a hobby knife to scrape off excess dabbing a qtip with isopropyl alcohol could also work
am i the only one who isnt fond of candy coat
gundam zerachiel has a tank mode  sold
  this is cool and all but its literally just waverider mode on the ground
  im going to buy this and paint it like the harute and nobody can stop me
  i hope tankfag feels shitty for how shitty his tank is now in comparison
  like  said its just the harutes jet mode with the wings flipped 180 degrees and the front piece placed farther back at first glance i thought the treads on top were missile pods     still getting it because harutes my favorite gundam
  doesnt make my point any less valid
i have reduced my backlog to 2 kits  which one should i do next  hg sazabi  hg 00 7 swords
  sazabi 7 swords is a fine kit that youll enjoy no matter when you build it
  hg sazabi is kinda shit so get that out of the way
   00 7 swords  is a great kit id build the sazabi and then the 00 to wash away the bad taste
  looks straight out of starfox
  laaaaaaaaaaandmastuh
having some trouble fitting the mesh pipes on mk2 is there any trick to it they keep coming out and i cant even close the part on the leg
  on the mg 20 or the rg  ive only built the mg hazel which use the 20 frame and ive had no problems with the mesh  if they keep coming out you probably cut it too short
  rg forgot to mention i actually tried going aroud 11mm when it said to do 10mm but theyre too loose anyway
have tons of spare pieces i will probably never use  cant bring myself to toss them because i might want them someday
  have any seraphim arms
  tfw inner autist only allows me to buy kits from shows ive seen
    
  tfw inner autist only allows me to give different colour schemes to kits ive modded in some way
  my autism compels me to paint kits like other kits
  not watching try  bad  i couldnt even finish that shit didnt stop me from buying a few kits
  are you actually retarded what is your stance on tanks in races
what else can you do as a straightfag other than panel lining to make your gunpla look cooler
  buy decal sheets and top coat it
    yes panel lining decal and matte top coat and it already looks as pro as it gets
  you can try scribing and plaplating
  what else can you do as a straightfag other than panel lining to make your gunpla look cooler    go learn from all bunker plas tutorials on youtube there are a lot of things you can do without paint definitely watch his pastel shading  part tuning tutorials to start with    his hinu gundam bust build video is a good example of a lot of techniques you can do without paint in one video    
  this guys results with seam welding and shading techniques in his other videos are really damn good without airbrushing i dont know how he can hand paint big surfaces either and make it look completely smooth and thin with mr color like he did for his gourai build
tfw youre apprehensive about buying anything new like the mg dynames because not sure when are they releasing the rg version  why is rg so good but so far in between bros
  hell happen here his clear blue coat fucked up
  the manga is great for thunderbolt too thats how i got initially hooked in it when watching all the post and pregundam army grunts hanging out and doing their little things really like it when stories focus on the soldiers doing soldier things
  this reminds me of how when sometimes you get pen ink on your hand and try to rub it off
      translation no more cluster fuck builds go b e y o n d    make an inspirational work of art
  because the western gunpla community is shit at actual modeling so they needed to change the criteria to focus on the points theyre actually capable in
  theres just less entries asian communities are flooded with more shit builds than the west but thats due to having larger community its like asians are magically better at modeling just because they are born asian and their father gives them a scapel
finally cleaned up my spare closet and found this old boi that i built 8 years ago what do you guys think i should do with it    if there are no good suggestions im gonna deep fry this boy and display him in my kitchen
  ive built the bandai berkoff squad rsc and brutish dog the rsc has the most extras between the two i own
do you think theyll ever reprint the builders parts system weapons or am i just hoping for the impossible
  do you have a gun and if so what caliber
  gonna request some realistic battle damage
  specifically the warshipcannon idea i posted a few threads back
    my gramps has an old smith  wesson revolver i think its the model 10 or 13    i dont think i can really repair the poor thing once its shot tho
  how about you seam weld it and fix it to show how far youve come instead of destroying it for shitty memes
  i could but i want memes
  well you missed the meme build a while ago with the fat fucking purple thing so too late for that
  anon destroying his granpapas ol gun to shoot up an old toy for an autistic basket weaving community  god bless the old mans soul
    for an old kit that actually has good proportions ideally you should paint it    but this is /m/ where faggots like  would rather shoot it than make it look good
  nigga i made a joke because people actually do shoot it for realistic battle damage the fuck do you think  means
  thats a marbling effect i think it just looks like shit with the color scheme he picked
  oh is that what the creator claimed or what you think happen because his sword makes me x doubt that then again with how fucked it is i dont know
  i guess youre right but im not gonna wait for another rerun of the meme build      destroying  hold up my gramps takes good care of his guns and id doubt his revolver would just implode on itself if it just fired once      i would paint it and make it pretty and all but im really tired of doing that i kinda wanna do some destruction or memes
    whats the point of this site at first everyone seemed happy about the news of a pbandai for north america but then it finally comes out and they are only selling tshirts not gunpla is this just another subtle fuck you gaijin to make us go through hell just for online exclusive model kits
  to make us go through hell    there is nothing difficult about obtaining pbandai kits online you dont even need to deal with middlemen if you go through sites like mandarake hell the cost of the kit is less than a normal retail release in a great deal of countries outside asia  the us
  north america    you have the lowest prices outside of japan and insanely cheap or even free shipping through amazon yet are always the first to whine like spoiled entitled babbies i hope your orange overlord gets you banned from trading with japan next after hes finished with china
just need to do the weapons
  this makes me want to get the clear version of the mg 00 raiser and get the green led base
im thinking of what kit should i get for myself this christmas and im debating whether id get a zz ver ka or an rg seven swords inspection kit which one would you choose bros
  zz  i already have a rg 00 tho
  personally i love bulky suits and this big heroic super robotlike suits so i would get zz what are you planning to do with the kits snapfit paint kitbash etc
  you have the lowest prices outside of japan  source
  ill just snapfit and panel line it then buy waterslides at a later date and then apply them      hows the rg 00 though my friends say the zz doesnt even feel like a transforming suit with how solid it is
  wouldnt china/korea/sea have the cheapest prices since gunpla has historically sold incredibly fucking well in the asian market granted na still probably has cheaper prices than europe thanks to no customs or vat
  im not seeing the problem
  matte is a meme it looks bland and chalky satin or semi is best finish
  you retard the guy said hes a snapfag he isnt going to have an airbrush gloss and semigloss looks like trash from a rattlecan
  hows the rg 00 though  loose like every rg mine can barely hold up its gn sword iii anymore the zz is a solid 10/10 kit and my recommendation
tfw ill never be able to afford the pbandai hyaku shiki kai   200 bux for a toy is expensive
snapped up this chunky boi gonna give him the mak treatment
  loose like every other rg  i have 6 rgs at the moment and aside from the exia none of them have gotten loose yet maybe its because of all the weight it has to support perhaps     i may consider getting the zz but i might get both depending on how much ill be getting during the holidays
  you still cant convince the /gpg/ anon
  makes me wonder  do you really need to panel line if you are planning to paint it
hires astray looks fucking godly oob dat articulation too    
leaked upcoming weathering starter pack from mr hobby
  its a big sword and the choulder cup they use on every one is really prone to loosening up as for the rest of the rgs they have a really bad habit of loosening up over time
where are my reprints bandai
  pic says tamiya  post says mr hobby  
these chinks really refined this thing from the prototype picture someone posted a while back kind of want to pick up one since bandai will probably never release anything new kshatriya related and their metal line is shit anyways elyn kshatriya pretty much doesnt exist anymore either and the things 1k when it does show up on auctions  
  nub ridden hellscape  seams because pieces arent properply pressed together  extremely shitty photo  geez i wonder why
  pretty sure its facetiously remarking that tamiya is overrated because the image poster is pretending to shill for mr hobby which again makes no sense anyway because hes clearly trying to make fun of people who overweather and the addition of doublenamedropping just convolutes thingsthe only question is why why is he making such a confusing mess out of such a simple joke i just dont get it
  probably mentally ill
  its not that hard anon just look into some stock images or character poses
  the guy obviously isnt painting the entire thing just where he left off the stickers its got to be a satire shitpost fishing for replies though because he said he tried to do everything carefully yet the panel lining makes it look like he has parkinsons disease
  just a filename  cant think of a better meme
got my hands on the narrative a packs tell me the truth lads what am i in for gotta admit i didnt really think this through
anyone have the re/100 gerbera thinking about getting it 10/10 suit
  did anyone really ask for this not being rude just curious
  its an easy kit for bandai to make since 90 of it is from the mg age ii double bullet saying that though the series sold terribly and most people dislike divers i dont get why bandai would make more expensive build divers merchandise like mgs if the series isnt well liked and didnt sell well
  ive always hated how limited edition this hobby feels but then again the japanese love limited edition shit so it makes sense its just frustrating that if you dont buy a kit during the month or two its in production run it might be months or even years before you get another chance imagine getting into the hobby right now and having to look at the hundreds of cool kits you literally cant buy until bandai reprints them or they pop up on mandarake for a day or two
  im still trying to find a hg clanche custom
    this is 5940 yen btw
  the salting can still be tasted
  and it tastes like mcdonalds french fries
okay im having a hell of a time coming up with a color scheme for the jegan i dont like its bland mintiness and im trying to avoid blue because i have lots of blue kits as is honestly im not sure i even like any of these
  i vote for guncannon
  general revil colors exist
  age kits dont get restocked often presumably because the show flopped hard the last time the clanche custom got reprinted was november 2017 along with a bunch of other age kits so its probably due for another run in the next six months or so
  age is my favorite series  tfw
  panel line monster no inner framewaist may get very loose and ruin your poseslegs are nice but everytime you pose the kit they tend to come off same for the arms  aestethics are 10/10 though
no gunpla backlog  decide to build a cheap ft17 model i bought on a whim  have to glue 172 handles on the doors  poland was a mistake big fingers too  i dont even know what year it was printed in but as a zoomer and given the state of the paper the plastic might be older than me
  in the last three years there were only eight months where age hgs got reprints out of those eight reprints the clanche custom got another run three times in november 2017 february 2017 and august 2016 hopefully can fit it into their schedule and you can get your own in 2019    one day im going to organize these nouhin pdfs into some google spreadsheet fuckery that keeps track of how often kits get restocked when a kit was last restockedand how this shit ties into whatever gundam show was airing during that time
  dom has a nice ace color scheme but guncannons pretty nice
what do you /m/en think
  i want a zeydra and id even go for a pbandai genoace ii ocustom id buy two
  thats the mg rouge right
  yes mg rouge and mg aile strike
  ah ok i was going to buy that rouge but opted for the astray frame d instead
  i see you have excellent taste in ninja robots
  you are like babby
  who the fuck is babby
  dude are you me fuck paying 30 for an hg its a shame because i really like the design and its the perfect base for a project i have in mind
so what do you all look for in a display base  i am thinking of making one out of glass
  detolf from ikea
  perspective makes the big gun look like its resting on the bottle in the back
serious question about display bases and photos    i had conversation with somebody good at making photos but not doing models and after showing off few of mine i got told that display base proudly pointing from models ass ruins everything making photo shit no matter what    so whats your opinion i know that i cant hide display base sometimes and cant make airborne poses without it
    check the bottom of this site theres some really good stuff there about model photography that can help
  im not getting at you but most f those color schemes are far too garish for a grunt suit a gm should ways be with his friends alternatively go for grey and navy over white and red for an efsf feel
  that smaller mobile suit thing that comes with the hg gm sniper ii can be painted to look like one of her dolls
  no i get what youre saying i mostly just took existing ms color schemes and translated them over the jegan is one of those suits that can be colored almost any way but im having trouble finding a scheme that i like that will stand out from my collection
  grunt suits dont tend to suit the same color schemes that aces do just look at the likes of the cima gelgoog and the strike dagger grunts really need to have more subtle color scheme opting for 1 or 2 colors with grey details instead of the 3 or 4 color schemes that aces tend to have honeslty dont try to think too extravagant stick to 2 colors which contrast each other white and olive turquoise and black beige and navy are subtle gruntish suit colors that wont make a gunpla look like some oc ace unit wannabee
does anybody know if theres a list or something of all of bclubs 1/220 garage kits i ended up getting their sazabi kit at least i think they sculpted it and its pretty nice the site i bought it from seems to have a few others but im not sure how many they made in that weird scale
  i think were thinking in two different ways youre going for an inuniverse look where i just want something that looks neat purely designwise the jegan has a really well rounded design that lends itself to a lot of customization like the zaku im not really thinking how it would fit as a grunt just as does this color scheme look good and to i like it
  you should paint it up like alphonse here and make it a civilian police mobilesuit
new thread when
  where you guys getting the chinese bootlegs from anyway i want to huff and sneeze to death with the bulky boi too
new thread        
favorite transformer
  none transformers is shit
  predaking
  autobot wheeljack  decepticon bludgeon  idw cyclonus
optimus prime
  prime  g1 soundwave  prime shockwave
scorponok
maximus
buffimus prime
omega supreme
this guy needs to be integrated into future media rather than be a oneshot for bayformers
best boy
soundwave wfc has my favorite design
dinobot
  its one of the coolest designs ive seen for shockwave other than the prime series yeah sucks they buit him and his worm only for him to be beaten too easily and the worm not doing much but two fight scenes
jetfire
  i really hope he goes the way of lugnut bulkhead and lockdown  hell barricade has made it out of bayformers too and nitro zeus has way more personality than him
  cosmos is best boy    he saves the autobots from falling into the sun hes one of the only autobots capable of spaceflight hes dumpy and turns into an adamski type flying saucer hes called adams in japan for this reason    i have a thing for flying saucers though so im probably the only one who likes him so much
  hes also the patron transformer of neets everywhere    from his original transformers card    lonely in outer space relieves boredom by scaring humans by hovering over their backyards at night or zigzagging through meteor showers can achieve earth orbit even go to moon and back with enough fuel acts as communications satellite optical sensors can see bicycle at 600 miles has pinpoint accuracy highpowered particle beam not well suited to function on ground as robot    lonely  fat  ugly  not suited to function on ground like the rest of the autobots  prime parks him in orbit to act as a stationary comm satellite and forgets about him  crashes in all but one episode hes ever been in    poor bastard    we like to think if i was a transformer id be optimus prime or id be ironhide    but really wed all be cosmos
probably a tossup between star saber and g1 starscream     i asked my kindasorta girlfriend for mp star saber for christmas    its a shame about how he was portrayed in the idw comics especially since his design was actually really neat that time around oh well
  chugway
  yeah but that fucking girlfriend of his
  you the lineart guy
  nova prime
hes still got the touch
  unworthy    smokescreen is hot rod done right
  hes also the patron transformer of neets everywhere  objection
  im a big fan of the seekers starscream is my favorite
blaster best
  wow thats incredible    i can smell the chicken tendies and crusty fap socks from here
  nova prime is the kira yamato of transformers
also sky lynx     neither have acceptable toys
bludgeon
what happened to dinobot didnt he die
  yes
civictron
  whats wrong with the first one
  he realized he was saved by a guy who doesnt know how to save pictures from pixiv
wheeljack is best
  mobile suit gundam is my favorite transformer
jetfire    baybee
  no thats just you being an asshole    i wanna know whats wrong with the first sky lynx toy
  favorite transformer  usually just whichever toy i last played with  so right now its rippersnapper
  this isnt a macross thread
  its fine jetfire is not a macross
for the longest time soundwave but he shares a spot with star saber and naviko
  wing and zero are literally jet fighters  deathscythe is a ground vehicle hell and custom becomes a kilrathi srakha stealth fighter and later a chaos hellblade fighter  heavy arms has a tank mode custom becomes a vertibird
      thats skyfire though
  nah das wing zero
    gestalts had all sorts of physical and technical problems once they combined but menasor had none    his only limitation was that the other 4 hated motormaster so badly that they refused to work together cohesively    its intredasting
    flying combiner whose leader is scared of heights    0/10
  looks rad as hell though
    gotta admit its a great name too
  lordy
this jew or his boss    although im bad at picking favorites i love them all in their own way
  baby dan dan
  shit this is probably my answer all time fictional villain
    actually who am i kidding    make way for best decepticon if megatron had a lieutenant of this calibre it would have been all over
  kindasorta girlfriend  so basically youre exclusive to her while she goes around fucking whoever she wants
    nah not really shes my sugar mommy
best design is idw
  mein nigger
  love astrotrain
starscream    duh
  i like mp star saber despite his size he has good articulation but hes notable for having loose elbow joints youll have to manually tighten it or buy upgrade kits if you go for the latter make sure you use a jos screwdriver or else the screws will get damaged
big convoy seems pretty cool hope neo gets subbed sometime

  but its in my top 3 srw games      ux is a spinoff
  srw v announced to have hit over 500000 in sales winning the ps award gold prize and rivalling z1 510000 being higher than everything since thenthis includes overseas and digital with japan physical only being 200000      for reference  z21 455000  z22 344000  z31 381000  z32 295000  ux 177000  bx 122000  og 2 293000  md 131000    still far from alpha series sales though  alpha 750000  alpha gaiden 580000  alpha 2 530000  alpha 3 644000
  its still a bad game along with x
  at least v and x are better than z3 and oe
  stop lying you fucking faggot    it is japan only the image in the op even only states the japanese name of srw v
    red dead redemption 2 which would easily sell millions of copies is not on this list    game from october 2018 is not on list that only games from oct 2017sep 2018 are eligible for    brainlet no can understands months
  they literally said in the t stream that v and x each sold about 200k in japan dude
    v sold 500k in japan despite sales looking like  for the past decade    literal retard
    店頭消化率は75前後と高水準で推移したが2017年に発売されたスーパーロボット大戦vps4ps vita/発売週180万本/累計253万本    dumbfuck
  japan sales    v 253000  x 137000
      kill yourself faggot
  at least v and x are better than the absolute bottom of the barrel  ok
holy fuckin dimes
  just saying since oe the games have been getting better yes they still suck but at least they are better
  main srw peaked at z1  og peaked at 2nd  outsourced gbads3ds peaked at ux    its all been downhill since then
  i came here to laugh at you
can i win an award for the 400 or so downloads that this got
say hello to your new og inclusions
  well youre fangame is doing better than mine    i having trouble getting stage 1 to a playable state
  that x sales didnt look too good i guess even nips hate it
are you a gundam weeaboo /m/
  why did x do so bad
  wow it only took 3 years
  fags used to be a gay slur but nowadays its synonymous with fans
  its a very rushed game
who is the biggest draw in v anyway 
    was shitposting all the time makes you become a dumb retard
nine shouldve fucked chitose
  yamato obviously zero is close but its mostly thanks to people already being srw fans
  yamato zero tetsuya
  first sea release
  that would be md
  yeah but nobody cares about md so whatever
  lying on the internet
  i would say og peaked with og 2/ogs gaiden was lackluster and 2nd was pretty boring at times and pretty much only had alpha2/3 fan hype carrying it
  but og2 was fucking awful do you remember the school plot and the einst on top of that
  it had a lot of hype going on all the time you were getting new units or new upgrades    i never expected good plots from og because it is even more awful somehow than mainline srw games so the least i expect is a constant flow of new shit to play with and in those aspects every game after it sucked big time
  ogs maybe but og2 gba was hated at the time for what it did with axel
  considering how most fanbases act its still accurate to its old meaning
  the school plot was the only part i thought was really bad
  as someone who never played other games with axel aside of og2  what did it do to him
  i would say that dullsukes heavy importance in the plot was just as awful if not more he was ing before ing become a thing as far as being a black hole that steals the spotlight goes
  lots of things after alfimi and him save each other they essentially decide to live and fight for this earth because what else do they have to do    axel now isnt a complete raging asshole and is willing to work with the steel dragons even mentoring one of the younger guys
  they turned a goofy cool protagonist guy basically haken or a male xiaomu/excellen into an edgelord villain who dies like a bitch as a midboss
  og2 on gba depicted axel as an outright villain it was later retconned in the og compilation though
  are you retarded
  and that was so fucking stupid there were better ways to spare axel than to make him fuse with the newtype ghost of alfimi that and the very fact that alfimi just plain shouldnt have survived it or at least do it by being reborn through sexcellen
  no yamato to push sales
  thats the retconned ps2 game anon
  oh i can sum up the original thusly hes a crazy raging asshole who hates androids and dies like a bitch hes extremely obsessed with kyouske and while this is true for the generations version they actually toned it down since axel would be reminded that he had more important things to do
  school plot  bad  sanger vs wodan  rai and ratsel wiping archibalds smug fucking grin off the face of the earth    the earth cradle plot is 10 000/10 the actual school characters arent actually that terrible either
  lmao
      i see id play a portable later on but ill be using lamia cause after og2 she is my favorite new og2 character
  id play a portable later on but ill be using lamia    oh you poor soul
  warning everyone in ap has 30 less accuracy than normal for some reason and lamia doesnt get strike and the game just barely predates upgradeable accuracy on mechs
  in before don zaucer memes
i just realized that since excellens va is dead the chances of getting another ogs anime is probably zero      my first and only playthrough of ap was lamia with the angelg and i took the nadesico route it was suffering
  dont forget you cannot hit lemon
  with best new og2 mech to boot    yeah i heard the rumors but thanks for heads up
  they have less accuracy because iirc a was from the era where mobility  accuracy    also on that note fun fact ap only changed a few spirit locations usually this was sensible stuff  obviously miracle is gone and needed replaced giving love to someone at level 1 would be fundamentally stupid in ap but its otherwise arguably too minimalistic  but one of the more random changes they made was that in a lamia had strike and both she and axel had a version of newtype
  school plot  bad  while i dont viscerally hate it or anything lets be honest most of it is just    youre brainwashed  nuh uh youre brainwashed  nuh uh youre brainwashed    and    i didnt kidnap latooni  yes you did  no i didnt
sturumu  unt  dorankuuuuuuu
  sanger vs wodan  rai and ratsel wiping archibalds smug fucking grin off the face of the earth  thats not the school plot those are just cool things that were happening at the same time the school plot is the arado/seolla/ouka endless brainwashing loop
  compensate with abusing attune on keiko if you want to have a remotely enjoyable time
  angelg  i really kind of hate the guide for underselling the angelg its a good choice if youre already set on playing lamia basically just the vysaga which trades its shield and a bit of power for a beam coat and much more range range being particularly important in a game where support attacks are essential raz angriff also has a lot of range but unlike angelg its only post movement option is its weakest move and it has less flexibility with its support since it cant fly ashsaber is competitive especially because of its sustainability but lacks angelgs power and double image
  i still think w was the handhelds peak  and ogs was definitely better than 2nd
  angelg isnt half bad statistically and gunfight parts are significantly less competitive than infight parts especially if you arent going to the spconsumption down parts lamia not having strike sucks but it isnt as big of a deal breaker as people will tell you it is for most of the game    i feel like people just undersell it because of the whole dualstat issue it has
  ogs1 was great but ogs2s pacing meandered a bit in the middle 2nd does have 17 stages of ex but once you get out of that part its pretty good from then on
og1 can never be great because fucking ryusei water stages and all your gespents dont have tesla drives for flying
  maybe i felt it less because i didnt put any stat parts on my og anyway no point in doing so if you want to switch protagonists between playthroughs
    all the mp gespenst mk ii m kai/custom used by steel dragons developed under halloween plan has builtin tesla drive though no longer will you be terrorized by shitty water stages
  water stages mostly stop after bian and cybuster/grungust/schutzwald and the haganes 18p torpedoes can carry you easily
  i didnt mind the pacing
  i didnt have much trouble with the water stages
really the thing that was the worst about ap is that there was only one music track for every scene that didnt take place on a map the fuck was up with that
  thanks
everyone and their mom is playing a portable so i decided to fire up vanilla a  now what does 限界 do again
  if i remember well those below hp and en are mobility armor and the shitty limit stat
  having axel and fiona as my favorites of their respective games made me hate og2 and its remake a little
  but they made axel op as fuck in og2nd and md with attacker and soulgain is one of the best units in those games    while fiona gets shafted in og2nd being a subpilot  sp pool and just barely gets back in action with gunstriker in md
  so what does limit do
  fiona was great in ogg too bad we never got her eternal back
  now what does 限界 do again  final stats for robot are pilot  robot stats but the robot has a cap on how high the combined stats can go which you raise by upgrading that if you dont upgrade it the pilots stats have no effect    basically the idea that even if you put a fantastic pilot in a shitty unit youll end up with a shitty unit because the robot cant keep up and upgrading it is like the rx78 getting its magnetic coating
  ironically enough far less so than it used to which is the exact opposite of what the groups supposedly advocating for acceptance and normalization should be pushing for
  i see thanks
  luckily its generally cheap to upgrade you do want to keep on top of it though since it effects accuracy for everyone as well
  the gunstriker is alright to use
  a relic of primitive srw it limited your accuracy and evasion as the sum of your pilot relevant stats accuracy or evasion  mobility couldnt be above the limit     usually doesnt even need to be touched by tanky but slow unit but speedy units with equally evasive and accurate pilots should upgrade it each time they hit the current cap
  fiona says shes out shopping  but shes under me and im not stopping
  its not the same as the elegance and grace of the eternal
    soon in hd or we riot
  wtf /m/ you told me the franchise was on gacha life support
  turns out basing how well a game sold off of only japanese physical copy sales was a stupid fucking idea who knew
still sales are below older games and while a niche genre srw games should at least sell 1m copies with the large player base around the world but it does not
  japan physical sales for v were still only 253000 while x was barely above half of that at 137000
  ok but like wouldnt digital copies turn more profit than physical copies
  yeah but barely anyone buys digital in japan because theyre fucking retarded and charge full retail for all downloads even though retail stores dont charge full retail
    buying digital ever    top kek
  digital sales are retarded
    for reference new games at retail stores in japan are almost always at around 20 off 20 off price or 20 back in points or 10 off and 10 points additionally preordering or purchasing early gets bonus stuff like exclusive dlc soundtracks books etc if you recall seeing concept art of stuff from ogmd that was from the preorder book that came with x or v    meanwhile digital copies are 100 of retail with no points and usually no bonuses at all a few games have added bonuses to digital preorders lately but theyre mostly garbage like wallpapers made out of existing art      its not so bad if theyre cheap as fuck like the west does it but japan leaves everything at full price forever except for the occasional sale where theyre slashed to 80 retail at points of time when physical copies are available at 10 of the original price
has the official ost for srw x been uploaded yet or at least a gamerip
  still sales are below older games  srw games should at least sell 1m copies     i dont think you quite understand what sales used to be    the large player base around the world    ha
i just realized what the most shocking possible thing they could do in t is they give heats a new remix
  z2 heats is forever anon
  no the most shocking thing would be the fucking gundams getting something new say everything you will about z2 heats but zeta and cca were in one game more and are still stuck with z2 reuse and the one new song cca got got swept under the rug in the literal second half of the game and never used again    on that note id be a bit shocked if we retain yuusou
bring back kisei 
  the ed getting in would surprise me more
  honestly if they were going to reuse stuff for zeta and cca so much at least reuse the catchy stuff seriously why isnt beyond the time the default reuse for cca its the only catchy tune off of it    any of the zeta ops would work too something other than the stock battle music theyve been using
  srw v announced to have hit over 500000 in sales winning the ps award gold prize and rivalling z1 510000  z1 sold 510k by the end of 2008 v sold 500k after 2 and a half years
  fucking this beyond time is pretty much the theme that comes to mind when one thinks about cca it is bullshit how often main title is the only theme we get out of it
  judging by estimates of physical sales alone with the growing popularity of digital sales is silly these days its not really worth speculating how well a game sold unless a company puts out public numbers for it
2020s game better have greco return
  youll get main title and you will like it  
  its inevitable with the compilation movie
anyone think the 2020 game will have logh
  well if theyre gonna be going through shipsonly series one or two at a time now theyll probably hit it eventually  its setting would pretty much have to be the main core of the games setting though or it would just be super out of place i dont think they could cover the whole show in one go either
  possibly though its a tossup if itll use the novel/anime or the ova version of the storyline on one hand the anime is newer and follows the novels more closely on the other hand the ova is still the most iconic version of the story to fans which might be a reason to choose that instead
2021 30th anniversary game will have yamato 2202 just like 25th anniversary v game had yamato 2199    search your feelings you know it to be true
  it was the best thing in v
  thats what im hoping for actually
  holy shit this is good
  thats the thing with the gc/neo/oe team they made great music for example 
  if were doing pre timeskip this time could we actually see the return of ima ga sono toki da
  fuck you main title is better than beyond the time    only better track they could go with is aurora
  no because that song sucks
cca in t will be getting the return of theme of nu gundam
  the zeta ops might at least be able to claim licensing issues but fucking hell that shows ost has more than the literal same song we get every other goddamn time      or sally    we got nu gundams theme like twice its not going to kill you guys to include that      oes music that wasnt reused from xo or neo tended to be an awful trumpet filled mess the minute vocals got involved but goddamn they mastered the instrumentals
t is a shitty letter    what good letters do we even have left besides g    h is okay i guess maybe i and s
  theyll never use h its a lewd letter
  they can just start using actual words like they did with impact and oe was actually called operation extend
do i have all this right    list of disasters so far    colony drops 16 of australia destroyed including sydney  portion of american midwest  dublin ireland  astral gate accident moon split in two causing generalized depletion of earths atmosphere  nano hazard large swathes of the planet uninhabitable due to rampant nanomachinerelated desertification humans worldwide move to digital existence in deva  shin getter dragon incident getter ray poisoning wipes out large unspecified amount of human population worldwide  e101 drop significant amount of tokyo destroyed and subsequently rebuilt  dr hell/mycene war significant amount of damage to japan photonic energy becomes commonplace power source worldwide  war with jovians jupiter considered to be hostile territory after war alliance between jovian lizards/jupiter empire    majority of human population moves into countrythemed space colonies mars and venus terraformed   senpuuji concern railroads responsible for large amounts of worldwide commerce  infrastructure support
  we will never get h because of the implication
why do nearly all the things/people relating to balmar have hebrew names whose idea was this
  gaun genocider    intentional i think
  because they sound fancy and mystical theres also greek and such mixed in
  jew jokes aside its probably because hebrew feels grandiose as it is also often associated with judaism one of the three abrahamic faiths of the world so by making the balmar have hebrew names we the audience start to associate them with some sense of holy grandeur
  because it sounds cool just like evangelions religious names
  in all seriousness though and jokes aside its probably foreign names sound cooler they abused german like crazy alt eisen and co and og in general general mythology shield of aegis etc hebrew was simply the next step
  oh fuck so all the while its supposed to be romanized as jewdecca damn mneidengard
  will yamato have an og transformable form based on spiral power / getter rays
  no but theyll panel it with hexagons like mazinger z infinity
  you forgot the part of dunbine where shou and was it jeril came back to earth and massacred like 300000 people with aura missiles
  no for the simple reason that how would the game figure out who you side with
  judecca is the name of one of the four parts of the lowest circle of hell in dantes inferno its named after judas
  garalia but we dont actually know when dunbines plot is starting and in any case it would have been pretty recent
  one route starts with the fpa other route starts with the empire partway through the game some big shit goes down and loghs actual plot gets mostly cast aside besides maybe some phezzan/earth cult dickery to focus on the bigger threat at hand
  considering the level of power the balmar empire has and how a simple expeditionary force of theirs nearly brought humanity to its knees then it makes sense for all the names to be hebrew if you see the empire as something of an armies of god attacking mankind
    this is the power of balmar the fearsome bikelane
  im currently watching arcadia of my youth and im about halfway through the tv series and i think ive figured out where it might fit in t assuming they arent just going to throw out its version of the characters backstory and setting like some people think from absence of the illumidas so far     basically it could be post series with illumidas having been driven out of earth sphere relatively recently in the narration in the first episode of the tv seriesssx we get some more setting background than what the movie gave and were told that humanity had been expanding outside the solar system when they encountered the illumidas who proceeded to beat the crap out of and conquer earth which would fit the theme of mans attempts to expand into space failing considering last most successful attempt yet would have ended with encountering hostile alien empire that ended up blocking our expansion and conquering us for a time    ive noticed there doesnt seem to be a whole lot of excitement or speculation on harlocks inclusion here are we here just not familiar with arcadia of my youth or does the lack of villains in the trailer have us assuming there just having him and the arcadia as an alternative transportation to mother vanguard
  hebrew shit is mystic as fuck why not have cool ass mystic stuff
  honestly the decision to not include the illumidas just confuses the fuck out of me and makes me question what on earth is being done with the show and generally speaking if im this confused by something i get put out and tend to discount it from my thought processes    im pretty sure that the noninclusion of illumidas forces is intentional and means that theyre not going to be in t after all it was said that the only reason the green arcadia was chosen was because it was more iconic and maybe having an alien occupation of earth on top of everything else was just considered to be overegging the pudding    i wont mind it as just an alternative to mother vanguard because desu ive never really been that big on the new space battleships in srw thing and i just dont really care a ton
  i want the mother vanguard and the arcadia
  yes would it kill them to actually do something properly with crossbone
  are we here just not familiar with arcadia of my youth  i never seen anything harlock related personally all i know is that hes just a dude who sick and tired of earth and went fuck this
  it seems to me if they wanted both the classic harlock type setting and have the greenskull type arcadia they could of used the outside legendendless odyssey ova from 20022003 as its a pseudo sequel to the original series but features the green arcadiaand completely reboots one tadashis story but only him everbody else still seems to have went through the original series weird i mean arcadia of my youth has more material for them to use but it doesnt look like theyre actually using any of it
lisa kabuto grows up and goes to american to study photons  she ends up falling for a local boy named tommy davis
  itll take effort and not like anyone cares about anything not the titular gundams anyway
is it ok for me to play alpha gaiden without having played alpha 1
  no you must learn moon and play through all possible routes in alpha in order to understand anything at all about alpha gaiden    im just messing with you its a sequel to alpha but all you need to know is that they killed the big bad guy but now the earth is going to get hit by a shockwave soon then everyone fucks off and does their own thing it is a gaiden aka sidestory so it doesnt tie in too closely to the plot of the three main games in the series
speaking of alpha suppose we got a srw beta the rule is that the mc has to be a beta male or a literal cuck aside from shinji who else gets in
  shirogane takeru
  but alpha didnt have only alpha protagonists in fact it had shinji
  infinite stratos
  she would end up falling for takuma nagare instead and then we would finally get mazingetter in far future
  surely you can just play alpha 1 first the translation on it began so long ago that there can be no doubt that its done by now
  well i mean we did get an update this year which is more than could be said for most years
  i get the feeling that the expelled nano hazard and the bebop astral gate accident wont get in and neither will ggundams country colonies but i can believe the others
  if you had just started learning japanese when the project was announced youd have been fluent six years ago and able to play new releases on release  im waiting for you to reply to this post with your excuse /m/
  there are more kanji than there are stars in the sky
  that period of time when dragon quest was getting shafted on translations was almost enough to motivate me to learn but i really half assed it and then they started coming out in english anyways

im surprised aldnoah zero wasnt added in srw t it could totally fit in with cowboy bebop since both shows involve events in which the moon gets shattered
  aldnoah zero  did it get any toys from bandai
  scramble dasshu is now grey  this bothers me far more than any of that jun shit
  that is the new great booster
whens grendizer
  so does it only use the great booster in the movie then no scramble dash
      works with the digimon movie aesthetic
  this is the only way they could possibly bring grendizer back unless they pull off an original grendizer infinity ver or something like that
  great booster wasnt in the movie
opportunity
tfw no shin grendizer anime
  they could bring it back whenever they wanted to its not like dredging up ginguiser where theyd have to record a bunch of new lines from people who are probably already dead    i think the only issue is the same issue with why even the modern version of jeeg hasnt been around lately either no one wants to just have the spazers as attacks but doing them as units would be a lot of work
  the jun stuff really isnt as bad as i first thought it was its mainly confined to first scenes with shirotheres a close up during the scene where you can see her skins dark however and in her scenes with tetsuya weirdly then when they get the lab you see her next to sayaka lisa and kouji and shes noticeably darker than any of them then both her major scenes with seem tetsuya try to obscure her color or something as the flashback to her and tetsuya at their apartment is at sunset and their lights are turned off and at hospital scne at the end tetsuya must have sunburn given how dark he looks    so its more something thats really weird and makes you wonder what was going behind the scenes than a cause for alarm at least its better than what the promos would make you think        ooh nice they designed a movie style great booster since it wasnt actually seen in the movie i didnt think wed get it as an attack in t now we got a chance
  bandais already teased an infinityesque redesign for grendizer   so the later wouldnt be a huge stretch but im not sure id what theyd with it for srw in the toei timeline duke finished his fight and left earth to go bang his sister and repopulate their home planet with incest babies he has no real reason to show up again
  yeah and doctor hell was supposed to be dead too but i guess we cant ever let that card go
  some other group of alien assholesgiven that its srw there plenty we borrow show up and attack forcing him and maria to flee back to earth easy enough
  they come back to earth to borrow kouji and hikaru to make some nonincest babies to help repopulate the planet but they get caught in srw shenanigans and decide to stick around and help their old comrades
  you know it would of been a nice nod to grendizer if they had given hikaru and her dad a cameo somewhere
crossbone dust unit only for next srw
  does that mean wed get victory gundam for plot since last i checked current crossbone series were set around that time
its nice that koujis a dad now even if his daughter has unnecessary anime technicolor hair we need more dad protagonists zoe dolores when
      infinity confirmed that grendizer is not canon thats why there are no references to it
  check out interval peace and book of legend of mazin there are hints of grendizer being somewhere out there
  with mazinger its more like you got alternate timelines than a singular canon besides were discussing the possibility of an infinity style grendizer msvtype thing bandai teased appearing in srw
  his daughter is basically alttimeline rei
  do you mean in mazinger infinity i havent watched it but yes that would have been a nice cameo    as for a reason for duke and maria to return to earth that doesnt involve royal incest babies picture this    our heroes are caught in a horrible situation sadly with the state of modern srw that means that you cleared the stage fast enough to trigger plot and suddenly reinforcements outnumbered cornered on the verge of defeat despite being at almost fully health suddenly a shadow portrait appears in the text box and the following words echo out space thunder    hordes of mooks are defeated in a single blast  whos that one of the newer members asks  could it be asks adult kouji  it couldnt be him tetsuya states taking any opportunity to bring the mood down    grendizer appears on the map    duke greets his old friends and is pleased by how much new blood they have in their ranks    duke hikaru calls out her attraction still there despite the years    some serious minded individual tells them to save the reminiscing for later and to defeat the enemy now    intermission  lots more greetings the old members are happy to see their old comrade back the kids are impressed but not sure what the big deal is one of the younger cast members is a huge grndizer fanboy and spergs out at getting to meet duke fleed and see the grendizer in person    bright interrupts and asks how duke knew they were in trouble    i didnt i promised id come back to visit it took hikaru and i longer than we had expected to find the rest of the survivors from planet fleed and rebuilding fleed with that accomplished we came to visit      i just read the grendizer page on the mazinger wiki and i see that go nagai doesnt consider it part of the mazinger timeline because of disagreements with toei
so is the arhan going to have any special abilities or will it just be a flying scopedog i cant imagine what they could give it going off what was seen in the movie
what if they used ost tracks across different series for based on fit to the scenes rather than using specific tracks for their corresponding series
  so how much does being a writer for srw pay
the hinu is pretty sick and its nice to see that its strongest attack is not locked to amuro
  the adoring praise of five people donate to my patreon    if you want to read my srw fic     however that does remind me that i promised you guys a grendizer fic a year ago and i still havent delivered on that ill get working on that
     anonymous 12/04/18tue073730 no17045134  what if they used ost tracks across different series for based on fit to the scenes rather than using specific tracks for their corresponding series  maybe theyll give angela a uniquely named prevail variant or something
  just because a work follows on from the original canon does not mean it invalidates other works that also follow on from the original canon it just provides an interesting au    z infinity does not make grendizer not canon thats dumb it just means things now go greatgrendizer and great infinity
  sword railgun missiles machingun may be underwelming for a main character but theyve made movesets out of less
somebody promised grechan lewds ages ago where the fuck are they
do you think kouji is jealous that tetsuyas friends with godzilla
i expected ersha to have special dialogue when fighting wataru since hes a kid but nope
  maria was much better in the original series
  no idea it wasnt me im the ppg smut guy 
so when is pv with bgm
  what a damn itty operator
  i look forward to using the black lancelot along with the other new lancelot and guren when the movie gets into srw  and to make my waifu kallen top ace again
  never ever
  damn itty operator  i have no idea what you are talking about
  touya and youta are a fucking antidraw  terada needs to stop pushing those vanilla high schoolers already and put the strap on the adults
  its ogs answer to boss borot
  i need to get the models for this and z    i wish the kaiser kit was in scale with themtoo fuggin small
    again i ask if bandai namco approaches izuru yumizuru and overlap about the idea of infinite stratos in an srw how will it work
the a event in xo has don zauser as one of the enemies    good times had by all
   unnecessary  maybe she just likes dying her hair
  we see her as a toddler thats all natural somehow
ryoma has a son  kouji has a daughter  bc sequel starring amuros unborn child when 
  i think they would be friends with devilman for no reason
  more panel lines and honeycombs    please dont
would boss borot be even stronger with the power of flextape
  thats what happens when you dabble with universe rewriting robots
  infinite stratos  hundred  saijaku bahamut    for the rest  knights and magic  trails of cold steel 1 finale and 2 ending with vermillion apocalypse  xenosaga  xenogears
  with who beltorchika i guess the title is her children after all
  considering we have shion though that must have been ages ago
  speaking of babies whats the name of tetsuya and juns dont think the movie even gives the gender of the baby
  possibilities not even once      or and this is just a theory or thats not the case just like how in c3 you get shion literally the stage after garalia dies

since chase copied a traffic enforcer that means he also copied the body right    why the fuck is that traffic enforcer so ripped the fuck does he do chase violators on foot
do you think gentoku should have stayed and died as a villain
  in a sense he did    start off as a good person  gets corrupted and begins becoming the thing he wanted to fight  lost everything he was fighting for becoming a slave to the system  eventually comes back to his senses and fights against the true enemy once again
  implying gentoku was ever wrong
  enemies end up beating him because he basically has trex arms and can only slightly swipe ahead of him with his arms at his sides at best
onore decado
  not really there was no space for a serious human villain towards the 2nd half of build due to evolt ruling over everything and intending to destroy the plant mad rogue already felt really underwhelming adding a 2nd one wouldnt have improved anything

this is the bat transteam suit night rogue  say something mean about him
  you were kind of an okay character until the writers decided to turn you into nothing but a gag tshirt salesman then you just went downhill hard

1st movie winter 2019    pv airing together with nt
saved    by    newtype    magic
  didnt air at my cinema and i stayed till the lights came on there are tons of angry replies to the tweet too hopefully this means the stupid fuckers will just put it up online
  1st movie winter 2019  waita fucking year
  its as if you expect them to shit out these things in a matter of just months    no shit its a year from now
  so in less than 3 months cause thats winter 2019 in seasonal anime terms
  you do realise that winter 2019 is like this coming february right
    isnt it november 19
  movie  tv anime season    dumb spic
  november is autumn in japan winter is decemberfebruary and the year is jan/febs
so wheres that trailer boys
    they will equip xi with psychoframe wont they 
  yeah though i thought it already had one  or was that just a psycommu system
  yeah i think it was psycommu
  we wont see that asshat kick the bucket till the end of 2021  well that sucks speaking of things to come when is the origin tv happening again is there any chance in hell they could continue it after they reach the end of the ova stuff
  hopefully not
  mark my words xi will glow green and shoot psycho shockwaves out of its hands
  are you sure
  is tomibro directing it or not
  just get katoki to do the redesign to add it he handled fixing the nu gundam pretty good
  i mean it looks as is in the op image
what are the chances that fukuis selfinsert fanfic character will make a cameo or plays a role in this thing
  you mean banagher higher than it should be
  while the ova was still being released yas said that if sunrise wasnt going to commit to adapting all of it he was throwing in the towel for good on any attempt on his part to get it animated and any involvement from him with anime in general shortly afterwards sunrise confirmed that was all they had planned    they havent announced any staff yet but no i wouldnt imagine he is
  excuse you fixing the nu fuck off with that green vomit
  and theyll probably shoehorn zeon in somewhere somehow    if they keep hathaways character right and the ending close to the book the last episode will be hilarious
  wont get to see bright fall into despair until 2021
  arent the other members of muftis organization former zeons
  is it mufty mufti or mafty
  since its named after a specific islamic term it should be mufti
  i mean like the actual embroidered green uniform wearing zeeks like the sleeves not former members
  kill em all tomino comes back for one final rodeo  the advertising would be amazing
  he already came back for recognista
  same goes with uso/usso ewin/ebin/ebbing
ichiro itano should direct
  we need to go with the dumbest one so uso ebin
  ebin  uso is from kasarelia finland  perkele v gundam has the deepest lore
  is hathaway like 7 tall or something his torso is super long
  thats just a really long shirt like the ones fuccbois wear nowadays its all the rage with the kids
  looks like his pilot suit seems that it could be a little redesigned while keeping stuff like the shoulder pads but the big change seems to be the baggy long top but i have a feeling its able to be tightened and shrunk or something for when hes ready to go in his mobile suit
  u so ebin
  wearing sunglasses and fat  gihren and not degwin    whoever made this really missed it
armor suit thread
sure
  its such a shame section 8 got buried by gfwl there was a ton of wasted potential it was like a battlefield game but you dropin from low orbit in your badass powersuit that runs as fast as a car
fresh oc from my paint booth coming through
  shame we never got vanquish 2
  i wonder if kamiya will ever get to make the his notcasshern game revengeance was closer but wolf was barely in the game after his fight
  the mk v was the bestlooking
best armor  but lacks plot armor
i prefer this one
organic power armor a best
  what is this from
  trash memory of the final champion
    why the hell does it have a visor on the jaw
  it opens up so he can eat and talk loudly without having to remove armor his helmet is one of those sensor masks
  and smoking which is also a game mechanic
  memories broken
  traitor of mars really was the best theyve ever done at putting the marauder on screen as its described in the book the suit here is a lot smaller and less clunky than the book describes it but the way it moves and acts is exactly how i pictured it when i read the book
  the starship troopers ova does the most justice to the novel descriptions they also look awesome
  i kind of prefer the tabletop version
  wheres that from
would titanfall armor count as power armor they have some kind of weird interweave body connecting shit underneath the outer clothing so i would assume so
     how tall is master chief
  610 without armor 72 in armor spartan iis are crazy messed up
    i really like armors with shoulder cannons post more of them
  probably they seem to punch way harder than a normal human
    came into this thread hoping to see starship troopers ive always dreamed of a live action tv series closely based on the novel featuring the armored suits seaons 1 and/or 2 could be the events of the novel ending with operation royalty and then they could do original stories after that
  the source is on the pic lol
  this pic is really flattering to the t60
salamanders represent
  reminder that crisis 3 is /m/ as fuck and worth looking at for the player character alone
  truth the mp was some of the most fps fun i had in years did boots on the ground better than blops by a long shot i loved running the sniper and revolver
  the truth goes unspoken
  sequel playing as sam literally never
  truly the greatest tragedy in recent videogame history
  recent video game history is a tragedy
  play mgr  decide to check out vanquish  think the main character looks like sam  is literally called sam  thanks platinum
  tfw all these armors and other franchise suits got ported into xcom 2 so you can make your guys into spartans titanfall pilots clone troopers helghasts and big boss
  super jew amour
  reminder that 343 saw all of this and decided it wasnt good enough this art style this look
  still waiting for a true custom campaign where you can play only war on xc2
    now check anarchy reings  see if anything looks familiar
  i wonder if it circumcises the wearer
  why did they go with jewish super science again why couldnt they have gone with aliens or demons like the previous titles
    the growing narrative in the games is leading up to the creation of the uae from what ever will happen after youngblood the uberghwer is a protobfg 9000 and the technology that they are using the nazis are tracing elements the will lead to the last conflict happening on mars in short wolfenstein will bleed into doom
i always wondered why so many power armor type designs always have the head inside the chest     wouldnt that just make them really easy to head shot just aim center mass
whats some more android/power armorcore ive seen  casshan franchise  ergo proxy  started kikaider  started karas  also played vanquish
i somehow never picked up any good active raid art
  ive heard this is a legit 1/10 why are people down on it
  you heard wrong chum
  the fact you havent heard why its supposedly bad kind of speaks volumes does it ive never heard any substantial criticisms of the show just  bad show with no redeeming characteristics   or so some vague shitposting about bad characters and ear rape music     its basically a police procedural about a ragtag team of power armor operators trying to deal with law enforcement in world that was suddenly changed due to a new technology being introduced     i can see why its not everyones cup of tea but i found nothing egregiously wrong with the show the characters are solid and they all get some degree of development despite being a fairly large ensemble cast even the bridge bunny the barely talks gets an episode to flesh her out the show is a mix of stand alone episodes and a loose plot running in the background that ties things up in the final run down like the 90s series it emulates some of the stand alone eps are really good like the giant robot nolstalgia ep others kind of fall flat the dog gets captured ep id say its more of a 6/10
  fuck those look horrible  say no to film powerrangerification      the game ost was on point  but damn that artwork looked horrible  i liked more the sprite
  rip and tear 
  i still think 2 is better great soundtrack too but yeah crysis is /m/ as fuck
  vanquish  revengeance  kamiya  wut
  unga bunga bunga unga me stylish leo   me good  me like fab
  dude cant handle rushdowns  come on dude
  unga bunga bunga me also play elephant
  just git gud my dude
putting people in a suit    lolz
      it wasnt bad but it was also one of the planet with shitposters previous targets he has a hateboner for anything with cgi among other things
rip in peace at43
mind if i cut in
  superb taste
  kamiya had nothing to do with either game its more likely atsushi inaba producer for both games was the one into the idea at one point vanquish was gonna be casshern meets space sheriff and you can still see leftovers of the latter in the game
tfw no casshern game with the characters and license  tfw the casshern franchise is excellent but dead
  why the hell does it have a visor on the jaw    its mainly to protect the lower part of the wearers face from debris and air lash and may possibly be used as part of a sealed environmental system     while external surroundings maybe viewed through the helmet via internal monitors or possibly microprojectors beaming images directly into the eyeballs a simple sturdy seethrough material is a lowtech solution to minimizing impedance of peripheral vision to maximize the field of view and since the wearer wont be seeing the real scenery with their naked eyes anyway this allows the upper part of the helmet to have more armor to reinforce the upper part of the face offering more protection than a conventionallydesigned helmet
  wolf was barely in the game after his fight    he literally had his own level with a boss and everything
  2 was when the story got all fucky
  big black muscly powersuit    how can mchbois even compete
    bunch of casuals vanquish was the idea of no other than shinji mikami the guy behind resident evil and god hand he doesnt work at platinum anymore so any potential sequel already lost a lot of credibility but id be interested anyway because it is easily one of my favorite games    also related to the thread cant believe no one posted motherfucking tekkaman blade
  why go with the endall powersuit if we can slowly escalate until now nothing posted was canonically able to witstand a nuke to the fucking face  sidenote what would furis stranger be a cyborg a powered suit freak he also get a motoslave type of upgrade later in game for the final boss  but stilll what category is he on
  when does this pick up im not sure what i expected when i started but its pretty slow so far
  i like this design quite a bit it is simple but also looks flexible and the rounded sloping plates will redistribute the energy of impacts
artificial muscle fibers are my fetish
    too bad for the cartoon network curse
  thats just a jet pack this is an armor thread
mark iv best mark aesthetics wise
its a great powered armor in halo too bad it jobbed by a sticky bomb
  i respect your opinion but disagree
  this was piloted in the short not sure if it has a canon size
  wolfenstein is a prequel to doom  by the primes it all makes sense
      i dont care what people say about reach  the tacticool armor look was great especially compared to the abominations in 45
  i thought early doom chatter had doomguy being the descendant of bj blazkowicz
  canon size or not its a pretty cool concept
  the boot heels really put me off those designs because the leg itself seems too narrow to fit the actual foot in any way other than pointed the thought makes me cringe
i love they made full use of royo even though none of his art actually fit the game
  vanquish was the idea of no other than shinji mikami  anon the platinum blog entries referencing the development of the games flat out credit inaba on frequent occasions and the only developer link between vanquish and mgr where you get the robot dog who outright joins raiden for the casshern pose and came out long after mikami left is atsushi inaba
tfw no proper casshan game  it hurts bros
    this was always the idea        the going indicators are now teasing that bethesda will make bj the doom guy the tech the nazis are using via secret jewish group is related to some shit that will lead to mars all rumor and conjecture but the last battle with hitler will take place in this temple on mars
  i so cannot unsee inspiration from the buster assault v gundam with those two weapon pods on top     stand up to the victory also matches with the murrica theme of war machine
what are some other action packed /m/ games like vanquish
    i dont really know many like vanquish but crysis is some good fps that really makes it feel like you are running around in a powerful suit
  enough to fuck an elite up those are even taller by the way
  they needed to be freakishly huge and strong just to not get killed by their own armor apart from other training and conditioning they managed to find a more economic and less invasive balance with the spartan iiis
  these kinds of shoes are fetish gear in real life theyre called ballet boots
  thanks im going to have nightmares now
  my point was that mikami was the lead on vanquish and it was his idea originally regardless of inabas contributions there is an interview with mikami where he talks about wanting to recreate the speed of something like casshern in the game    inaba probably contributed a lot being the producer and that but the game was mostly mikamis
  looks familliar what is it from
  my bro is making a bet with me that the upcoming halo infinite the final battle has chief piloting that against the final boss and making the classic escape with it too    his idea not mine
  i think anything punching through that much armor isnt going to wound someone so much as just leave a tunnel through them
    im a different anon  could you take a look on the guys that did anarchy reigns because that feels totally like  not mgr but with crappy hiphop
jinraiger was already dead but i guess this kinda confirms it
  f    f for jinrai too
  shit i guess some of the signs were there for failing health he spent the first couple months this year hospitalized for undisclosed issues they officially closed the streamed talks in june or july after not having any updates since before the start of the year and the discussions on the news site had been on hiatus since september  i wonder what it means for the project at the very least i hope the artist who was doing the manga on niconico continues according to the drafted story
  rip
  a shame both for the man and for the project
f
    official tweet seems to say future is undetermined but im not hopeful he was the main driving force behind it which is a shame
      this is really tragic i wish he would have gotten to make his final braiger related project
  rest in peace
he was the writer on three of my favorite episodes and on several of the most iconic episodes of msg    f
    he is also a legend in the tatsunoko ranks yatterman gachaman and polymar were some of his brainchilds rip steve and stan is waiting to share their stories with you in the afterlife

best getter team
we gundam seed soon the first gen of coordinators had been born in real life
  what
  hes referencing the completely offtopic news about china claiming to have gene edited a baby thats completely unverified by anyone even within china let alone the international scientific community
bootleg chinese people  jesus christ how horrifying
  further note lots of academic papers published in chinese journals are mysteriously unreplicable
  oh genetic engineering  shit like that been done in years  its was only kept under wraps
  theyre lying in the information they give out to keep the technology a secret now china will rule the world with their super biologically perfect soldiers soon
  now china will rule the world with their super biologically perfect soldiers soon  be realistic here anon  you dont think the us europe russia and so on isnt doing this as well like i said this isnt new to me
  cant have biologically perfect people if theyre raised in one of the most polluted environment on the planet
this is going to be mass effect gene therapy and augmentation in the next decade or two mary my words
the coordinators era is nearly closed   but i doubt about china its just a fucking propaganda like the space carer   rip newtypes sorry uc fans
  sadly that true of all scientific studies anymore
  all we have to do is wait for peta to become blue cosmos honestly its not much of a stretch
  they kinda need to clone due to the lack of women
  so you are telling me in 3 generations they will be falling apart 
  
  the long time onechild policy plus the need for a male to carry on the family resulted in many years of discarding female children leading to an imbalance in the population
    oh no a mutant chinaman with a relatively massive 4 inch dick and a faint semblance of a soul tremble with fear
  rich get super babies while poor get left behind   wasnt there an hg wells book about this
  the time machine
  it kinda surprises me that the chinese arent already all disgustingly mutated freaks due to the pollution being subhuman antpeople has its advantages i guess
  it is a frustratingly general problem yes the situation with chinese journals is substantially worse
  gataca
  but newtypes has always been here it just we dont have minovsky physics to build ms
  all the ms in gs uses batteries which china is also one of biggest producers in the world
  so itll be clone wars but also what if we throw mechs or just exoskeletons in the mix things could get really bad but interesting
  everyone still dies in nuclear fire
  he never heard of weaponized autism
    so its less coordinators and more kuntala
  this is going to be mass effect gene therapy and augmentation in the next decade or two mary my words  i figure as much well have medical gene therapy for everyone in 20302050 augmentation might be to if they allow it
why stop there  
  who
  where
  rip newtypes sorry uc fans  my fondest hope is for my grandchildren to be child soldiers in mechs
  strange how taiwanese chinamen actually act like humans while chinese chinamen act like strange bugcreatures
  fast food changes your genes too
  fujo tieria fangirl vs stacy lacus afficionado
  im pretty sure the vatican was mad at cern for publishing a paper about creating fetuses in aritificial wombs over a decade ago it is nothing knew i wouldnt be surprised if babies from the 90s were genetic altered at this point
  its the same person after some serious diet
  not when your genes have been spliced with a cockroach
  it literally is bootleg anyone who knows anything about crispr knows that using it is basically the equivalent of hiring some dumb college freshman to program your site for you
  you need an artificial incubator to make them perfect but theres always a natural who outmatches the modified ones
  when
ok /m/ im turning to you for this one what exactly is this kikaijus name me and a friend have looked for it in mazinger z infinity and it only seems to show up in crowd scenes its nowhere in the concept art and were scratching our heads as to why it was chosen for z is it important does it have a history was it in another srw game what the heck is it even
er chosen for srw even
its goufy time  
i wanna get into gundam is there a guide or whatever the fuck of essentials i should watch
  posting this garbage still    heres the real chart
  original gundam series then z and then chars countratack  f91 if you want more and new elements and unicorn if you want more about the original cast and conflict  turn a and g reco if you like color and happy shit but first s original series
  original gundam series then z and then chars countratack  he didnt explicitly say gundam anime so you really should include the gundam zz the vietnamese stage play because of the plot holes it closes up from zeta to cca
  this guy knows
  go watch aldnoah zero instead its way better than gaydumb
  msg  zeta  cca  unicorn tv series not ova    thats the meat and potatoes of the lore    after that gundam wing for the memes 8th ms team  thunderbolt  igloo to round out the uc timeline and then ibo if you want something more modern and hip with the zoomers
people here are going to say watch in production order dont listen to them everything tomino directed is autistic and badly animated   watch 08th ms team war in the pocket and then maybe stardust memories but skip through to the action scenes because the plot is shit
pick an au you think looks cool i started with 00 then production order if you liked an au 00 is entirely on youtube not bd quality i think but still decent
  do you not actually need to watch zz
  vietnamese stage play  care to explain
  people love to hate it for some reason its up to you its the least favorite of mine of the original tomino stories but its still nice
  because its not an anime
  if you want the neozeon conflict and kamille to get an actual resolution you do
  if you can watch it in production order and once you are done with cca see if you want to continue on the same way or just pick anything that catches your interest
  he doesnt need to watch zeta either isnt it
  your mothers fetid cunt needs to shat in to wash out the stink you and your shit taste in /m/ left behind when she farted you out
  i want to violently hug and kiss rosamia badam
  rosamia badam  more like  rosamia bottom
  unf those lips 3
  badam literally means nut in persian  i want to but inside her
while its understandable why no faction past cca would want to make psycommu weapons why didnt they pursue the semi psycommu such as incoms they seem pretty useful enough as seen with the doven wolf
  zz is not canon
  finicky  expensive  tough to train for  too similar to newtypes/funnels so a stigma is involved    any numbe of reasons
  the contios shot claws are basically incoms
beam rifles get absurdly strong and their isnt very much advantage to wire guided systems unless they are really goddamn long
  more angles of attack  area coverage  point defense
  thing is area coverage is fucking impossible in 3d combat where things can maneuver as fast as mobile suits and more angles of coverage is also mediocre as you arent limited at all in how you aim if your mobile suit can reorient itself properly these things seem useful because gundam has the mobile suits fight at extremely close range when there is too much raw space to move around in for sword to sword combat to actually be relevant
incoms are slower and more limited in movement compared to funnels and if the wire theyre attached to is cut then theyre useless     considering how unicorn and nt are setting things up anything newtype related whether it be psycommu or biological research is probably going to end up as taboo as nukes in the ucverse since its got to the point that whenever something newtype related is involved anymore spacetime gets ripped with the loss of super expensive equipment or abominations of biological science and crimes against humanity are carried out on someone sometimes both
shoot/cut wire  welp
  i love this line of mobile suits
    the same could be said of an ms limb/barrel  but enough talk have at you
  22m height    damn mobile suits got big during the zz era
once im done with all things gundam i want to branch out to some other mecha evangelion is on the list but i vaguely remember my dad watching this when i was a kid is it good
  how old are you
  29 i consider under 18 to be a kid
  its eva but made by bones with inconsequential bible references replaced by inconsequential music theory references and best girl wins also the eva manga stole rahxephons ending so theyre even
  watch fafner
  im in the same boat originally watched tokyo jupiter with my dad when it came out and a couple moments really stuck with me for years until a decade later when i came back and revisited it proper it was actually better than i remembered it too    make sure you buy a case of ramune before you watch it though
  watch fafner
  no watch evangelion instead of this bullshit
  go back to /a/frica
its eva but with far far far better characters and mesoamerican references instead of (((kabbalah)))
    whats so eva about it
  its verrrrrrry obviously aesthetically and tonally based on eva    the actual story and characters though not really
  its verrrrrrry obviously aesthetically and tonally based on eva    sigh
  read the entire post
  i did
  it is one of the worst anime ive ever seen im not usually that hyperbolic but the whole thing felt like directoral masturbation there are huge amounts of meaningless dialogue no tension in fight scenes since rahxephon never gets damaged plot threads that never go anywhere the works     most bones original shows are like this theyre all garbage but rahxephon is particularly bad since unlike something like eureka seven theres not even any logical inferences that can be made things just seem to happen and theres no substance in the show that would help you to understand why they happen or why any of it matters its just shit
  if anyone should go to /a/ its you dumbass namefag you might learn something
  plot threads that never go anywhere  no substance in the show that would help you to understand why they happen  hit me i want to hear some examples to me it sounds like youre one of those people who simply chose to not pay attention while watching the show
  well it has been a few years but ill try  i remember an arc about certain characters being clones that had nothing to do with anything else and never really resolved i remember the mentioning of a bahbem foundation or something like that as a supposed orchestrator of the events of the show but there was almost no detail given as to who they were or why they were doing anything    of course the show revolved around the whole tuning thing but i dont recall it being explained how that worked either  the dolems were a huge fixture of the show and we never got any detail on what they were that i remember for sure  i vaguely remember an episode where quon girl who never speaks a single line that can actually be understood in the entire show gets trapped in some sort of dimensional void or something and then mc goes to try to get her out of said void and then gets trapped himself and by the end of the episode theyre just out of the void after several scenes of meaningless philosophy babble with no real explanation as to what happened    that last one is a pretty good summary of how the show is overall i feel
  that had nothing to do with anything else and never really resolved  this ones already brilliant a guy runs a secret organization and makes clones i wonder what they are supposed to do maybe run the organisation in question they were cloned to do the jobs bahbem told them to do thats why the clones have ranks isshikis entire character arc you even get an entire episode that spoonfeeds this to you e15 explains that hes an inferior clone who was always trying to prove his worth thats what the flashback episode is partially about     but there was almost no detail given as to who they were or   yep you didnt pay any attention bahbem was shown multiple times with helena who had a hand together with isshiki in running terra they are counteracting mayas mulians this is shown dozens of times throughout the show e6 shows bahbem talk to shirow and kunugi the people who run terra they thank him for his contribution and say that terra wouldnt have been possible without him e14 introduces mechs e15 shows you that it was the bahbem foundation the ones who finance terra who made and developed the mechs for 20 years     explained how that worked either  its pretty clearly explained in e25 ayato specifically tells haruka that he more or less ascended to godhood do you want them to break it down into physics formulas the show makes it very clear that for the retuning of the world two instrumentalists are required its also stated and shown that itsuki and helena used to be potential instrumentalists but got too old over time just imagine for it to be like the apocalypse so chosen ones fight winner retunes the world     1/3
    on what they were  claim controlled by the respective individual they are literally golems from the hebrew dolem is damaged clay breaks apart pilot dies they are clay mechs that make their master die alongside them this was unironically shown like a dozen times once again e15 elaborates on them quite a bit and shows that the bahbem foundation experimented with them to make them usuable by mere humans which they then turned into the vermillion units bahbem had the knowledge because hes mulian himself shown in e25 when he gets show blue blood 3 seconds long cut in e6 he even has a conversation about preparing the planned number and the guy he talks to says their practical application while the characters stare at a golden tablet with mesoamerican origin depicting a big monster/xephon     gets trapped in some sort of dimensional void   the existence of the shrine was already spoilered in e6 its even said that it allowed terra to get their hands on some valuable mulian artifacts as far as i am concerned the shrine itself is brought up to hammer home the point that the mulians possess the power to manipulate time and that they have multiple ways to do so hence why people were spirited away after entering it they are not forced to create a field such as tokyo jupiter this bit is further enhanced by the fact that they a entered it to find reika soul of the rahxephon and b find her inside     i also think youre overplaying this i didnt remember this sequences being particularly long so i checked how long it actually was they enter at 12 minutes and leave by 19 the time that shows them actively wandering around in the shrine is less than 2 minutes though     2/3
    from a story standpoint it actually introduces the fact that quon ayatos mother is the other instrumentalist required for the tuning process since nobody else can actually enter it also kinda implies that only people with mulian blood can which is why haruka sees nothing but a wall of rocks     all of this can be extracted from the show from the dialogue and from the visual queues i dont even need to refer to the databooks here so this seems to be a classic case of someone calling something shit that they never bothered to give a genuine shot dont take this the wrong way but given your posts this sounds like you already formulated your opinion on the show prior to having finished the first episode    3/3
  watch argento soma
  maybe you love this show and watched it dozens of times but your posts are full of much clearer language than was actually used by the show for example    ascended to godhood  in rahxephon speak would be  the ixtli acquiring its true face    or some bullshit like that maybe your fascination with the show has allowed you to translate all these vague phrases into something coherent but dont assume the same is true for everyone this is why i say the show is substanceless and that it is difficult to infer what is going on and for all your studying even you still make some inferences in your posts and are not completely sure what happened yourself     and quite frankly it was the exact opposite of your parting words id only heard praise for the show before i watched it but the only praise i can give it is the animation and music
  watch godannar and gravion and the seasons following it
   ixtli acquiring its true face  actually no the episode is literally titled gods uncertain music you also chose to cut off part of the quote     i mean it also shows him getting shot a bunch of times and absorbing the bullets while talking about the true purpose of the rahxephon the episode is titled god hes called a god he cant die and he says to hes not human anymore and cant go back to being one again not sure what you want the show to do have him wear tshirt that states god    it is difficult to infer what is going on  clearly not most information is being spoonfed its just not spoonfed in the same episode as the episode that resolves the mystery its addressing see the vermillions storyline e6  e14  e15  e24  e25 if you dont make these connection then its just random events thats not the shows problem however its the viewers inability to keep track of the sideplots i personally think that this is one of the problems of bingewatching    not completely sure  some things simply are left to interpretation barely any of the things ive stated are interpretations though even the ones that are hardly are    example take asahinas mech in e19 its never specifically stated that she is bound to it because its the dolem made for her but it is heavily implied by a the hood shes wearing a hoody b the dolems soul/ghost that rests on her back being the spitting image of her and c the dolem carrying the color scheme that asahina has sported throughout the show rose clothing the visual queues imply them so hard that itd be illogical to assume something else so technically speaking the show tells you whats going on through visual queues the audience simply needs to be openminded enough to spot them     only heard praise  not sure where you heard praise i only ever see people who are unable to follow plotlines
  i couldnt get past the first few episode does it get better    rahxephon is fucking awesome so far
  not him but youll have to endure 18 bad episodes to get to the 26 goodgreat episodes exodus
  fafner goes from bad to average after they dump the first writer about 11 episodes in but time is still spent making up for that and the visuals dont really change everything after the first series prequel ova sequel movie and sequel tv series are excellent
  its weird mecha show about a boy with emotional issues who is forced to fight weird monsters in a robot thats probably not just a robot and the ending is weird too
  mazinger
  i know its supposed to be inspired by reideen but fuck me like a whore it felt like it copied from evas textbook far more throughout my entire time with it i kept seeing the similarities in scenario writing visual motifs etc
  does it get better  its bizzare how much better fafner gets as a franchise as it goes on
  why do people hate the first 11 episodes those have all the nice sol moments that build up the characters and it has some great individual episodes like exploring the abandoned island shoukos episode and hirotos aidoru protest
  watch aquarion
  similarities in scenario writing  i dont even agree with the guy you responded to but this is just laughable scenario writing in nge youre comparing a show that was constructed in a lab to one that was written on the go rahxephons narrative development and focus the thoroughness of its world building the characters and their respective exposition arent even similar beyond extremely superficial levels many episodes that might resemble nge are literally taken from raideen like the episode of the two similarly colored angels that attack in the same episode additionally the elemental dolems are homages to raideen as well as show that was first and foremost focused on elemental monsters that show ice or lightning or sound the protags father being a scientist who runs a secret organization the mother who is a superior being who controls a secret civilization none of this had to be taken from nge it was already present in raideen    from a visual standpoint sure izubuchi might say that he didnt take anything from nge but id say that he did however since you clearly havent seen raideen or many mecha shows for that matter i reckon you wouldnt be able to tell the similarities between those shows though introspective experiences were also present in raideen the ending sequence is just copy pasted from birth anno did not invent overshoulder shots either      wow so raideen huh do you seriously believe that evangelion introduced the nonmecha mechs and opponents as well as the struggling teen protagonist to the genre or someting
  so is raideen good
  no its monster of the week without a proper narrative sure there a bunch of mysteries like gatlantis superior humans whose civilization vanished who made the raideen unit who are led by akiras mother which makes him a crossbreed the same as ayato but all in all its just very repetitive superrobo schlock the first half they fight lesser elemental monsters made from stones the second half they fight bigger combinations of monsters they resemble the dolems in concept and attacks but it really isnt worth watching unless you a like this really tropeheavy subgenre or b want to see where rahxephon took many its ideas from the superficial similarities are hilarious though its like watching a shit ton of mecha and then watching nge you start to realize that the bulk of the ideas isnt even remotely original even the protags girlfriend flying a jet was taken from raideen wouldnt recommend for you to waste your time unless you have a fabel for rahxephon in which case id tell you to read churchwards books on finding/believes regarding the lost continent of mu and the nacaal first that at least teaches you something raideen doesnt
  yes but it has incomplete subs
  there are many issues with it on a first watch it tries too hard to keep the viewers in the dark and leaves too much unexplained or unknown thats why they had an entire episode to infodump immediately after the writer swap instead of spacing it out over those episodes the large cast of characters introduced off the bat or killed right away make it hard to know who is who especially with the hirai designs like rewatching it i can enjoy it but only because i already know whats going on
  rahxephon is great i liked it a whole lot more than evangelion        rahxephon owes more to reideen based on the design of its mecha and its themes but i say the psychoanalysis and psychological themes in eva could be found in rahxephon as well that i dont think the comparisons arent apt
tfw only favorite mecha design is the xram004fa armorlion  tfw no one will ever make a figurine of it
  all the more reason i hope they make more og anime
 guy has ptsd because of the girl who died 10 years ago   suddenly he found out that she isnt really dead but is mecha phenex now  how is this gonna to end  1 the girl mecha will be destroyed and the guy will give up and move on  2 the girl will be destroyed and the guy will hang himself  3 he gonna ride her wildly then theyll just go to jupiter together and make some mobile sex doll with usb for her  3a or theyll go back in time and save the girl from mad scientists  4 shell go back in time alone and make sure that the guy will never meet her
  2 or 4
    where r u getting that the guy has ptsd    also   the phonex defeats the 2nd neo zeong taking the last remaining evidence of newtypes with it to the next dimension
  where r u getting that the guy has ptsd  its obvious from trailers and posters
  they should have animated blue destiny ffs
  this finally someone who understands my pain
  no it just looks like the same newytpe human sensitivity connection over dead people thats prevalent in gundam
  this is a ripoff of 15 different gundam novels sunrise are such hacks
  shes going be in the robot not the robot itself i would expect her to be unable to leave the robot or paralyzed or something if she can
  interview with the staff about graphics  also some new screens
  mecha graphics will be mix between cg and handdrawings
didnt the novel come out today need those spoilers
  zeonic has half the novel spoilers up
  not phenex hunt you dipshit this novel that just came out    
  yes it is the nt novel you fucking cockknocker         general revil gets sunk in helium 3 reserve base explosion freaking hilarious
  protag literally fucks his mecha waifu  /m/ still not pleased  goddammit /m/
  she isnt really dead but is mecha phenex now  oh shit thats the kid in the pv getting her skull opened up
    it was supposed to be michelle too but its illustrating the tests they conducted on potential newtypes
  to be fair to that guy its not exactly right there on zeonics home page
    you sure your cache isnt messed up it was posted yesterday
  so anyone willing to post a summary of the novel here
  are you that lazy or inept you cant click a link to it
  she isnt really dead but is mecha phenex now  so shes literally a gundam god i wish that were me lucky girl
  fuck off setsuna
  oh ffs general revil ship cant catch any breaks can it
  go to bed setsuna
  this is weird the gundam nt novel is an adaptation of the movie isnt it
  she becomes his arm    no one going to get thsi
  behold guns of the patriots
  implying she wont be a brain in a jar wired up directly to the phenex    i did not say this  i am not here
  ii neo zeong    fucking whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
  he will go beyond the time
  bionic commando
  new trailer
  the high heat and shock waves wash over the ii neo zeong as well but it is protected by the psycho field nothing is left near zoltan space is silent except for his laugh  this is fucking ridiculous i love it
  huh has this gundamtype been shown or mentioned before this trailer
  silver bullet
how does the phenex still have fuel
  newtype magic or maybe it breaks into colonies and steals spacenoids fuel
  so great another neo zeon war this time over the phenex
  at least the villain has more personality this time around    weliveinasociety emogoth  fanfictionnet notchar
  fucking hell another unicorn why why make this one a damn unicorn as well
  unicorn  theyre called singularity one now
  yes
  seems that nips in the twitter agree with that statement
  judging by the newtype aura around it im gonna hazard it uses telekinesis like banagher was moving his shields against ff
  incity fighting like the beginning of f91  yes  yes
  you fucking what
      also present in her room is brick who is manipulating images on a large screen on the wall it is secret imagery captured by the federations military surveillance cameras last year its footage of the unicorn gundam demonstrating remarkable success in battle however no one refers to it as the unicorn gundam anymore but instead by the name singularity one michelle responds by calling it a technological singularity
  if you read the novel summary youd learn that its the narrative with the psycho package on it
  as if i couldnt hate fukui and the unicorn novel ova whatever series more than i already do god im mad thanks for explaining it to me though
  so thats the secret cpack
  i mean i dont mind it the summary alone is more entertaining than unicorn i just wonder how the whole thing will tie into f91 and victory
do you want to know how i got these scars
  well i doubt it will tie in very nicely hathaways flash will tell though most likely theyre gonna make the victory f91 and crossbone machines psychoframe units as well
  they kind of already did in the recent model kit info sections while also partially acknowledging the canonicity of crossbone via mp f91s  multiple construction armor  multiple construction armor mca is a multifunctional structural material in which the functions of electronic equipment such as circulatory and cooling systems are incorporated into the ms armor layers making more efficient use of the highly compact ms limited internal space148 the technology for embedding electrical functions into a structural material is first established in uc0090s with the development of the psychoframe49 mca is an application of this technology after further development it uses special structural materials alongside heterogeneous crystallization coupling technology that uses ifields19 this feature is removed in the production version of gundam f91910  metal peeloff effect  this special feature of the gundam f91 is a byproduct of the mca8 in addition to its radiators and cooling ducts the f91 can also dissipate excess heat by shedding the outer layers of its armor8 this process creates afterimages of the mobile suit made up of metallic particles which can deceive not only the eyes of enemy pilots but also radar and other sensors678 this feature is activated when the suit is in the full operating mode and only present in the prototype version of the gundam f9113610
  judging how they talked about whether the unicorn was disassembled or not im gona guess the psycho package is actually the disassembled unicorn or at least some parts of it
  i see
  a ballpoint pen
  forgotten like newtypes
  uddenly he found out that she isnt really dead but is mecha phenex now  so its blue destiny but shit
  that pilot suit though
  i love over the top bad guys
chris   
  a chick named eric
  bianca
  second neo zeong  why    also besides those jegans and maybe that dijeh is there going to be grunt action at all in this hoping for a little more geara zulu action they didnt get enough love in unicorn
  what the how many funds do these zeeks have to build another neo zeong unit
  shell be like ein or something
  the vase was really expensive ok
  problem with space colonization is anyone and everyone can grab an asteroid and mine it for trillions of shekels    you also have a significantly bigger and harder to support population which means theres always demand for all sorts of products not that hard to run shell corporations as has been shown by literally any organization in uc history
  at least the remnant is getting weaker     this time they have an old off brand cyber newtype jacking an off brand sinanju with no battleship and very limited support no fleet it makes sense that they have the money for oneoff super weapons through old funding channels especially because it isnt a new design
  they have a battleship n
  silver bullet  beam magnum    watch this be piloted by banana
hey at least mc isnt a pussy and is a trained pilot
  hey at least i like eating shit
  meanwhile the garancieres jr was monitoring the situation as well from the shadows zinnerman asks what is going on and takuya tells him that no one knows what is going on as such they head towards the situation the silver bullet is on standby in the hangar  banana
  more colony drop type shit  the entire neo zeong 2 fight  who the fuck greenlighted this
this movie is gonna be fucking amazing
  not colony drop colony damage
  you mean fukui who wrote the novel and worked on adapting this too hes a fucking hack i cant believe he gets work
  are you forgetting zz where judau makes the zz gundam fly around with pure rage its at least not the most egregious thing but it looks like phenex and neo zeong ii are about to literally warp dimensions to a different plane of existence
  its almost as if its printing money and they want more of it
  i get the impression fukui wants us to realize psycoframe is some goddamn crazy shit
  problem is we dont know of any new mining asteroids controlled by zeon its not like its a small operation all of axis was a single mining asteroid that was mining since before the oyw and they were a small nation onto themselves the remnants are supposed to be leftovers of leftovers
  whats that gn particles never heard of them
  then they should just make a bunch of short ovas featuring nothing but katoki designs duking it out itd be more effective because thats whats selling
  how does it make you feeling knowing fukui is basically the new tomino the architect of modern day uc for the foreseeable future
  fukui wrote the original novel not the adaptation novel
  im fine with this but i feel like im one of the like maybe two people on /m/ who dont hate bannana
  that trailer opening
  yeah i was about to say even without reading the novel spoilers they probably just slapped psycoframe onto empty parts of the ms as some pack pic semi related
  it also comes with its own ntd system according to the novel spoilers
heres the ost if anyone wanted it  
its amazing how bad the animation quality is like how the fuck did they go from unicorn to this probably because they hired a korean and sunrise studio 1 is too busy to do more fukuiwank  that man is still eternally anal ravaged by gself beating up phenex
  its amazing how bad the animation quality is like how the fuck did they go from unicorn to this    what
  bad animation  where
  narrative was made by studio 1 though
when will the bd comes out anyway
  greco fans are really this desperate huh
  usually 36 months after release in theaters
so what happened to banagher
  saw someone on instagram say that he pilots the silver bullet probably not true
  i dont hate him either so that makes at least three of us      mineva muses that itll be their lifes work to keep it sealed away she says it to banagher links who wasnt there at the moment guided by the psycho waves of rita bernal and michelle luio he threw himself into the battle again to save jona bashta banagher after all was her soulmate
    just fyi the nt novel and light novel phoenix hunt are 2 entirely separate books the nt novel is an adaptation of the movie
  looks amazing
  production looks nice and slick but i feel myself checking out of the story already it very much seems like a unicorn sequel in that respect    hot topic looks like hell be fun to make fun of maybe
    im more inclined to think itd be riddhe
  mineva has him tied to her bed until he helps her produce a zabi heir
  hes right  the animation isnt bad per se but its nowhere near the quality of unicorn  none of the gundam ovas postunicorn have even touched it in terms of animation quality
  you know what if you told me they had a stash of earth artefacts that mquve had been hoarding a la the nazis and were slowly selling them off for extra funds id buy it and think it was super cool
  really unicorn had some superior shit animation to it at times
  why does the narrative have a monoeye in this shot
    do we see it hit
  i for some reason did not like the character designs so i checked who made themkorean    now it all meakes sense
  mustve got that from dozle
so i guess the phenex is destroyed in the final battle protecting the narrative gundam based on how zeonics translation of the novel summary went
amuro ray ghost will fuse with phenex and deliver ungodly wrath to zeon and yes they will have beyond the time newtype sex while the mc watch
  thats bullshit
  thank you anon
  so this cunt gets a happy ending but marida doesnt fuck this gay earth
so banagher is officially the kira yamato of uc
  has both of his childhood friends turned into newtype ghosts  happy ending
  no im talking about mineva
  huh are you talking about banagher i dont remember this
  so the phenex becomes a true newtype and disappears in the end like the unicorn almost once did
  because the animation is shit its ibo all over again
  the aussie guy if the novel spoilers are to be trusted
  i think she will be a newtype ghost in the machine
  as if i couldnt hate fukui and the unicorn novel ova whatever series more than i already do god im mad thanks for explaining it to me though  i mean its not necessarily an unreasonable response to manmade technology that somehow accidentally performs almost literal godlike magic that were never part of its specs or intended purpose
  unicorns animation wasnt that good especially the parts employing the exceedingly obvious cgi
  no unicorns animation is the best gundam has had since turn a  a close runner up is greco and thats it    most of the series we got over the last two decades are just using stills mecha that look like flash or only animate the explosions well
    yes and one of the best depictions in the series
  age had better mecha animation that greco and pretty easily at that so did gbf    unicorn was almost uniformly very good except for some cg integration issues and whatever the hell went wrong with the beginning of episode 5
transformer memes
so the only people that like this mess are heero/relena shippers right
  no they hate it too
be artdink  make successful psp uc gundam games  get charged to make a macross game  make a new game engine for the series  shit thats actually really good  get fired up and make a passionate love letter to the macross franchise for your next project  bamco gives you only one year since it coincides with the anniversary of macross  oh shit  push through and update the visuals rehaul the ui to best and most /m/ kind of ui ever  add new mechanics to the valkyries  add tons of pure fun in every section of the game and pace the game perfectly along with the best shop ever in a mecha game with the right amount of collectibles and even the limit breaker  add tons of new missions and difficulties  add better options for colouring the mechas  perfect tight controls with on point macross animations even if the melee slide looks ridiculous  add custom music and 70 fucking songs    10/10 would remember love again then     bamco gives you a year right off the bat to develop a new gundam game that is uc seed and oo  this time they are more lenient and happy enough to let bec help you  seems manageable    1 year later    absolutely shitty rehash of gundam battle universe  completely lobotomised melee and zero melee tracking  neutered melee attacks  absolute shit structure of missions  not even using the better faster and more responsive macross engine  absolute shitshow of colours and ui  not even the courtesy of custom soundtrack  not even being able to have fun with a limit breaker  physics are somehow wonkier than gundam battle universe  somehow the stages are worse and more polygonal than gbu and muf    what the fuck happened /m/ what made them not use the macross engine to make their perfect gundam game
i actually started playing this earlier this week i played the shit out of battle universe and wanted more its pretty embarrassing just how much of a rehash this one is
who the fuck knows but assault survive is a terrible grindfest    at least the macross games are still good with delta scramble
is triangle frontier a good macross game
  a year later  tasked with making a gundam battle game on the 3ds  challenge accepted game comes out  has a whopping 6 campaigns  trimmed down versions of the 0079 efsf zeon 0087 aeug titans londo bell and neo zeon campaigns from gbu  unicorn and sinanju are tossed in as a bonus functionally identical to the shit already in the game  no reason to play the game has less content than battle chronicle    another year later  comes time to make a new game on the vita this time  based solely off of seed  it actually ends up being good two allnew campaigns with three main routes for each and a lot of missions based on the various astrays and stargazer  for some reason this is the one to kill the series
  as long as you ignore school mode its got more content than ultimate frontier
  i remember playing bgu and always thinking ms were way too fast did anyone ese think the same
  boy good thing you didnt unlock the f91
  
  what the actual fuck
  it was just a really bad time for gundam vidya anon you had assault survive and then around the same time you had shin gihren which could have been an amazing game with its updated graphics and new game mechanics they even had an amazing anime intro showing all the possibilities with zeta zz and cca scenes     it then released and only had about 1/4th of the content from toa v and bamco tried to sell the cut content as dlc and when the dlc didnt sell they abandoned the game leaving us with a game that had a oyw scenario a few oyw side scenarios and one side of a cca campaign with some zz and unicorn characters added in for cameos    there hasnt been a gg game since then
  not gonna lie though if they gave us a new game with its systems and a full scenario for the oyw up to whatever and officer side scenarios id be hype as hell the amuro 0093 and the gyunei scenarios i particularly enjoyed
  i feel very fortunate that gundam vs still survives even if gvs ps4 was a cashin sidestep than an actual sequel
  might as well ask rather than make a new thread are there translations for any of the gg games i keep meaning to play gg v but im assuming you cant just blunt force your way through having to read moon like you do in action games
  whats ironic about battle destiny is that they seem pretty hype about it despite it being utterly meh just better than the shit that came out on the 3ds but the reason the franchise was killed may have been twofold     1gundam breaker was out and it just did what assault survive should have done in the first place  the ability to autistically customize your dream gundam    2because artdink got into the sword art online games and though that was the best time to finally perfect the queadluunrau type of flight system based on the macross games they made    and my conjucture  probably working on the sao games gave them an excuse to tackle less projects over the years as bamco overworked them between 2012 and 2015 with so many games they had to shit out      fuck i remember bamco also trying to scam us with that grand ultraman game that utterly killed ultra games where they tried to advertise it as an action game at first and then made it a subpar srw clone around the same time as shin gihren came out
  heres a wiki that has translations for threat of axis v  
  i loved how the char cca scenario had you start out in commander mode as a ragtag group of old haman neozeon remnants hiding in a shoal zone using old ships and suits left over from zz era under the command of char then work your way up slowing getting better ms and ships from anaheim electronics that allow you to start taking zones like sweet water colony and if you successfully drop axis you get an event that lets you become a real faction and start an invasion of earth and space
  nnani
  the f stands for frame skip
  iirc i think artdink changed the usual staff for gundam assault survive and thats why it was so bad triangle frontier was pretty shitty too when you put aside the glorified dating sim thing
so wait i played a fucking billion hours of battle tactics and have had the rest of the series on my backlog for years when do they get bad is it just as
  its literally just assault survive also you should really just go straight to gundam battle universe each game is just a straight build on of the last
  i dont think so it plays mostly the same as ultimate frontier except for changes in how packs work and missile locks
  tfw the f91 isnt even the best mobile suit in the game despite being able to rapidfire the vsbr
  you poor sad strange anon
  battle uc games get to right before victory  died  battle destiny was good and had room to improve with all the different astray series not added could have even tried battle 00 or battle wing if they went deep into side material  died  sd games finally add gunit  died  all the series i love died
  g gen overworld was also supposed to have gsaviour if that makes it sting more
  yeah chars scenario is quite possibly the best scenario in the game
  misquote 
  i hope you arent implying penelope is the best its trash compared to the xi gundam and the exsthe real best especially blows it right the fuck out
  xis special attack sucks ass because it doesnt fire beams and exs gets instafucked by funnel missiles
  special attacks are really easily dodged son and you arent gonna catch an exs with your meme missiles when it pumps up alice plus theres no ifield to protect it so exs can just dash rightlet momentum carry it and start firing those beam cannons and those fuckers hurt
  sd isnt really dead though it just took a long time due to the generational shift between overworld and genesis    also gunit was in f before overworld
  i wonder how they would have reworked the mechanics to make the late uc work in gbu the gameplay mechanics were already broken pretty badly since almost any fully upgraded unit from the zeta era and beyond you could just tap the thrust button and the suit would fly across the map in 1 to 2 seconds
  special attacks are really easily dodged son  ill take beam and missile spam over xis missile spam anyday  and you arent gonna catch an exs with your meme missiles when it pumps up alice plus theres no ifield to protect it so exs can just dash rightlet momentum carry it and start firing those beam cannons and those fuckers hurt  send funnel missiles to fly toward it hold square to send them all on a collision course fire off spa as soon as they get hit just wait out alice and whoops the exs is helpless    best unit in the game period is pic related though literally nothing can stand up to it
  f was over a decade before overworld gunit had been missing that long sd has been mostly mobile these days
  send funnel missiles to fly toward it  see webm although this is completely for glam funnels in gbu are not very fast so they can be avoided  and  waiting out alice  trust me m8 even if you didyoud stiill die the exs has some very intense firepower and that psycho gundam is just decent target practice for it
  oh anon
sounds like they were overworked to me
  thats just the ai being ai the exs can run circles around the psycho and that works out pretty badly in an open environment
  actually melee is just plain broken in this game and the psyco mkii is one of the best when it comes to melee id probably put the o second god i love this thing    but i thought about it some more did some further testing and you might be right after all it might just be the hyper boss battle version but the exs has a ridiculous ifield and hits like a bastard i guess i just forgot how crazy they made it im sorry anon  i still think the penelope is better for fighting the ai though omnidirectional attacks that cant be intercepted are good
  anyone have footage of a player hinu using its fin funnel ultimate on the boss version of the f91 each time i spammed that the ai would just counter by going super mode and moving around the place the resulting laser light show from the funnels trying to hit the f91 is fucking glorious
  webm had issues converting heres some the o bullshit      i did one with the dff instead of the hinu i hope thats okay
  
  now you know how iron mask felt
    fuck yes much appreciated anon
  f91  jesus fucking christ
    just like my japanese animes
          here anons two qubeleys simultaneously doing funnel spam against an f91 using mepe we managed to hit it once
  how bullshit would v2 be
  its in assault survive its a pretty crazily high performance suit comes with a flight capability and the v2ab has an ifield too
does gbu have an english patch like as does
  no but it doesnt really need one the objective for almost every single mission is defeat all enemies all the mobile suit names are in plain english
  dude i fucking forgot to post the rest of these
            holy fuck these are so low quality
  please dont be mean to artdink they did their best
   some reason this is the one to kill the series  because vita was doa and i made the mistake of buying it it was a great game though probably my favorite of their games
  after  images   with  mass
  ooh i really enjoyed as for all its flaws
hinestly the most surprising thing aboiut this thread is that enough people on /m/ played the artdink gundam and macross games to criticize them   sorry for misspellings im drunk
  theyre essential hacked pspcore
  this i downloaded gbu long before i even bothered to watch an episode of gundam
  they were pretty popular games and usually get recognized as one of the psps must plays so i dont think so
        now im starting to feel like a hipster for having never played the artdink games but putting 200 hours in gvg next plus
  gvgnp was/is pretty popular to its probably my favorite gundam vs game actually something about the exvs games always felt a bit off to me
bec  help
i only played assault survive and enjoyed it how much better is battle universe
even with all its problems i still got a lot of enjoyment out of assault survive and wish there were still gundam games like this being made where you can just indulge in stat building and fucking with established show events in an action game  the psp battle games were not the best gundam action games but they were such satisfying kusoge to spend time onthe macross ones were great at that as well and even played better
i honestly havent played any gundam games other than the ps1 battle assault games    i dont have my psp handy but would it be worth emulating the psp games or any of the ps2 games
  gundam battle universe is absolutely worth playing
  much better because there isnt anything as fucking stupid and overpowered as beam boomerangs which break the everliving shit out of the game and make it trivial as fuck    also i think gbu handled a lot of scenarios much better too since they cram too much shit into one mission and as a result quite a few cinematic moments lack impact    you dont have to grind points either to unlock shit as well you just play the game and it all comes to you
  that webm  is the whole game like that its like night and day the gbu webms itt legitimately look like theyre from some anime
  time to get serious
  you know they were aiming for vs audience when you play the game
  thank you anon youre a star
  it can get like gbu too its just easy to cheese the game with that because its fucking busted and it pissed me off when i played through gas so much to this day that i still remember you can do that    and to its credit it did sort of make me appcreciate kyrios since i thought it was the only 00 unit that was somewhat interesting to play the others are justeh
  gundam vs zeta gundam is great too if only for the batshit ways you can change the timeline in uc campaign mode you want garma to steal the mk ii it can happen but be ready for titans kamille if you do  i still want to see the worst timeline where lalah and sayla both die at solomon but its such a bitch to do
  this not to mention it was mostly made out of obligation because bandai wanted to ake advantage of those spiffy new frontier movies so they basically almostrecycled everything except made it worse since it was a cashgrab but the change in staff would somewhat explain why they did what they did makes me wonder if the old stuff now worked on battle robot damashii or worsethe madoka game      bec was one of the inner bandai namco studios after gas was finished in 2010 bandai decided to have it merge with banpresto to produce beter games and the new studio is the one known as bb studio you might know them from the srw z series the gundam memories game on the psp which is banpresto trying to make an ace game on their own while the bec members try to recreate their own gundam oo game from the ps2 in under 7 months times or something and then gundam side stories on the ps3    off topic but im still pissed to this day as to how gundam memories was handled because that game had enormous potential and bandai pissed on it before and after its release not to mention if they had more time and could add some ground combat as well im sure it would be a fun arcadey experience
  well yeah kyrios didnt suck shit like the others  be exia  melee suit that isnt that great in melee  be dynames  pointless sniping suit  be virtue  gn bazooka fires continuous beams making it significantly worse than say the zzs high mega cannon
  yes absolutely
  virtue is just broken i agree with exia and dynames being underwhelming though gn flag is surprisingly fun for an a rank unit
  i know what bec is i dont know why anyone thinks they would ever improve the quality of anything thats literally the most reliable red flag that something is going to be cheap cash in garbage there is
  they became good codemonkeys for banpresto and upped the manpower so theres that
  i remember virtue being good for wingmen just distract the enemy and a giant beam will come out of nowhere and take a chunk of their health from across the map
  actually all long range suits with huge fucking beam is just broken when the beam hits it will stunlock the enemy until it recharges
  its one of the better ones but macross ultimate frontier is better imo since customs get fucked over due to how school mode is mandatory for them and their stats dont get raised naturally
  newtypes btfo
  download google translate on your phone and use the camera function to scan moonrunes into english should only have to do that if you encounter politics/main event decisions such as letting white base be resupplied by matilda saying no will cause white base to be destroyed
i love metal gears/kojimas /m/ designs and style what are some other /m/ content with similar aesthetics
  zone of the enders by the same artist also some kotobukiya kits
just check out everything yoji shinkawa has ever done  
    why is zoe so based
  bless yoji shinkawa
  the metal gear mechs are so cool its too bad that mgs is kinda overrated and turns people on /m/ away from the mechs because /vg/ shit
  the mechanical designer did a godzilla eva unit 
friend
this is coming out in about a month  still no sign of the og series on bluray or even dvd    what is this manga anyway
  what is this manga anyway  a manga version of the original series made by matsumoto done exactly at the same time as the series was being made       
  its also a incomplete huge pile of shit as it should be expected from lazy
  still gonna buy the hardback
  that cover design  they could have put either the text or image horizontally what a nonsensical layout all theyre doing is covering most of the image where the detail is
  it works a lot better with the character faces motif theyve been doing for their other classic releases
  i wonder how well 2199 did for funimation it feels like it got kind of screwed by the original expensive sub only bd releases from reaching a bigger audience
  yeah 2202 was just a mess i only came across it after looking for the bd releases of 2199
  its probably the same as whatever jp edition this is based off they could have used a smaller font though
  what do you mean incomplete
  manga ends at the beginning of yamato 2 story
sjw seas  no fucking thank you id rather read duwangtier scanlations from the early 2000s
  more like seven sjws
blade kiiiiiiliillck
  blade kick  performs normal kick  blade positioned in a way it wouldnt even harm the attacked
previous thread     links for beginners  ddl        list of subbed series        super hero time osts       super sentai monster designs  gorenger  zyuohger      monster and robot sentai design art books      do not make new generals when it immediately reaches bump limit wait till it gets to page 6 to make a new general mod rules
  what kind of weirdo drew that
  why would anyone hug with niggers who steal your toys
  note that kyoryuger wasnt just a success because it was dinosaurs and toys it was also massively kidfriendly
best team
  everyone is the best girl in that lineup except kairi
  cant have all of them there huh poor pat2 pat3
  amy sure has kidfriendly thighs
  why are there 2 6th rangers wasnt this series supposed to be about 2 sentai team
  if only they knew
mochizuki who did kyuranger is producing a new show called detective zero starting in january so hes probably not doing ryusouger
  that is two teams youre seeing
pairing lvp with a sentai who can barely managed to give proper screentime to each characters    idk if toei trying to outdo themselves or were living in the worst timeline
  using pat u to save space  lupinx using pat armor    kek
i wonder if ryusouger bombs and the rumors are right and its a last attempt to keep sentai relevant im actually super curious what hasbro would do obviously they still have a few seasons to work with but after those would they start making new original seasons    and if they did would toei try to pull a saban and repurpose the new american show footage to make a quick buck with under the super sentai moniker would change it from super sentai to some other descriptor to keep the familiarity but having them as distinct entities    more importantly would the japanese toys of the adaptation still be better than the american ones
  so just leave it to hasbro and just let toei dub the show back to japanese
  given hasbro only rates pr as an emerging brand instead of a fullon franchise brand they may well let it die off if theres no sentai any more why risk that massive extra investment if its not guaranteed to return on them eh
  i feel ryusougers success will come down to it having collectible toys or not have the same kind of shit that makes kids wanna buy kamen rider toys
  if they dont go with a collectible gimmick similar to the ranger keys and beast batteries ill eat my hat
  the revival of masked rider after the death of power ranger
reminder that tv ratings for kids shows are never going to be what they once were because kids arent the ones still watching television
  who does that leave
  either omori tsukada or someone new given lupats performance i cant see utsunomiya going a second year in a row not that sentais had a producer go for multiple years in a row since the rotation started in 2008
  id be fine with either omori or tsukada they both have good shit under their belts
  im kinda hoping for omori even if his opinion that yellow is a feminine color was retarded
  considering mochizukis doing that drama now its almost certainly got to be tsukada then unless its a newbie which no one can really predict until it happens     supposedly omori said he was going to take a break after build which makes sense considering he did two rider shows in a row he couldve changed his mind but if we take him at his word tsukada is the only option we know of and it is conspicuous given that he recently left the medical drama he was working on just last year the show that hed been on since after he did fourze
  with tsukada behind it ryusouger would hopefully be at the least pretty entertaining
  isnt tsukada producing kaiju ward gallas though
  he is but thats just a miniseries right if its not him then its got to be a newbie then
  i dont think theres been anything on how long the series is supposed to be but its been slated for a spring 2019 release so he may not have time or simply may not want his attention taken away from an original project
i just hope my wife is doing fine
what is your favorite showa sentai gorenger to liveman
  flashman
  changeman personally although that period from dynaman to liveman was some top tier sentai in general
  liveman because of their villains and yellow lion
  you the one with a huge crush on his actor
shout marathon returns
  link
  
  kakuranger    i sometimes forget how batshit it was
  changeman
  pat u with siren striker armor never
do you think noel having the siren striker was demanded by the toy company or desired by the writers
  the lupins getting splash and siren was 100 a bandai demand maybe it could have been avoided if the teams had actually been fighting and swapping vehicles so kids already wanted to collect them all but its pretty clear as it stood that there was a sales gap between the pats and lupins that made bandai think they could salvage some of the numbers if they made everything lupinsonly going forward
  maybe its just me but the toys seem kinda lame in general theres a collectible gimmick going on but there is barely any unity and they dont look cool in the show much of the time
  i brought this up in the last thread but the biggest problem with lupats toyline is that the basic armswapping gimmick is all there is good cool kaiser vsx is the only upgrade in the entire show thats anything but an arm swap or head swap on the same core body even if you collect all the vs vehicles and i have in minipla form you cant use the vast majority of them together you can put three vehicles on goodie two more on the magnum and then the other nine are just sitting there doing nothing this is an absurd number of spare parts way more than even gaoranger which had four more animals than you could actually use at once if victory and siren were actually strikers that could combine with the other three auxiliary vehicles of their respective types then you would have a lot more play value
  power rangers is on a 2 year plan per series  busters 2  toq 2  zyuoh  2  kyu  2  lvp  2  ryu  2  thats 12 years of shows sentai would probably be back by then
  implying theyd ever adapt toq  its too weird for americans
  people felt the same way about goon
      they really should have make goody the super upgraded form attachment instead of the main component for the mecha its too restricting with 2 teams who are not in good term with one another
  and they stripped out all the weirder aspects of the show talking sentient cars pollution based monsters it would be hard to do that if the entire show including the ranger designs are the weirder aspects
  toqger is nowhere near as weird as goonger and has less quirky footage it actually has really cool team attacks
  the worst thing in all of this is that theyre probably going to continue to make the same mistake next year
  i dont think they will this mistake to this degree is uniquely lupat theres been other seasons where you had leftover parts like ninnin and kyu have some but its like three or four leftover parts in what is otherwise a large array of complete robots the worst offender before this was toq rainbow which didnt use at least 5060 of the mass of the trains but it did use parts from all the trains and if you stuck to cho cho toq daioh and hyper teioh you would only have police fire and shield left over lupat is the only season to have so few complete robots and so many spare parts and i would be surprised if they did it again
  im talking about the designs themselves both the mechs and suits they dont seem all that marketable to the west
  well if the lupins are popular with the people then there really is no helping it because this season ultimately is based on the phamtom thief genre and that genre relies on the police never catching or figuring out the identity of the phantom thieves so nips by and large are already aware of what will happen before it happens but the writers are still pretending that they havent figured it out yet
  they can cut the dickzord scene and nothing of value will be lost plus nothing stops them from copying sentai and making the team kids turned older well other than the extremely narrow pool of kiwi children who can say their lines and not sound like theyre reciting a mothers day poem in a school act
  hasbro could easily adapt and balance the thief vs cop shit by throwing the american pats in a different cockpit where the lupins should be originally
  neither were the goon mechs just keep the fights short like rpm
  its gotta be omori build and exaid were both hits for toei and although their give sentai to a rider producer thing didnt work with gobusters or ninninger hes had a lot more experience crafting successful shows for toei    though he did do three shows in for years he might be burnt out
  mfw seeing the kunoichi missile in action for the first time  this show is fun as fuck and im loving it any other sentai or tokusatsu that are like this in terms of tone showa or heisei it doesnt matter
  if you want another something silly you should watch carranger
  im not convinced capable of forming new bots is why the other sentai toys sold better
  if it was popular then sales wouldnt be this abysmal
  ryusouger sounds executive mandated with dino  we all know how those shows turn out
  bad play factor is known to have impacted the sales of sentai toys in the past such as with gosei ultimate being a standalone brick that didnt have useful interactions with any of the existing toyline if the kids arent playing with most of the lupat toys theyve already got because they cant play with them all at once what motivation do parents have to get them more
  well just have to see my dear anonkun
im honestly shocked the lupat toys are not a hit theyre vehicles boys love vehicles and theyre both transformation trinkets for the changers and parts for the toy mecha too
  sentai toys are too rigid in their transformations and combinations kids want to be creative and create their own combinations they want to go beyond what is shown on the tv show but sentai designs needlessly limit your combination possibilities lupat toys are the worse you can swap arms and choose between 4 possible heads but thats it if the entire line had been designed more like magic and splash each vehicle having its own head and chest piece i think the line wouldve been more popular bandai needs to embrace a new design aesthetic in sentai design or use a more creative approach like their mugenbine toy line
from a production standpoint i honestly think creating two teams in lupat is a waste of time    why bother making two teams when its only one youll pander to anyway what a waste of resources
  i doubt the intention was to focus more on one than the other but if the toybuying or toydemandingfromparents i guess audience respond better to one than the other and sales arent stellar these days in general you reevaluate your priorities sharpish
  that was really expected in a versus title though
  wait i got it    the kids like capes
  not necessarily if it sold well but the way things were it was unfortunately unavoidable in hindsight this is bandai just making poor toyline decisions and backpedaling when it inevitably blew up
  thats not the only way theyre too rigid they have very little articulation as well sentai mechs are pretty much bricks
i love lupat but ill admit this season is literally one big pile of wasted potential theres so much stuff you can with having two different teams at once   its also a shame that we might never get something like this ever again
  i dont expect that to change too much being a brick is what makes sentai robots sentai robots but where they once stood alone they now have new competition with korean kids shows like tobot dinocore and biklonz who offer greater articulation and better design bandai doesnt have to look any further than the tip of its nose to place the blame on sagging toy sales
      not necessarily postjetman toys are pretty articulate its just that something happened around roughly during the boukenger toys    one thing thats really amiss nowadays are the amount of folding and transforming you get with the toys the closest modern one you have is go busters
  its not like the toys couldnt have better articulation because every year bandai puts out minipla versions of the exact same designs with all the same transformations and combinations that have all the joints the dx toys are missing
  the minipla versions of the mechs are better then the dx models imo they have more emotion ill say plus the articulation to make more dynamic poses
  its the fucking gimmicks/collectibles   electronics  brick level 1  collectible gimmick  brick level 2  collectible gimmick that interacts with roleplay item  brick level 3    shurikenjin only got to avoid the bricking by slapping the gimmick on its head
  shurikenjin only got to avoid the bricking by slapping the gimmick on its head  and then they did it away by slapping it on the chest and on the head twice
  post jetman dx robot toys had just as little articulation as todays maybe even less liverobo had an elbow bend and that was about it the rest had a shoulder joint and that was it
  they had much more intuitive transformations though you barely fold or ext
    lack of articulation would be fine if the toys had some sense of power and presence   daizyujin dairenoh muteki shogun put the aesthetic and power of the combined form first most sentai mechas these days end up looking slapped together and having too many colors and then the substitutions and combinations make them look even worse
g12 is still unironically my favourite combination
im 27 episodes into kyuranger and really enjoying it why do people call it bad
  youre about 6 episodes from finding out
dogranio pouring a glass out for destra  damn i didnt think that would get me  for a head boss character who literally does nothing that was actially pretty good
  so episode 33 something big is happening
  a lot of people didnt like cast members and the red is one of the most annoying weve ever had
  he seems fine by me reminds me of gosei red
  a wild west train sentai would be rad
  a lot of people around here became extremely sensitive about energetic reds after daigo and then even more so after takaharu luckys not one of my favorite reds ever but hes fine
  because its around kyoryuger levels with a bit less success garu triggers people here
  the red is basically takaharu but even more annoying has a fantastic finale bit though they give next to no time to hammy sparda and raptor garu is basically relegated to telling lucky what an amazing guy he is and how amazing he is and that everyone should realize how amazing he is they spend so much time developing stinger when hes incredibly boring and his actor makes him boring as well and the last third or so feels very rushed in terms of trying to solve all the floating plot points    its not a show i would ever watch again naga balance kotaro champ tsurugi and shao were the parts that kept me interested and enjoying it whereas everything else wasnt
  its not exactly like that theres not one big fuck up at that point its just when all the little things start to go really wrong the interesting character storylines are done and dusted most of the cast are sidelined for good it brings in some fucking terrible resolutions to the prof anton and luckys dad storylines the final act is a clusterfuck of dumb ideas and theres some really crap standalone episodes peppered throughout to make it even worse what good faith it builds up between eps 10 and 30 is pissed away
  even more annoying than takaharu  stopped reading right there at least the others on the kyuranger team existed takaharu and friends was all ninninger turned out to be for near 3/4 of the series except for party night
  at least the others on the kyuranger team existed  after the kakuranger teamup they basically shoved takaharu into a corner constantly calling him an idiot and they worked with his actor to work it out he wasnt shouting his catchphrase as much and eventually barely at all and he found a decent middleground where he could at least act somewhat heroic without being completely grating dont forget yakumo and kasumi got so many more focus episodes out of nowhere im not saying takaharu was good at all    lucky is yossha lucky all the time his plot points all basically revolve around being lucky to the point that the final battle even has him riding down on a meteor mirroring the first episode hes the only one who seems to ever get the big speeches and then you have garu and even hammy saying how amazing he is and his luck is hammy even has her learning a lesson from him instead of overcoming things in her first focus episode they toned it down around the time tsurugi appeared and he wasnt shouting it at much but his character itself was just grating in general i have nothing against the actor or anything but it just wasnt fun to see lucky on screen at any point but the final battle and the first episodes fight when no one knew any better    at least lucky shared the moon/sun upgrade and i thank him for it because the time he did were fun with the characters even with him
  lucky doesnt even begin to compare to takaharu in terms of being annoying takaharu is so annoying that even the show had to acknowledge it
  at least they had the balls to acknowledge it the only time someone seriously shat on lucky with the kyurangers was the pegasus episode where hammy gets told to fuck off cause wtf lucky works so hard1
  thats because goonger mecha are aesthetically pleasing when they arent and they clusterfuck then its just a piled turd    engine oh is one of my favorite mecha i wish there was an episode where it was alternate reality where the engines were just cars no eyes and what not regardless that was a damn fine design so was gunbaroh and carrygator is one of my favorite engines
  i could not stand yossha lucky and it was painful every time he had to shout it takaharu was an idiot and the moette kitaa nonsense was pretty much immediately put a stop to and he basically became a side character outside of when he got his upgrade and the fight against his rival in the early episodes because the directors saw he could not pull off the catchphrase and the actor was being grating so they reworked things    lucky constantly has focus lucky constantly shouts his catchphrase sometimes multiple times an episode his biggest worry is simply that hes not lucky hes the one who constantly solves disputes or figures out an answer to something and its simply frustrating to see this happen over and over and over again once tsurugi comes into play yes hes a bit more reserved in shouting his catchphrase and you have more focus on other characters because the episodes are about them but lucky still finds a way to weasel into everything    tsurugi has a problem with repeating his catchphrase as well i doubt anyone would disagree with that but at least hes not as grating he loses he has tons of failures he tries to work the catchphrase into regular discussions and his act of being the best constantly falls apart at the seams and hes tested lucky just seems to be great at everything barring his dad because of his luck
  tsurugi has a problem with repeating his legendary catchphrase as well  nante kotto what an opinion
  it was too legendary for my mere ears at times
  this is very true and confuses me because nips dont give a shit about the individual mecha given the recent designs these past few years the toys and designs need more transformations  the mecha are not imposing anymore when a toddler brick of simplicity is an arm and doesnt require anything to do so other putting it on a port i like the lupin vs vehicles but theyre dinky like a sd version of what they should be but most of the mecha for the past few years look sd or chibi when they have simple transformation and the components are so shrunk i think the last time we had vehicles that werent shrunk was bouken then maybe go go v
  dont focus on captain kirk
this episode was pure kino  btw how many chapters will this season have
  people seem to ignore that kasumi was the real sue of ninninger i didnt find takaharu overwhelming at all
  they spend so much time developing stinger when hes incredibly boring and his actor makes him boring as well  episode of stinger was pretty good but even then stinger is just chemistry bait for champ
  its surely made me appreciate the lupin and pats simpler less silly catchphrases  also the yakumo focus episodes were my favorite episodes from that whole series tbqh
  so was kirk the red ranger or the gold ranger or what
   they worked with his actor to work it out  what was wrong with his actor
  bad at acting  although im pretty sure the person youre replying to is just pulling this out of their ass
  family package
  captain kirk was always a package deal with spock the logic and mccoy the conscience  an episode that was all kirk would be shit
  i mean the fact that he was bad with acting so they worked around that by giving others much more screentime unless the way the show ended up was always planned to unfold how it did with the side characters getting more screentime than him theres a very noticeable change with how they handle takaharu after the kakuranger/hurricanger stuff and raizou and eventually he does get better at acting somewhat
  its not a show i would ever watch again  do people typically watch super sentai shows multiple times its 50 freaking episodes
  we had people here rewatching things like shinkenger and megaranger on top of others going back to revisit gokaiger after having seen more series so yeah /krg/ has people who rewatch stuff like deno kabuto kuuga and ooo so i know it does happen my point was that if you told me i had to sit and watch it again i just would refuse you outright stuff like goon gekiranger dairanger abaranger kakuranger sun vulcan megaranger toq gobus and so on are all series i would gladly rewatch some time down the road as an example
  i really couldnt imagine rewatching an entire toku season but ill go back to rewatch select episodes i liked though maybe ive got kind of a inclination to go rewatch some timeranger episodes fucking loved that season so much
  this    beef snake was the best
people think lucky is worse than takaharu  thats not a very funny joke
  well there are years with shitty sentai shows so its not strange to rewatch old shows on those occasions
  does it really matter theyre both terrible
i think i figure out what going on from scan and this episode    to retrieve lupin collection and protect noel from ganglers  kogure search people who have potential to be a kaitou  and then hire zamigo frozen their loved one to force them become a kaitou  he probably keep their loved one inside the book or imprison somewhere else and will give them back to kaitou after retrieve all collection
  at least takas team gave him shit all the time instead of sucking his dick
  i for sure think that takaharu was a worse red but both of them had annoying catchphrases they wouldnt stop saying
christmas episode is so fucking lame im not even a muzzie
  if they even bother with it
was on this thread   and someone posted amuro didnt die his overwhelming power sent him into another dimension where he will battle char for eternity alongside the minovsky emperor  and i replied with   surprised their arent a shit ton of fanfics where amuro and char end up in other franchises like what happened with halo 3s ending there were some good fics during those years    what if that actually happened where char and amuro are sent to different franchises and have to help them out to return home
  thats a small sazabi
  no one gives a shit about uc in the west especially compared to halos peak popularity with 3
  no small thanks to banrises poor international business strategies is there a japanese fanfiction site like ffn
japanese fanfiction  isnt that what doujins are for
  and srw
  yeah but i mean a site for jffn just to see what cringe and antinaruhina fics there are by the sakufags
  so like gundam x quantum leap
  not small enough
discotek announced that that they have the license for tetsujin 28gou 1980 and will be releasing it on bd on january 29th 2019  im actually surprised theyre releasing it next month its coming out before several of the other series in their last bulk announcement as well as projects theyve been working on for awhile like the us release of the 2000s cyborg 009 series
  epic win thank you discotek
  based discotek does it again
still desperately seeking 009 but this is great news thank you discotek
  utterly based can discotek do no wrong
actually got into my first autistic internet argument over this and fx good times
nice
  the materials they received were in prettt bad condition no
    well they managed to botch the release of area 88 its an incomplete package missing key features such as the dub for the second half of the ova
  and they bowlderised teyandee
between discotek and seven seas tons of classic or forgotten anime and manga are getting official western releases  what the fuck is going on
  correct the master tapes for 009 were incomplete and heavily water damaged they were apparently found unceremoniously stuffed in a trash bag and thrown in a random closet its a miracle anyone even found them at all
  armored hunter mellowlink will never get released in the west because its literally been destroyed
    why is media preservation so hard bros
  something similar happened to layzners tapes right
i fixed the error on the cover
  copyright laws    wait what
  why were people calling it wrong tetsujin again
  wait what    there will never be a remastered or hd release of mellowlink because the original masters were destroyed in an earthquakeor was it flooding so the best you can get is the laserdiscs
    yes i am aware there was a dvd in japan sometime in the early 2000s but that was just an upscaled copy of a laserdisc version
  not muh
  well theres still sweet fuck all about the tokusatsu stuff they licensed despite near enough everything else announced at/after otakon having release dates
  because they went with this tetsujin in srw instead of imagawas tetsujin
  what tokusatsu licences what shows do they got
  not an /m/ show but i think something similar also happened to city hunter
  juspion and message from space galactic wars
  nah they were in good condition which is how layzner got a pretty good looking remastered bd release    or the original tetsujin    they also still need to do an xbomber release with subs and japanese audio
  theyre also doing the imagawa tetsujin movie
  they also still need to do an xbomber release with subs and japanese audio    after over two years it might be safe to say thats just not in the cards anymore
  well they could either just release their shit on dvd or not region lock their bds    either way its a fucking pain in the ass
  i dont think they could just remove the region locks on their dvds and bds and have the japanese companies theyre licensing the shows from just be okay with that not with all the paranoia about reverse importation
  or not region lock their bds  arent bd players that are region free pretty common whats even the point in it then i assume im missing at least something
  their dvds were encoded for regions 14 the last time i checked      they are but nobody sells them here domestically and the region a player i imported was a piece of junk and stopped working properly less than a year after buying it and i couldnt afford to send it back i do have a bdrom drive but i dont want to watch them on my pc
  kek
  not with all the paranoia about reverse importation  that makes no sense tho since both japan and usa are region a
  they can be pretty pricey especially if you need to import one i think that may be why region coding hasnt been killed off entirely by now    and generally speaking the purpose of region coding is so that the rightsholder can make the maximum profit off of licensing a property to different regions      it must be a recent thing that theyve been doing then because the lupin releases ive got from them are region 1 only
  fuck youre right i have no idea why they do that shit then    maybe to keep the euros in their place
  it must be a recent thing that theyve been doing then because the lupin releases ive got from them are region 1 only  how recent are those because i just checked my great mazinger discs and theyre coded for regions 16      and generally speaking the purpose of region coding is so that the rightsholder can make the maximum profit off of licensing a property to different regions  and thats fucking lame and gay if you live somewhere with zero public interest in the franchise of your preference so nobodys ever gonna license it anyway
  the lupin releases ive got are the first series mystery of mamo and fuma conspiracy roughly from the 20072014 time frame apparently the first of their second series box sets is also region 1    and yeah pretty much everything about region codes is lame gay and anticonsumer
  also speaking of fuma conspiracy    holy fucking shit im glad i got it before it went oop
    good lord
  well its no like they never make mistakes the fotns movie bluray is almost perfect if it wasnt for the fact that on the theathrical and home video endings they actually fucked up by switching to badly compressed and upscaled dvd footage like wtf didnt they got the hd footage from the master used for the theatrical ending and the trailers footages
  what really i never heard of an anime that actually doesnt exists anymore in film form outside of fucking shojo tsubaki and that one had a reason
  copyright dick waving egos revisionists and just plain lazyness
  yeah theyre pretty much at the mercy of the japanese licensor thats why they made such a big deal on twitter about their robot carnival bd being region free since thats a rare luxury
  ngfuckinge had the master lost for one episode even i think it was 16 shit happens
  you know ive heard this a lot but i have never once seen a source trust me i already looked on nip internet
  jap licensors have other ways around reverse importation paranoia for bds   usually its just forcing the western release to be x amount of months after the japanese one and forcing subtitles when japanese audio is selected but sometimes they can get a bit more scummy like when they forced the original bds for persona 4 to be dub only or when funimation was giving crappy masters for re zero and if youre aniplex you just charge japanese prices to begin with and refuse to renew any outstanding license agreements
  given crappy masters
  i still wonder what sorcery they pulled to be the first to put legend of the gold of babylon on bd in any country
  the subs for that are the same ones tatsunoko gave to streaming services i think they tried to cover up their own history of feline aids there
  blame that shitposting khaffir with a bag for a head      adv i think tried to start a classic anime label back in the day and the layzner tapes they got for some reason were all tinted blue or thats the hearsay i heard anyway ended up putting the kibosh on the whole line along with their second planned release which was going to be giant gorg
  does japan honestly give a shit about legend of gold babylon apart from seijun suzuki fans it seems to be part of that thing where people actively try to forget pink jacket lupin exists
  newer generations grow up just streaming their anime so physical releases are increasingly becoming the preserve of hardcore collectors who are more likely to buy classic shit so long as you do a limited production run thats guaranteed to sell out you can make a slim profit that seems to be discoteks methodology also helps that a lot of this stuff being licensed have been recently getting high profile remakes thats definitely the case with the manga that seven seas have been translating kids didnt give a shit about devilman before crybaby now we have the whole thing in english
  honestly i dont think anyone really gives a shit about babylon except for hardcore lupin fans
  nips and the americas are on the same blu ray regions any way unless theyre really worried about sells lose in europe/straya or china it doesnt seem like it should be a big deal
  unless theyre really worried about sells lose in europe/straya  italy does actually get a fair few bd releases at least  or china   arent they a big market
  dvd for comparison when region locked mattered for japs and the us
  the deal is though a jap region locked blu ray wouldnt work in either of those places anyway they licensing company would be undermining companies the japs licensed to instead of the japs themselves they really shouldnt care
  alongside the other reasons that have been stated i imagine the rights for a lot of these old shows are pretty cheap
  i am curious on how do they even determine which country goes in which region especially as some region has combination of both pal and ntsc
    no do getter go while youre going
  tetsujin 28  a based series from before nagais cancer ruined mecha
  but the anime version of getter robo go is terrible
  no it isnt i bet you havent even watched it
  sweet that show was based
  it mostly makes a sort of weird sense  all of europe being together works because of how much cultural exchange theres always been that extends into popculture throwing aussies in with them works because they share a lot of media with britain africas not exactly known for its entertainment industry and french is still lingua franca there for now so including them kind of works  us and canada together for obvious reasons weird that south america would be chucked in there given its spanish history but i suppose keeping all of the americas in one works in its own way having japan korea and the pacific islands there is a bit weirder  and then the 3rd world is region 3 simples
  is this even related to toei getter or is it a one shot original creation
    completely unrelated but how do i get into lupin it has been on my radar for quite a while but i have been holding back cause their material is quite massive is the manga and anime related whatsoever
    theres really no best way to start lupin but i recommend starting with the first television series its the first lupin iii tv series and its pretty damn good to boot one of the best tv anime of the 70s imo    the manga and anime obviously have the characters and concept in common and there are a couple of episodes adapted from manga chapters but that being said a lot of the lupin tv shows and movies are just directors and writers doing whatever they want rather than a 11 adaptation    so basically there is no substitute for reading the manga and no substitute for watching the anime which i think is pretty cool
  theres no continuity between it and 70s getter
  watch the first two tv shows then watch mystery of mamo and castle of cagliostro after that take your pick of the films and ovas that sound interesting id recommend fuma conspiracy bye bye liberty crisis episode 0 and the two takashi koike movies jigens gravestone and bloodsplatter of goemon ishikawa manga you can read whatevers published in english
    i actually thought the first couple of episodes are rather weak but still early in the show you get the great prison escape one
  manga you can read whatevers published in english    who do i have to kill for it to be republished in hardback with the color pages intact
  id say tokyopop but theyre deader than dead then id say wait for the next high profile new series or remake but weve had two lupin tv shows in the last few years and no interest there so never    were possibly going to get a koike remake of mystery of mamo in the next few years though so thats going to be cool
  honestly with lupin you could start almost anywhere its all very standalone and you rarely need any sort of background beyond a basic whos who of the characters   for my money id say watch the original tv series first then move on to mystery of mamo and castle of cagliostro not only is all of it pretty high quality stuff but youll get all good grasp on the wide range lupins tone can take  from there its just whatever youre in the mood for part 2 was a cult hit on adult swim and was the introduction to lupin for a lot of people myself included and is great for episodic wacky thief adventures if you want something darker akin to early part 1 you can watch the koike stuff if you want a more serialized story you can watch part 4 or you can check out any of the countless tv specials that have been released over the years
  shotaro looks too human to be a nagano character design
  get over it it was the right tetsujin to use for srw
    more of a power armor than a rc robot
  same thing with shining heresy but it was a fire
    
    sources
its uc 080 and you have been voted into power what would you do /m/
  probably authorize the titans out of fear that zeon and its sympathizers might try to drop a colony on my earthnoid constituents    you expect me to solve the space troubles
  1 dont keep my earth fleet in one place gato  2 try to set up a mass production of gundams   3 build a better relationship with the sids and the moon
declare myself the god emperor of mankind declare zeon  jupiter heretics and go full deus vult on everyone
i create a stable  sensible platform for job/economic growth lower taxes cutspending and introduce medical reform
  ask has anyone thought of peace treaties between zeeks and feddies and not fucking it up or the earth than it already is no one ok lets start with that
  commission gryps to be built then use it to kill every last space colony then commission mobile doll drones be made to cleanse the earth of the poor coloreds women children and nonchristians    then i will shoot myself in the head having done gods work and go to heaven to receive ideon to cleanse every other gundam timeline in fire
build a wall around side 3 make zeon pay for it
  also  keeping a big eye on anaheim electronics and who they sell mobiles suits to
  jamitov would just have you assassinared like he did to blex
  mds  in a minovsky particle battlefield
    s p a c e w a l l
surrender control of the federation government to char aznable
set up the antizeonuniongroup arug with mostly spacenoids good luck zeon
  char stop posting
  i see so negotiations means fuck all in gundam makes sense i guess well fuck it i guess nuking zeek territories would have saved anyone the trouble or limit that electronics company that sells ms to damn near anybody
gas every last one of the spcenoids
  set up garrisons with gms and mp guncannons
be a frontline leader authorize interesting ms try to bring about peace and unity between earth and space also i guess id try to kill some of the more dangerous elements using my knowledge of events before they got to me jamitov and yazan would be on the short list
dont make the same mistakes as they did after the war find a way to shutdown anaheim and then when everything seems fine i replace the high command with the titans and give total control to them afterwards i fuck right off and retire in mars
wipe out every colony and restart the universal century spacenoids are too retarded to fix and too violent to ignore
go full ussr and set up something like the nkvd on zeon supports as well as dangerous elements in the ef make lots of propaganda about newtypes being autistic and the gundams a i did all the work    also take over anaheim
  lower the mandatory conscription age for males  raise the mandatory conscription age for females  profit
  this this this nothing but this
  peace with spacenoids  expose the jovian conspiracy  cull the bureaucracy  suspend democracy  invade jupiter  gas the jovians  space war now
  kek
  of dendrobiums
  you might as well be taiwan in that case
  colony drop on mars en masse the effect of hundreds spacenoid dying on mars will hopefully terraform it
  this but id also add investing heavily in a diplomatic relationship with jupiter
i try and reform my tax laws regarding colonies and make a big show of unifiying earth and space i put in place laws for mandatory ms rearmament every five yearsso the ef never gets stuck with outdated shitty ms also i streamline army command structure and bureucracy so rapid mobilization and deployment becomes easier all across the earth sphere ohand i depopulate the entire side 3moving denizens all across the earth sphere and i make being a zeek a punishable offense    i probably go out of my way to make sure zeon remnants dont remainby either reintegrating what parts of the zeon military resources and personnel into the newly reorganized efsf or keeping the space forces and army busy hunting down any that still exist and i plan out an invasion plan for taking jupiterand securing utter unity for mankind across space
  diplomatic relationship with jupiter  get them to sell fuel only to the ef
  you got my voted
give more representation to colonies so they stop sperging out nationalize anaheim or make snri early quietly eliminate jamitov the only dangerous one bask was just a goon oh and prepare to fuck up delaz axis and jupiter in that order
establish think tanks to combat contolism and put heavy environmental restoration efforts into place to make zeonism redundant sponsor exchange programs to further unify colonies and earth     also give them benefits from trading with earth like cheaper gundarium alloy
rainy day and day    dun chikka dun dadun chikka dun dun    
ahhh crap
cool thread mind if i join
  wow good thread interesting op whats really interesting is obaris involvement in the show i really hope that doesnt become an excuse to bump this thread well past the point of its discussions expiration
what are your thoughts on obaris character designs
  i masturbated to gowcaizer
  breasts too small
  thats because it was from the era where he was drawing characters in an art style thats pretty close to his now exwifes
  what the fuck thats really interesting i was just watching the magic knight rayearth op for some nostalgia and then i saw this picture  i was wondering why two seemingly unrelated series have stoiclooking long black haired dudes with half his face shaded and something weird going on with his eye which theres also a similar shot in the vbs op so both of them are in the ops as well then i saw your post so i look up who his exwife is lo and behold shes the character designer for the rayearth anime small world
  yeah buddy just keep making the same thread its not like we got enough time with the last one you fucking weirdo
  that sequence with zagato in the op is actually from obari theres a few projects they worked on together either in a staff capacity or with obari as part of g1
  get educated
this is the transformed bancho brider  say something nice about him
do you idiots know what youve done by bumping this do you know what kind of autism youve enabled
  hm
  go
  havent really been keeping up with anime lately but i keep seeing this ones name which means its really popular if its somehow making its way to my ears but usually the general anime community doesnt really go for mecha so what makes this one enticing to them
  dude the faggot op would just bump it himself by page 9 anyhow were better off filling it to bump limit as soon as possible to kill it though evidently hell just make another anyway so it doesnt really matter either way i suppose
  as soon as possible  its been a whole day since i made that post and this thread is still nowhere near bump limit your soon isnt soon enough
  i want this gone as fast as possible but if its not fast enough do nothing and let it hang around for 100 days again instead
    dude you realize this is the second thread right    you realize what im going to do if this hits bump limit right
  it has a female character with big ol titties and one with a fat ass on top of that its just really good
  no shit i knew you were dumb but you cant even read right i said you were going to keep bumping it anyway and then youll just make another to keep pretending anyone cares about your shit opinions thats why i told   it doesnt matter if other people respond because youd just talk to yourself for the next 3 months again anyway
  how come this triggers you so much is it so hard to just hide the thread and forget about it
  you spend who knows how many days talking to yourself just to bump your own thread then act like im the one who cares too much lol okay buddy  actually theres probably a mecha sub reddit we could point you to if you want theyll save whatever inane bs you want to post for years at a time and you get a neat little screen name and even gold star stickers to boot that seems more your speed
  i use both reddit and 4chan freely
  we could tell
  we  ah a fellow redditor i see
  its trigger  everything trigger does is premium shitposting material  and occasionally fun to watch too
  whats up with this picture
  thighs
f e e t
  based
  indeed
how do i get into gundam
  you dont fuck off
  release order if youre ambitious or just pick a more modern standalone series that looks cool and start there 00 is pretty newcomerfriendly
watch it
  this you can go now
if universal century production order starting with the original series aus watch whatever you want its not so difficult that you need a guide but just in case ive got you covered
  pick a show that looks good and watch it some people will tell you to watch in production order you can do that if you want but its honestly not important most gundam shows are aus that have nothing to do with one another and even if youre watching a later uc show youll pick up on what you need to know about the setting through osmosis soon enough watch something that looks like itll be fun to you thats really all there is to it
0079
  read this and youre set
you get into the cockpit
  everything contested except buy all our play sets and toys the animation  this list is utter shit    op look up the mobile suit gundam movies gundam the origin gundam 00 and g gundam in that order and watch the first one that looks good to you those are all good gateway series ordered by most to least relevant to other gundam shows
  through the cockpit like everyone else motherfucker
  zeta  generally accepted  less contested than fucking 0079  found one troll chart right there
first you pick a gundan show then you watch it  its that simple
you download 0079  you watch it  bam you are in gundam now
  start with metal armor dragonar
you dont its absolutely horrendous anyone that praises it is a normalfag that doesnt know anything about anime
guys i dont want to watch any gundam but i want to act like i have what kinds of things should i say to seem like i know what im talking about
  number 1 is definitely fuck space niggers  number 2 is gihren did everything wrong  you can wing it from there
  watch 0079 try the show and if you dont like the pace then watch the movies instead    anyone who tells you that starting with a more modern show is safer is dumb release time has very little to do with accessibility the newer it is the more sequel baggage it carries
  rile people up with hot takes such as char is a good/bad newtype/pilot/person or girhen/degwin/deikun did nothing/everything wrong
  claim to have watched every work including obscure ones like gsaviour and evolve then get caught out when someone discusses zz and you have no idea who judau or puru are
you become a neckbeard and skip showers
  how do i get into 2hu
  you start with the games about at like 6 or 7 and ignore all the ancillary material with religious zeal
  nigga what the fuck does that even mean the only thing that applies is hm
  have you tried constructing a portal to gensokyo first
  i dont understand your confusion or what the fuck your second sentence even means
  answer my question and then ill answer yours
  half of the series are standalone alternative universes that can be started with little to no prior knowledge required see    alternatively you can start with the main timeline the universal century by watching the original series its compliatation movies or reading the origin manga
  production order for universal centery main time line    only exception is maybe 0080 first if youre curious what gundam and just want to test the waters without getting in too deep but its the only show i could see watching out of production order    any order you want for all other spin offs seed 00 g ibo because none of them are connected
should i start with turn a
  start at the 6th or 7th game
  start with the 6th or 7th game and ignore the material which is not the primary series  how is this in any way hard to understand you literal brainlet
its amazing how many people need to be told to start from the beginning youd think its kinda obvious
  dont bother its shit just like macross
    starting with eosd  eh i guess
  if you want to start with hrtp more power to you its how i did things and i dont regret it one bit
  the absolute madman i think 8 is a fine entry though probably the easiest out of the first few mainline games to make this /m/ i cant believe the kappas made some /m/ stuff and barely uses them
  to make this /m/  shame on you then for skipping soew which has evil eye sigma the /m/est thing in the franchise beside hisoutensoku
  no leave it for later its rather unique and different from the rest  preferably after watching some uc and some of the older aus
  its also more irrelevant than mima
pick a robot that looks cool  watch the series its from     thats it rinse and repeat with other robots you like
i just went by production order
  that was savage
watch in production order so you have some bragging rights over fags that started with/have only watched seed or wing
  no wonder most 00 fans are obnoxious faggots
    origin  not canon nor good fuck off
is there a gundam mobage were self insert can be buddies with other gundam characters
  go watch 00 if you like that go watch more
movie trilogy  0083  zeta  zz  chars counter attack  unicorn  narrative  f91  victory
  movie trilogy  no 0080
  counting bad spinoffs
  fuck off
  f91 is both worse and more of a spinoff than 0080
    hit the open hatch button
  i want you to die
  its better animated and has much more interesting action scenes
more like centurion
  arent real grades wonderful  when theyre not fragile hand grenades
    i feel like the rg is the only rendition of the tallgeese to get the shoulder binders right i have owned the tallgeese 1 and 3 msias the tallgeese 3 rd and the hcm pro and literally every time i found myself wishing they were connected to the torso via those mounting brackets that were on the kaiyodo temjin from virtual on    pic related
you know the drill post news and share your thoughts
  the theme is 100 as described from the leak    i dont know how people are still denying it lmao
  assuming the leaks are real what is there to look forward to give me everything you know
ill post the other figures
  now i can understand what pic related was really talking about
  copypasting from an older thread  eco terrorists want to unleash the monsters that are being held in monarch bases they let a newly born mothra escape while getting a machine that the monsters called titans in the movie respond to they awaken king ghidorah referred to as monster zero at this point who was frozen and being studied at a base in antarctica godzilla shows up but gets his ass kicked    ecoterrorists go to mexico to unleash another titans its rodan whos fire based now for some reason both godzilla and ghidorah show up godzilla and rodan fight for a bit but before godzilla can kill him ghidorah starts attacking godzilla godzilla manages to bite off one of his heads the military shoots an experimental weapon called an oxygen destroyer at them godzilla seemingly dies but ghidorah not only survives but reveals that he can completely regenerate his head ghidorah screams and causes all the titans on earth to go on a rampage rodan becomes his bitch    monarch finds out godzilla is still alive because mothra sends signals at him their ancestors worked together all the time and so monarch plans to revive him with nukes due to bullshit the only way to do it is to manually detonate it at his face asian guy ken watanabe from the first movie does it dies in the process godzilla is now supercharged which is what the op the newly released photo of godzilla from kotm is depicting the titans are drawn to boston where the final battle takes place    mothra godzilla and the military all work together to stop ghidorah mothra brutally wounds rodan with a stinger its revealed to have ghidorah kills mothra godzilla uses atomic aura blasts to melt away most of ghidorah and then eats him alive ghidorahs is trying come out from his mouth but godzilla uses atomic breath killing him for good the other titans including rodan show up and see godzilla as the alpha titan and literally bow to him
  main character is an exmonarch scientist whose son died in the san francisco battle in the first movie he had falling out with his wife whos also a monarch scientist because shes still sympathetic to the titans despite what happened he left the organization and her to raise their daughter on her own    movie opens with the exwife and her kid at the base thats studying the egg of mothra mothra awakens and starts freaking out the exwife uses the opportunity to use a machine shes been working called the orca that sends out frequencies the titans respond to she successfully uses it to calm baby mothra then the ecoterrorists show up kidnap the exwife and kid along with their machine mothra escapes in the confusion and goes a into a cocoon in a waterfall    monarch reaches out to the main character since he helped his exwife build orca and can track the frequencies they use he doesnt get along with the monarch characters since they all have boners for the titans hes able tell that the ecoterrorists are headed to antarctica the ecoterrorists are lead by an exbritish special forces guy played by charles dance who grew to resent humanity after all the wars hes been in a team is sent to take out the terrorists and rescue the exwife and the kid the main guy sneaks into the base himself he finds his family but they dont wanna go the exwife activates orca and awakens ghidorah both human groups barely escape while ghidorah goes on a rampage back at monarch everyone is confused as to why the exwife freed ghidorah they get a broadcast from the bitch herself and she explains that she was working for the terrorists the whole time she explains that they want to free the titans so they can stop humanity from fucking the planet and let nature control itself again main guy and the bitch argue for a bit and she reveals that she raised the kid to believe the same nonsense
  main guy is understandably upset the terrorists head to mexico to unleash rodan the kid is having second thoughts after seeing what ghidorah can do the bitch assures her that everything is under control they awaken rodan and lots of people die the kid is now super not on board    the main guy starts to warm up to godzilla and helps the other guys come up with a way to revive him so he can stop ghidorah they track godzilla to an ancient city deep within the ocean its a place where people once worshipped godzilla and its full of radiation that he feeds off from they take a sub take so they can use a nuke to jump start him the thing that fires the missiles is not working the only way the plan would work is for someone to physically take the nuke to godzilla and detonate it but it would be suicide because of the high radiation ken watanabe volunteers himself and says goodbye to his comrades he sets up the nuke in front of godzilla he puts his hand on godzilla and tells him goodbye old friend in japanese
  the plan worked and godzilla is ready to throw down with all the titans running around major cities are being evacuated including boston where the terrorists are hiding the bitch realizes that ghidorah is basically evil and will fuck up everything harder than humans ever could she urges the british guy to let her hook up the orca to the speaker system in fenway park to lure all the titans there so hopefully one of them can take out ghidorah british guy doesnt really care but the kid overhears the conversation and sneaks out with the orca to do her moms plan    the kid successfully lures the titans to boston but is attacked by ghidorah the mom realizes what happened and goes out to save the kid the ecoterrorists dont help her and they fuck off for the rest of the movie the final battle happens ghidorah and godzilla are the only ones left but godzilla is losing the family is reunited but see godzilla having trouble the mom decides to redeem herself and uses the orca to distract ghidorah long enough for godzilla to get his shit together the mom dies and godzilla kills ghidorah in the after credits the british guy buys what i think is supposed to be a newly born destroyah from some fishermen its hard to tell since the cgi isnt finished    taken from some /co/fag who evidently saw a test screening other anons and people on other sites who had seen the screening backed him up and the sdcc trailer and now some of the new material pretty much confirmed it  there is disagreement as to whether what dance buys at the end is a juvenile destoroyah or the severed ghidorah head either due to unfinished effects or the studio filming two different versions
  there are a few more detailed summaries out there   additional details that seem to jive with what weve seen today  the aforementioned theme which plays in the scene where godzilla rises from the sea after being revived by the nuke  dead fish floating from the oxygen destroyer in the teaser   the decapitated muto head is shown preserved in a monarch base
  did you hear that fucking new version of the original ost holy fuck
i fuckin told yall the sketch leaks were real
  look at dem gams
how are people still denying the leak at this point literally everything we have seen so far has been previously talked about in the leak
  sounds like fanservice overload desu
mothras theme is also confirmed by dougherty btw    
  man even with all the hype of the monster designs and music im still scared that the narrative and characters are going to be as bland as every other hollywood flick even more so after something as refreshing as shin godzilla
  complaining about bland characters in the same breath as complimenting shins characters    shin has a lot of strengths but characterization is not one of them
  looks a lot thinner now
  but they served their purpose in the story the characters were different from what were used to see in special effects films i thought that it was really interesting and different how they were handled i mean a fucking heavy political drama in a godzilla film fuck me if that isnt an interesting aproach  im scared that they go the classic family cliches in kotm
  yaguhci is one of the best leads in the franchise i challenge you to name someone better
  barely remember him desu american chick was far more memorable
    her engrish was fantastic     its us/japan so win/win
  nah he was great his autistic devotion to his job and knack for assembling talent was the good stuff
  his autistic devotion to his job  that just makes him an average japanese person
  it would make sense to me that its juvenile destroyah since it plays a pivotal role in the film as well as it being a good villain for kong and goji to team up against
mothra and godzillas ancestors were partners in crime back in the day  that is actually fucking great would explain why her wings mimic godzillas eyes
  guys i kinda want to fuck mothra now
    somehow mothra is erotic w  even japs wanna fuck her now     imagine the porn
  so far im not too fond of the redesigned dorsal fins theyre now closer to the classic design but i dont think it works too well on legendarys fat body part of what made the 2014 design work is how the spikier and spaced out dorsal fins contrasted with fatzillas fat      what the fuck thats actually pretty nice      i dig this
  imagine how proud the designer of mothra is right now he/she made a fuckable mothra
  someone also said she looks like guillermo del toro designed her
  bear mccrearys rendition of the godzilla theme is pretty kickass desu  
another angle
  also i think those are supposed to be fluffy antennae on her head like picrelated but its hard to tell with the plastic
  she really does look humanoid  its the long back legs that do it
  does she have 6 legs or is it just 4
  6 two smaller ones are tucked between the large front ones
  this is actually a statue not a figure in case anyone doesnt know additionally the directors official word on the redesign  these spikes come from the 1954 version and i made his feet a little bit biggerhe needed bigger claws godzillas spikes are his crown so they needed to be big    source  
    damn near 20 years without king ghidorah  now this beautiful terror king and the animated eldritch horror arrives  worth the wait
so no new trailer yet can probably expect one soon with all this new stuff coming out yeah
  its coming next week
  they said next week so hopefully that means this upcoming week and not the one after
  godzillas spikes are his crown  so they needed to be big  that is strong
    oh boy just in time for my birthday i cant fucking wait
  god i love how doughtrey describes godzilla    oh thank god he has eyes
  his wings look like hands constantly spread as if to grab at something
  look at this happy bastard hes blowing cities away and not giving a fuck about it
  it seems like they incorporated cricket legs into her design maybe to allow her to have a fast takeoff by kicking off the ground
  i can see that hopping into air and catching herself on the wings way less awkward than flapping them a few meters off the ground
  plus itll allow for some creative fighting if she involves some powerful kicks in her arsenal
here is a 2chan thread where they have promo and concept art in the thread get in here before the thread die 
  hey godzilla im gonna say the nword
praise the moth goddess
this fucking song  this fucking song right here  when i listen to it  it just fits with godzilla  i dont know why  but it just fits  
  im digging that poster
  i thought they have their own memes
new mothra has a really similar bodyshape to the mutos    i wonder if theyre retconning those as a battra style offshoot of her species
  yep they definitely also want to fuck the moth    also somebody compared ghidora to this painting it fits too well to be a coincidence
  you owe me awe
  we took memes including the gaijin 4koma from them a gorillion years ago so fairs fair i guess memes are a two way street plus these past few years it feels like so many memes have been used to make people feel bad so its nice to have a reminder that laughter can bridge distances to bring us together
mothra confirmed waifu of 2019
  im not complaining just surprised
slightly off topic    would we ever get a suit this animated in a mainline toho movie or would it be out of their budget     im starting to think its the best goji suit from a technical perspective as memey as that sounds
  i dont think well ever get a suit anymorenot even from toho
  doesnt look like a suit
  actually is done by ilm   
  do you think well get a suit from someone else and if so who
  doubt it shin was done all in cg but was designed to resemble a rubber suit which made it seem more realistic i reckon they could go down that route and add a bit more dynamic movement to the monsters and it would look alright
    that choir chanting gojira is fuckin cheesy as shit
  and yet its okay when the twins sing to mothra
japan gives us fuckable mothgirls  usa gives us fuckable mothra  im not complaining
fw kamacuras on battra wings   false goddess    the other two are 10/10 though rodan is an absolute badass      it works for me during the busy parts but the final gojira at the end is overdoing it
    well yeah man their singing is the main melody in the song    you really thought you were doing something there huh
  fair trade anime films had no mothra fight so kotm more than makes up for this by making her fuckable as well as giving her fights
    for some reason when i look at his face i picture an aussie
  why did i laugh
im glad they fixed godzilla probably went as far as they could without making a completely different design theyve just about abandoned everything from the first movie and im not complaining
  no rodan thats racist you cant say the n word
i found a longer version of the new theme the only problem is theres a lot more background noise and talking going on so its a little harder to hear    
  ey wheres my nigga maguma poster
  he was never broken
  extra thicc
  mothra doing some chun li shit
bug is not for fug
  is bug for hug
im glad doughertys doing this movie i was hoping hed break into the mainstream and hes perfect for godzilla imo
even the japanese audiences are turning away from toho produced godzilla movies in favor of kotm     how can toho ever recover
  what are you talking about
  54 spines dont work as one solid clor and the tail was cooler with the whip  no biggie but its a step back
  weebs blown the fuck out  theyll come crawling back to toho as will everyone else when the director of godzilla vs kong fucks up
  they work just fine for me
  this  doughtery seems to know what hes doing but i have far less confidence in winguard
  doughtery is very passionate about the whole thing even the actors on twitter are getting involved in the arg hes set up  meanwhile i havent heard a thing about wingard talking about the film even though theyve already started filming
  he had a bunch of interviews before filming started        the script for godzilla vs kong comes to us from a writers room run by terry rossio who cowrote the pirates of the caribbean films and also holds a story credit on 1998s godzilla the room also included star trek beyond and star trek 4 writers patrick mckay and jd payne the kingkiller chronicles writer lindsey beer queen of the air writer cat vasko maze runner and pacific rim uprising writer ts nowlin and comic and television writer j michael straczynski    even jms is involved im now really curious
  straczynski is involved thats actually really neat never thought id see him work on a godzilla thing
  gotta agree i liked it when i first heard it but i feel its one of those things that could entice laughter from some dipshits in the theater like i heard many people laughed their asses off when they dramatically said gojira in the first movie
    why would any one include 1998 godzilla as a credit thats like a hooker listing aids on her craigslist page
  he looks so happy
  the funny thing is that rossios original script was thrown out anyway getting the credit for it is writers guild thing where your name stays on the script if you ever touched any version of it at all
  i feel like those people who like at two totally distinct mecha designs and say they look the same
man everything just looks so fucking good what the fuck is the catch to all this im excited but nervous
  apparently despite resembling a walrus maguma in the movie is stated to be of reptilian origin
  what the fuck is the catch to all this  godzilla vs kong
        relax guys there is this
  alright his love for kong is giving me slight hope
  i mean itll be interesting to see batman vs superman but with godzilla mothra kong and whoever the main villain is actually it fucking wont
  based
  unironically praising kke  absolutely based i wish him the best
            also this is a quote of his     godzilla has gone through so many iterations hes been a bad guy hes been a good guy hes been a conflicted guy theres so many different things you can do with it but its not drawing on one core story and its always been about the evolution of the character theyre going in a great direction with it so far i just went on the set of godzilla 2 got to peak in on that and it looks totally awesome and the vibe that theyre going for is great its a cool tradition to jump into but its also one of those things where at a certain point you have to take it very seriously even though these are big wild monster movies the origin of that is really from world war ii and hiroshima if you watch that first film its really a sad movie its a really depressing exploration of that so you always have to remember at the end of the day the reason youre here is because a major catastrophe took place theres this underlying darkness under it all but at the end of the day it is for kids as well its evolved into this whole other thing that means so many things to different people
  actually it fucking wont  why anon
so whats the deal with mothras wings lighting up
    so now that we have images of what the legs look like the question is will we have ghidorah walking around like a typical hollywood wyvern think reign of fire or smaug something more birdlike the traditional stance or something in between
  im guessing b
  breeding signal
  bioluminescence
  producers demanding to make everything look blue and vidyalike this time
  im gonna say a mix of a and b walks upright but keeps his wings folded
  i want him to run around whlie in the b form i think it makes him look more aggressive
  she has bioluminescent wings that can presumably used as some form off offense
  rossio did the gryphon script that was gonna have effects by stan winston and actually was looking pretty good then they threw it away and he still got credit per what  said
  king gidohra brought his own weapons to the fight
  apparently she can focus the light into the eye markings and fire it off as powerful beams
  he doesnt know about fire rodan the leaker not you
the second coming of mothra    moth frontal
    see this is how you organize a sequel to a movie like this get people who give a shit about the source material and arnt just basedboys    fuck you pacific rim 2 just fuck you
  i hope legendary gives gundam to a proper filmmaker too not even necessarily a fan but at least somebody who gives a fuck and does thorough research
  mfw some random humans kidnap my baby brother and this giant lizard fuck claims him as his son
  im so mad im gonna take a shit on space mountain
best boy
  think reign of fire  wow grandpa thats ancient how about using an example thats relevant
  okay how about rathalos in the monster hunter movie
  wow i like this guy but i still dont get why it sounds like theyre actually making it kong vs godzilla rather than kong and godzilla teaming up but having a vs in the title because reasons
    not thin enough what is godzilla eating mountains of fish people radioactive material    dont mind me im just mad at his fat redesign even shingodzilla was more fun and i hardly consider it godzilla even its still possible to design a good looking thinzilla like the one they made for the last ps4 game the game was shit but the godzilla was a nice mix in between showa and heisei imo
  because theyre gonna be enemies until a villain destroyah is introduced in the third act
  i wonder if well get burning godzilla concept art leaks leading up to godzilla vs kong
  heiseis thunder thighs were much fatter than legendarys proportions especially now i dont think i want to see a godzilla much smaller than 
  why is there a big dorat there
  it has arms it cant be a dorat
    gigan was an overgrown dorat/malformed ghidorah  the cockroaches snatched him and made him a cyborg  the xiliens further made him more robotic unrecognizable from his organic form  headcanon accepted
  im already losing it that rodan made it to the big screen  is gigan makes it im going to go bananas
actual best boy coming through  tfw monstervese version never
king kong will face godzilla    uh how is that not going to be a total stomp in godzillas favor
  apparently kong is still growing so by then he should at least reach godzillas shoulder
  movie magic  just like godzilla and the rest of the planet surviving the confrontation with this ghidorah somehow
why is toho thinking about pulling out they have a good thing going with free good publicity and money for the brand their films could never hope to achieve
  jealousy
  jealousy
  they blew their load with shin nothings ever going to top it
  it will for one reason alone  godzilla vs king kong is a better batman vs superman movie than bvs
the godzilla/kong relationship is going to be interesting seeing how its going to be very hard to villainize this godzilla
  you dont have to villainize godzilla just make him out to be kind of a dickcoldblooded if you will  godzilla swims out to skull island in pursuit of baby destroyah or whatever it ends up being  kong tells goji to piss off  they fight kong gets his ass beat  they then team up somewhere on the mainland for the final showdown
  implying they wont fight for the king of monster island
  they then team up somewhere on the mainland for the final showdown  why do vs movies have to have an epic teamup nowadays just let them beat each other up and whoever wins wins
    im imagining this initial confrontation now    cut to skull island where a lizardboi is chasing a couple of buffalo  it corners the herd but before he can eat any a massive foot crushes the skull  pan up to a 300 foot grizzled scarred kong maybe even slightly grey  he looks out over the horizon peering into the ocean  he snarls  dorsal plates    that doesnt sell as many toys mister anon
  because the large movie going public is afraid to watch a movie about a fucking loser from what i remember kong skull island just barely squeaked into being considered a success so hes got to be sacrificed to the gman
  dont be rude
so what are the other titans the description of the leak sounds like there are meant to be more than just godzilla rodan mothra and ghidorah are there a bunch of the more minor monsters from the franchise like kamacuras or something
  titanosaurus of course    i wish
  yeah theres apparently a bunch of other monsters even the director has revealed as much in interviews    the leakers tried describing them but they say the effects were so unfinished that they couldnt really make them out they say one is a giant mammoth thing
    things leakers have been describing include a giant mammoth the loch ness monster a harryhausenesque cyclops and possibly anguirus and kumonga
  going back to the prototype
what the fuck is wrong with all of you    dont do this to my childhood heroes     mothra is a pure girl do not lewd the moth goddess
  good taste anon very good taste     10/10 our boy is the goat
  wait what do you mean pulling out out of the loop here are they pulling out of supporting monsterverse or are they god forbid pulling out of making godzilla movies
  allegedly they only license godzilla and other monsters to legendary until 2020 what happens after then nobody knows toho stated they want to make a godzilla shared universe or something like that no word on whether they will renew the legendary license or not so far
  under the current contract godzilla vs kong will be the last american movie
  they might not renew the license but thats just toho being slow if hollywood continues to show interest in the future then well get more eventually not the brightest thing to not follow up right away but thats just how toho does
  still got you to think about it though
    full gktom panel in good quality
  the main guy starts to warm up to godzilla and helps the other guys come up with a way to revive him so he can stop ghidorah they track godzilla to an ancient city deep within the ocean its a place where people once worshipped godzilla and its full of radiation that he feeds off from they take a sub take so they can use a nuke to jump start him the thing that fires the missiles is not working the only way the plan would work is for someone to physically take the nuke to godzilla and detonate it but it would be suicide because of the high radiation ken watanabe volunteers himself and says goodbye to his comrades he sets up the nuke in front of godzilla he puts his hand on godzilla and tells him goodbye old friend in japanese

  damn this is so lovecraft
  did he are you so sure
  i know but it was too late to fix it so whatever
  0/10 hollywood cgi trash
  once the train of thought has begun it is too late to stop it for it has no brakes
  human ish face  i mean two eyes and a mouth what more do you need
  sounds like theyre actually making it kong vs godzilla rather than kong and godzilla teaming up but having a vs in the title because reasons  if its good enough for japan its good enough for me   example shin getter vs neogetter
  skipping ab day
  swiggity swooty
welp mothra confirmed waifu of 2019 once the movie rolls out in theatres
  mothra is not for lewd
  but they never team up in the ova they were never even in the same shot together
  he fat
  her fuck me eyes say otherwise
  all those mothra larvae gotta come from somewhere anon
  i wish that his body was bigger but besides that its a solid design ghidorah should feel heavy when you look at him not light      i wish her body was a bit bigger too but i appreciate that they kept color in her wings considering how obsessed hollywood is with muting colors      literally fire rodan and its perfect    i thought 14 sucked but i have a good feeling about this one the krampus showed me that this director understands what makes a monster movie and doesnt put his head up his ass like edwards did so i feel like were going to get some great payoffs
  im going to give you the benefit of doubt and assume you accidentally overlooked him
  hug the mothra  then give her plenty of children
  those are clearly toy versions and not total versions because they completely missed every rebirth of mothra mothra too
  i took it that he was only counting versions that appeared in godzilla movies kaiser ghidorah is a separate character so only anime ghidorah is missing
will godzilla and king ghidorah be a good fight based on early screenings
  spend hours and hours with her do not stop until youre completely spent and pass out from sheer exhaustion
    isnt the fire referencing how he died in his original solo movie
  its a pretty conservative take on king ghidorah really not that godzilla or mothra are unrecognizable but i was expecting a bigger change
    unironically a better ghidorah design than what urobutcher shat out
  acknowledging those dogshit anime movies    not even once
  the 2014 godzilla movie didnt really make that much money in japan the 98 one made much more it didnt flop but with shin being successful critically commercially and even culturally i can see them being disappointed with the legendary deal in comparison to that
  if monster zero were to fly again the stratosphere would be torn open by an otherworldly tempest of thunder and lightning our sky has never seen     goddamn im hyped now
    the guy seems very enthusiastic about the film
  host dude losing his shit over the new spikes  funneh
how do i delete someone post on 2chan because the first guy who comment on this thread about ghidorah said it look weak 
  just let him be a faggot and dont be a faggot yourself
  oh dear
i just got to know the godzilla section of comiccon is here holy fuck im stoked for friday for the trailer    mccreary thank you for being fans of toho shits you did well with the theme holy fuck im gonna get fucking goosebumps in the threatre
  fucking tunjukkan kesaktianmu mothra its in my fucking language okay im so gonna sing it if theres even the slightest beat of the classic theme song of hers
  godzilla eyes pattern  neato
  2chan  being dumb    after their noodle ghidorah that got instagibbed they have no right to speak
  nigga these are the same fags who made the fatzilla comments that somehow ended up getting picked up on a news article and then a game of telephone was played with it and the whole 2chan thing was forgotten
  tbh i cant wait for hers since mccreary said there will be homage to the classic theme songs praying that it will be there and given how he did justice with godzillas theme i cant wait hope he doesnt completely modernize it better keep that mystical indonesian/malay sway to it
    godzilla fans are such spoiled brats the star wars fandom had a legitimate reason to complain
    i was simply comparing movie versions that appeared in godzilla movies i went with figures since its a more fair comparison to the kotm designs at the current time     theres not really a good toy of anime ghidorah so i left him out and the rest havent appeared in godzilla movies proper or are different characters
  thats just one faggot in that one thread most japs like it
  ummm maybe they should try not being a bunch of hateful sexist bigots
  shin was a lightning in a bottle anno got away with imposing his vision on the project but he and his codirector both said they have absolutely no interest in returning for another film so toho are on their own they can be disappointed all they want but realistically this is their best bet
  he looks like such a cunt i love em
  a sequel to shin godzilla is a terrible idea it should remain a standalone film there are a number of other talents they could hire to write and direct a godzilla film and im pretty sure shinji higuchi said we was willing to come back    tohos biggest problems were depending on inhouse hacks and a ridiculously tight release schedule on that note the director of the kiryu films said he was interested in directing another godzilla movie      this its box office wasnt too good at all in japan even worse when you consider how it was the first godzilla film in a decade
  yyou better eat up this shit sandwich you spoiled brats
  is this to scale
  but they served their purpose in the story    that is the weakest defense of shins shitty characters ive ever seen hell bland as ford was i can at least remember his name shins characters are barely people theyre more like robots
  exactly theyre regular asian people
  you belong in the trash for that lol now i cant stop laughing
  godzilla 2014 is a character driven film in the spirit of spielberg you know the guy famous for likable characters sentimentality and moving audiences but the acting story and dialogue of godzilla 2014 leave a lot to be desired what is there to take away from that movie besides the visuals and a single performance its skip to the monster action incarnate     shin godzilla shows the mobilization of nation against a threat and its entirely devoted to dealing with said threat and its consequences its nearly two hours in length as is and thats with its swift pace the characters have enough personality to be distinguishable and yaguchi is one of the best leads in the series theyre bolstered by commentary on national and international politics social issues and responsibility and agency i also enjoy annos autistic attention to detail and his directing/editing theres more life and thought to it than most of the few decades of godzilla combined
shinfags are always the fans get the most defensive if anything bad is said about their movie its hilarious not even tljfags get this butthurt    i like shin but i think it could improve on one aspect  3 paragraph copy pasted rant on how shin is literally perfect and anyone who says it could improve is a blasphemer
  you are literally the only person on this planet who remembers that guys name
  i think most of these people are actually annofags and only worship shin because its his movie
  not remembering fords name
  character driven    that right there is where you lost me cranstons character had so much emotion backstory and motivation to him so if edwards didnt fucking kill him off i wouldve agreed    but instead he kills the charismatic character with a compelling story and replaces him with a block of wood who has a convenient reason to stick around he isnt compelling you never care about him you never celebrate his triumphs hes just there thats the exact same thing with serizawa who just sits around and grumbles trailer lines
  i wish theyd just stuck with the original script for that movie where ford brody and scarlet witch i dont remember the characters name or the actress are siblings and cranston lives till the end of the movie
    i agree they fucked up with killing cransons character another look we killed him isnt this movie epic its much bigger than one single character and his motivations pretentious trope being usedfor the detriment of what could have been a really good movie that said i hated the musos as well
  hed make kaijin real and wouldnt give a shit about the damage they caused  the director is truly /ourguy/
  this series takes a lot of cues from the gamera trilogy i feel like    2014 was beat for beat gotu and it seems like theyre taking cues on the underwater civilization thing unless they used rebirth of mothra 2 or atragon as reference instead
  the mutos were probably the only good aspect of the film besides the sense of scale unfortunately they had no room to shine you barely see them ever do anything and their design feels like the average current monster design
inb4 some nutcase has idea for godzilla film set thousands of years into the future where humans have already left earth not because of godzilla like in anime films and have colonised other planets leaving more screentime to godzilla fighting extraterrestrials alongside mothra anguirus and rodan and appearance of one transformable mechag sent by colony as way to document earths status after all these years
  movie should have focused on bryan cranston and ken watanabe that would have been true kino but instead they kill off or give all the best actors nothing to do why they had all the resources to make oscartier substance and why are the action sequences so dark
  and why are the action sequences so dark  i assume if you cant see the cg they dont have to spend as much time making it look good and more time is more money thrown at animators so at the end of the day its quicker and cheaper to make
    ythe design was my main gripe and yeah this could probably have been remedied if they were given more time to show off stuff but they didnt so i wish they just stuck to godzilla and kept it about him and the humans
  it doesnt help that the home release of the movie is way darker then it was in theaters seriously i remember being able to follow the action just fine in the theater but then the dvd comes out and everything is like 40 darker
  i like how that anon tried to deflect something shitty by citing something else thats shitty    its ok that this movie series sucks because this other movie series suck too
    coming from a fandom that places vs king ghidorah vs mechagodzilla ii and vs destoroyah on a pedestal i find it laughable that urobuchis films get attacked for bad writing and characters thats my ultimate point and lets not bring godzilla vs mothra into the discussion
  agreed also find it hilarious that some fans are raging about the films attempt to appeal to new demographics by changing up the formula so much
  maybe if i generalize a shit ton of people all with different tastes i can deflect how bad muh animu movies are    also at least kg and mg2 have something there to like whether the batshit zaniness of kg or the beautiful effects in mg2 despite all of their flaws the anime movies have awful animation bad writing dull characters and being nothing interesting to the table that hasnt already been done better
  bring
  raging    acknowledging something as bad isnt the same as being angry
  godzilla vs mothra    you better mean and mothra if youre referring to the original then youre out of your fucking mind
  this is the case you gotta turn the brightness up on the tv and you can see it like you did in the theatres
  amen
    fuck you peta
  batshit zaniness of kg  vs king ghidorah is almost vs megalon bad the writing makes no sense and the wwii stuff is just depressing but i guess its cool in a ironic sense   beautiful effects in mg2  yeah no beautiful effects ended at vs biollante     the heisei characters are the definition of dullness when it comes to godzilla movies and the writing of mimura did nothing to help that the messages are tacked on lip service at best and completely out of place at worst     but please tell me why the anime movies are such a travesty       yes mothra 92 of course
    vs king ghidorah is almost vs megalon bad the writing makes no sense and the wwii stuff is just depressing but i guess its cool in a ironic sense    i enjoy vs megalon in the exact same sense theyre so out there that you cant help but enjoy some of the weird parts thats at least some form of an admirable quality    yeah no  guess well agree to disagree then because i think the saving graces of mg2 are rodan the effects and the score    youre acting like im actively defending the heisei era when im not its the weakest era of godzilla with the best movie still being eh at best    but please tell me why the anime movies are such a travesty   i already said why but sure  horrible animation  bad writing  dull as dirt  uninteresting characters    it takes the reasons i dont like heisei and doubles down with shitty animation
  leftrightcenter
is this kino
  defending tohos nationalist wankfest  automatically devolved into a 2014 vs shin argument rather than trying to let shin stand on its own two legs  couldnt even name a character in shin without looking it up
    this shin godzilla fans are horribly insecure showing signs of blind worship than actual legitimate enjoyment of the film they jerk off how its japanese how its made by anno made a lot of money and all kinds of subjective semantics but never how its actually a quality film that or they devolve into lol but 2014 though    if you have to nervously defensively fall back on comparing it to another film every time then its more likely the other film is the one with a higher quality standard if you actually thought shin godzilla was so good you wouldnt bother bringing up another movie
    responds to a post by someone who made a comparison between the two films in question   how dare you compare those two films   lets just ignore all of the inconvenient matters like context and rage because we dont have anything of value to add rightplenty of people have talked about how shin godzilla is a quality film but you can keep pushing your false narrative
  monster zeros dermal layer is gilded with trace amounts of aurum  
  auric goldfinger would be ____ of ghidorah
if ghidorah gets his middle head blown off like in the heisei movie at the end im gonna freak
i love g14 and dont like shin
  according to the leaks this ghidorah regenerates theyre really trying to make him terrifying and unbeatable
        why are people so sure that these leaks are real
  because they line up with stuff weve learned since then like shots in the trailer and whatnot
  the leaks date back to before comiccon and theyve been very consistent with trailers and what weve heard from crew interviews
  same anon provided drawings of what the kaiju looked like and the scenes they described matched up to scenes seen in the trailer that wasnt released until a week later
  the summary was posted quite a while before the trailer was released and it lines up perfectly with it with details from the leaks both big and small being confirmed also details like the decapitated muto head and the eerie shot of the dead fish were shown to us yesterday    the leaker also described the new godzilla theme that was shown to us in detail over 4 months ago    also the leaker described the designs of the monsters and was right on the money with all of them when they were revealed yesterday    there is a ton of evidence for them and none against them
  why are you so sure they arent real despite all evidence there is being a skeptic and then there is burying your head in the sand
  even those really old sketches that were on a discord or something ages ago and that maquette line up now with the concept art we saw and the final designs
  credits  bobby brown    kek
  muh narrative  implying theres some kind of conspiracy against shin godzilla  trying to prove shin fans arent insecure by being incredibly insecure
the eyes on mothras wings mimic godzillas eyes  god dammit first they make her fuckable then put on her wings the eyes of her war buddy thats just asking to ship them together
    but never how its actually a quality film  plenty of people have talked about why they like it including me     i think the reason the 2014 film is compared to shin so often is partly because of their closeness in release but also because shin embodies a lot of the things that 2014 failed to do shin is an interesting movie because of how it uses a monster to energize different ideas with easily traceable correlates to real life 2014 is a fun enough movie i liked it anyway but its a lot more hollow in comparison because it relies so much on almost gestural use of characters theyre there because its a big hollywood action movie and youre supposed to have them but they dont resonate in any particular way godzilla himself doesnt either beyond being a big brief glimpse of special effects prowess the comparisons are natural because theyre so antithetical to each other despite both being godzilla    shin is by no means a perfect film though
  his reviews are funnier but why didnt he include the money shot from spacegodzilla in his top 10 nude scenes
  id love a monster island movie that has lesser known kaiju  anguirus  baragon  manda  gorosaurus  varan  kumonga  kamacuras  ebirah    the movie can be about anguirus and company having to face off against a more dangerous monster maybe gigan
when that dude in the trailer says long live the king is he referring to godzilla or ghidorah
  ghidorahbecause hes the leader of the antimonarch organization that released the res of the titans on the world
do we know how many times godzilla and ghidorah fight in this movie
  three times
  uncle bobby b baby  rip bernie
so how will the godzilla x mothra ship come out of this film will it explode first due to ironic trending then actually take off because there are some who actually pair the two together
  if some people arent just memeing theres evidently a cheap joke where after mothra gets called queen of the monsters and they mention her species had a symbiotic relationship with godzilla middleditchs character asks if that means godzilla porked her  mothra also evidently dies trying to shield godzilla from ghidorah
  oh dearthat pork line sounds like it gonna set off the entire thing people have already done memes of this pairing but with a character mentioning it thats the point where the ship stops being just a meme and explodes in popularity
  shallow same face japanese characters whos names you cant even remember without looking them up if theyre named at all  godzilla doesnt do anything just walks forward except for when he spergs out and blows up tokyo  isnt even godzilla just some amorphous kaiju with godzillas name and a somewhat similar appearance  soundtrack just just recycled from other movies  hurr japan stronk murica evil  wants to make fukushima commentary but shifts the blame onto another country when japan was the one at fault  wants to criticize the government but thinks the answer is more government    if 2014 is hollow then shin is hollow whitewashed and hypocritical
  all of this
  fuck marvel
  that article is technically from last week just saying
  nationalist    every godzilla movie is nationalistic  
  gmk is anti nationalism you fucking moron    its the only g film to actually criticize japans actions in wwii and how they deny any of it happens today
  happened
    when do we think it will drop fucking marvel is hogging all the airtime with brie larsons flat ass
  we will win them over with mothras fat ass
  would unironically fug the bug over brie anyday  shes got an ugly face an unimpressive body and some nastyass feet
  pretty sure cranston didnt want to be in the movie longer than he had to he was hot off the heels of that drug show and wanted a break
  and shin godzilla is proglobalism or was the whole fact that japan alone could not stop godzilla eludes you
  hardly the movie paints the americans in a very poor light  but muh foreign scientists help stall for time  buddy this aint it
  american drones  american cruise missles  anon
  be hyped for kotm more than any movie in years  marvels annoying fast food movie making ass has to hog it all with their shitty push of a character who has always sucked and their hollow millionth sequel    i wish disney would just go the fuck away
  thanos arc is probably the highest mcu will reach pushing agenda dtiven mary sue characters like captain marvel will be their downfall
  thats kinda hard for a filmmaker to do so when the jsdf is your protagonist and a large number of their military assets are of american make    not to mention those air force bombs that actually made godzilla bleed
  shin godzillas loudest detractors dont understand the movie  every time     the united states isnt evil its just not always understanding of japans perspective and shin godzilla isnt about fukushima like godzilla 54 isnt about hiroshima and nagasaki both use imagery of their respective recent events to help convey their messages
  you still havent told me anything of value yet about the writing and characters     bad example   the last jedi is bad because it has bad characters and writing   good example   the last jedi has bad writing because it wastes the thematic threads leftover from tfa reverts its characters back to square one to learn the same lessons again leaves nowhere interesting for the trilogy to go assassinates lukes character destroys the internal logic of the sw universe has contradictory messages subverts for the sake of subverting at the cost of meaningful storytelling and doesnt commit to its claim of taking the series to new places
  american stealth bombers
since the trailer might not come out this week where can i find footage of that sneak peak of the trailer they showed at the tokyo comic con
  
  directors and producers say its about fukushima  fails to make it a good comparison to fukushima  it no about fukushima u gais    keep moving those goalposts
pastebin of mega from hardworking anons if anyone can catalog whats in the megas thatd be greatly appreciated      prev 
out of all the ultraman references theyve been doing i was not expecting gekiden
ahem  i propose a toast as this is the last ultraman thread before the new 4chan dawns upon us    fuck hiroshimoot fuck mods fuck janniesand fuck ads
  what will happen after new 4chan dawns upon us though its like 10 guys posting here and really on topic too so i dont think this general will be affected in any way
how ironic alien magma has president as their leader  an brutal and aggressive race like them apparently have democracy government while the light kingdom is still monarchy  also whats your thoughts on alien magma in general 
  whats happening to this site      i mean youre dealing with two different races ultraman king is a literal god so it would make sense that its a monarchy alien magmas okay i guess
look at this dude
  he looks like a fucking fish
  dont they usually make some compromises for the black dot eyes if they dont work with a mask/alien features this looks bizarre
    isnt ultraman king not actually the de facto ruler of the land of light  it could be that the land of light has an england thing going on and while they still have a royal family its just for show while the actual governor is chosen by other methods
  well they have the ultra father who they refer to as commander a couple times so its more like a friendly dictatorship by friendly i mean you usually dont get executed as a punishment ie mebius not retreating as ordered only one guy got imprisoned out of the millions of years theyve been around and they have a guy who just does commercials very laid back
  usually no but he did give that big speech in the movie zero debuted in that gave the impression that he commanded top tier respect from everyone there
  there are many kings  for one there is yurians dad
ultraseven x is really weird it kinda felt like they were trying to emulate garo at times especially with the out of suit fights still liked it though even if the ending was kind of meh
  did chaiyo allowed funko to sell ultramanrelated pop funko figures cue the logo
  the mouth in that box art looks a lot better than the one in the pop
  please tell me this is a joke
  
  that looks terrible i actually dont mind most funko pops i dont own any i dont want any but their unifying aesthetic usually kinda works but i have no idea what the fuck is going on with the eyes here
  clearly inspired by the episode where he fought miroganda and got high off his fumes
    full set list here    
   not using ultraseven that actually has somewhat those trademark funko beedy eyes   not using ugly/cute characters like pigmon   using ultraman jack just to not have to make a new mold and cement how much they look the same
  ultracaffine
  alien baltan looks good at least
whats the rule on posting classy nudes of former ultraman science crew women
  only tasteful clothed pictures of hiroko sakurai do anything for me
  probably dont do it or at least spoiler it
    yep just further proof funko pops are lazy cashgrabs at best and abominations unto god at worse
  i insist
ultraman nices design is so good for something thats just for tv ads
  you can even say that the design is nice for advertising
  looks like an ultraman/star trek tng crossover which is cool
  i didnt like x but in part maybe due to the fact that i dont like garo
  despite only making up 13 of the galactic population
    that would be interesting especially since ultras dont jive with the prime directive like earthborn monsters are natural disaster ultraman stepping in to tackle red king or antlar or whatever would be a violation of that
which ultra drew the shortest straw besides justice
  zearth
  theres also the part where the ultras dont really try for the peaceful route either you obey galactic law or you die
  inuniverse the giant whose body was used for evil tiga out of universe millennium
  if its like that then wouldnt the 2 other pyramid ultras have the shorter straw i mean they didnt even get to revive at all they got taken out in their sleep
  ultraseven at least in his own ov series falls into the latter except he was imprisoned 
  justice  i still wonder why they never brought him back considering how many times cosmos has reappeared in the past decade
what was this again
god fuck shf ultraman x is absolutely beautiful im so happy hes in my hands and real
tvnihon has finished ultraman dyna fuck yes lets celebrate
  oh shit so we got complete dyna and tiga now
  yup
  its not like they werent trying things just fell through every single time
  oh right i forgot that justice was supposed to be in ultraman saga
  a two week exhibition leading up to halloween
is ace the trap ultra
just caught up with ultraman r/b it has to be the biggest snooze fest of the franchise
ツルちゃんかわいいよツルちゃん
  and you have the shittiest taste of the general
  i think ultraman has probably seen worse but i agree that r/b has been dull so far i think all of the newer shows have been too selfreferential and toyish for their own good
  the more bell and whistle toy based gadgets ultraman gets the more the story takes the back seat to selling role play toys    just give me my mystery kaiju stories not 4 minutes dedicated to long ass transformations and 2nd/3rd mode toys you have to pitch
  yeah i kinda quit on rb among other things that sphere shoot move is lame and the ultras themselves are kinda pathetic theres also that weird face gold form seems to have so thats also kind of a turn off i might look up the summaries and see which episodes are actually important later when it finishes i got kinda excited when i read somewhere that red finished filming and people thought he died i wasnt excited for him to die but more like for things to change see how things would work if he did
  too bad bro the toys are making more and more money each year
  i aint saying it aint selling    its what happened with kamen rider kabuto more than a decade ago the show is much beloved for characters story and tone but internally it was a failure due to lack of toy sales and role play items
despite the honda directed episodes i never got into return of ultraman from the few episodes i watched     i just finished ultraman leo and im hungry for more ultra series hopefully it clicks this time wish me luck anons
  i thought this got shut down by tsuburaya or are the chinks up to no good again
  r/b is definitely the weakest series of the new generation shows right up there with the original ginga though that show at least had the excuse of having a shoestring budget i think its genuinely improving though sakis much more interesting and less obnoxious than aizen for one      the toy shillings the only thing keeping ultraman afloat though i doubt this is what tsuburaya wants to do judging by the fact that orb origin saga had little to none of that and why theyre branching out to animation with gridman and that netflix anime
  it really makes me sad that toku has just become a toy selling circle jerk
  dragon force
  since when has chinks ever listen to the law
  they were talking about making five more movies or something
  its the only way these shows can make a profit nobodys watching tv anymore and toku doesnt sell as much bds as anime
  im still surprised at how long it took for tsuburaya and toei to get into streaming when thats been a thing for more than half a decade even in japan
  watching ultraman orb origin saga got me thinking if tsuburayas tokusatsu has a better future in streaming services
  orb origin isnt that good so probably no but it really depends on how much they made and idk about that part they also didnt try to push more than a few toys which was a breathe of fresh air
what happened inbetween dyna and ultra galaxy that made shin want to dye his hair in a very flamboyant manner
  wait are tvnihon good now
  more importantly  what made him get fat
  idk maybe they saw seven/taro/leo and assumed all ultras could have eyes like them maybe its just a gross misunderstanding of what the eyes are
  they just barely tolerable and had way worse years ymmv on their fancy animated hardsub fuckery i personally detest it too distracting and hard to read
  its watchable it doesnt have a lot of their usual translation foibles and encoding problems its still hardsubbed though for some reason
  the fansub animations arent really that noticeable in their dyna aside from the op and eds since shin just raises his hand to transform and doesnt say anything in the series
  dynaaaaaaaaa
  chikara no kagiri dyna
  what would the reflasher be like if it made weird jingle noises like modern kamen rider crap
  despite doing that in every recent crossover thing dynas been in shin only does that a handful of times in the actual series surprisingly enough most of the time he just thrusts his hands in the air with the reflasher without saying anything
it still bums me out that nexus never found an audience until it got reaired
happy turkey day /m78/
  happy turkey day hoping for a nonawkward family dinner to yall
  is it worth finishing nexus im up to like episode 30 and finding it a chore
  thats the best part before the rushed ending
new scans out post them boats
  will post after work my dude
  god look at those colors
  oh boy a char ultraman
    inb4 his upgrade form involves him taking the mask off
where the fuck is grigio
  the head is getting larger and larger
what the hell is g/r/b doing with his index finger
  tregias mask looks like its part of a completely different face
  g/r/b  g  isnt it orange as part a clever nod to orb plus theres that pic of an orange ultra
  whats the story with this image they talking about the old pigmon garamon design i love that design
  tsupro dropping the ball at the epilogue again as usual
  old and new pigmon will be in the movie
  this gonna be the shows big bad
  hasnt that been confirmed to be ultrawoman grigio
  thats hikaris new look
  where can i get that gomoras ass
  what is up with those nails
  is this that one kaiju from og man the one that revived a bunch of other kaijus including pigmon
  nah chief is way cooler
what are your predictions and hopes for the next ultra series
  jamila
  predictions  more toys  hopes  back to formula with a defense team
  i want more comfy family stories
  main female ultra
  is top left supposed to be an alternative zetton
  predictions  more soapy intercharacter shenanigans and selfreferential toy shilling  hopes  more experimentation with different themes and conflicts the episodic style of classic ultraman lends itself well to this but it doesnt have to im game for a single ongoing conflict if its fresh and interesting
  expectations  probably the exact same thing weve had for the past few years    hopes  better motw episodes a toy gimmick that isnt just powers of older ultraman and a science patrol team
  its literally just jamila with lipstick
  ultraman q
  original fucking monsters
  this is definitely the most unrealistic expectation for an ultraman series from the past ten years
  i hope we get something similar to x
  mommy hot
  seconding this
  popzetton    coming soon i guess
  i think grigios gonna be more prominent in the movie and just probably gonna have a minor appearance in the series
did one of you from here is him or know him     everytime i see him he always trying so hard to justify his opinion as an objective matter and everyone should agree on his opinion    did one of you from here are him or know him
  asahi looking salty as fuck  mmmm delicious also what are the chances of evil mom
  literally who the fuck cares
  very very low
just finished mebius yapool is now my favorite villain in the entire franchise
  this is for the movie
  ooooh evil ultra for the movie im guessing this is aizen again
  good choice
well this is kind of horrifying
something kinda special about a series being a direct sequel and you get these moments of isnt that
  dyna also has some episodes that feel very star treky its easily one of the more heavily sfish ultraman shows out there
  this fucker is just maverick from top gun isnt he thats awesome
  what if q had 9 forms as a pun on kyuu being the japanese word for 9
  to be fair if god himself came down from heaven and gave a speech would you not be in awe too
  if they can pull it off as well as orb i would not mind at all
does someone have the screencap of aizen sperging out about taxes
  do aliens get representation with all that taxation
  galactron hitting the big times
  nothing      i still find his character to be kinda disappointing
when do we usually get the trailer for the movie
getting btfo by you brother in elementary school   the state of gridman
in a concurrent plot unrelated to the khan digifier a bunch of robbers escape from jail and hides in ippeis basement and holds him hostage  naoto fucking fights the robber who was about to shoot him dead  ippei track the robber down and stood in front of his getaway car delaying him long enough for the cops to show up  old toku can have some hardcore shit
tfw he was a nephilim
gridman can fucking cure cripples   what the fuck
  who is in between king joe custom and imperializer
  the undersea/space robot thing from tigas two parter
what the fuck is tsuburayas obsession with crucifixion
    same thing that the slutty girl getting japanese characters tattooed on her arm has     it looks exotic and cool
  
man ultraman dyna is so comfy its great  i grew up watching ultraman tiga and its amazing finally being able to watch what is essentially more tiga  anyone one else feeling the same
  he liked borrowing ideas from christianity a lot so the company still crucifies their heroes in honor of him or something along that line
  dyna is definitely great but i would disagree on the more tiga part i felt dyna was different enough in its own right to be more than just a sequel for more of the same
what the fuck
  queen  also worth pointing out ojousama is japanese equivalent to mistress for bdsm play  seen in tenchis image song for ayeka
  fair enough the tone definitely feels different  i just meant more tiga because stuff like the sound track sound design special effects kaiju designs are all very similar because it came out a year after tiga i guess i really meant more early heisei ultraman rather than tiga specifically
  kachack   flips open and makes various high notes  dyna ready  do the pose  go    and itd be a bigger toy with switches and stuff you also have to slot in a tiga and gaia toy/card
  ore ni
i hope the next series has a science patrol/attack team again theyre sorely missed in r/b
  who dis
    who dat
  
  we meant the guy next to 80
if cosmos actor was traded for a rider actor who would he get swapped with
      motoki fukamiaizen makoto desu with facial hair
  either hiroshi fujioka or original amazon actor
  what if he got traded for ryukis actor
oh dear  
    tsuburayas wife was catholic  also explains why ultraman crosses his forearms together to shoot his beam
besides the original gridman are there any tokusatsu i should watch if i want to get more out of ssssgridman and get into toku in general     i asked this in the gridman thread thats already up and a kind anon directed me here
  depends on what you are looking for bruh   if you want to understand all the reference its gonna be kind of a tall order since akanes room is filling with monster spawning from the entire franchise  if you want more high school drama the only show kinda like that is ginga season 1 but i personally cant recommend that in good conscience  if you want more monster rassling any of the series can do i would go with tiga dyna and gaia  alternatively you can try the ssss american show
  ill reiterate here and say id recommend tiga max or mebius to start id say go for max but thats just me x is good if you like the combiner aspect of gridman due to the amount of armors he gets
  i figured understanding all the references would take years of work so im not going to worry about that i do plan on watching ssss at some point should i prioritize it as much as the original  if you want more high school drama the only show kinda like that is ginga season 1 but i personally cant recommend that in good conscience  i kinda did but im more than fine with just monster rassling whats wrong with ginga      thanks why are you hesitant to recommend max
the new ultraman netflix trailer 
starts in april
    honestly the models arent half bad but the animation itself looks like its fucking sub 30 fps
    have they announced the voice cast yet
  director kenji kamiyama x shinji aramaki  music nobuko toda x kazuma jinnouchi  studio production ig x sola digital arts    ryouhei kimura  takuya eguchi  megumi han  tanaka hideyuki
  megumi han  not surprised she loves ultraman especially tiga
    eguchi is gonna be moroboshi eh im a bit let down
  thanks why are you hesitant to recommend max  im not hesitant at all i was meaning to point out max and say these three are the usual gotos when recommending ultraman but i prefer max because its just so good
  im a fucking idiot my bad
since were doing recommendations here do we have an updated chart ive had this one for 2 years
  will there be english dub in outside japan netflix
  someone needs to update heisei ultraseven stuff since one member of tvnihon subber is now subbing pre2002 heisei ultraseven episodes recently only 1994 and 1998 series are completely subbed  
  all the new generation stuff should really be at the top of the list at least orb geed ruebe
  it doesnt look as worse as i was expecting but i dont know why theyre still doing the 24fps as a way to emulate anime thing    its looks weird in 3dcg and its a strange creative choice in this project in particular considering they used mocap as way to make fluid movements
has 80 appeared in the manga yet
  i think its only up until taro yet
  leo and astra already in  also windom
  most likely since netflix does a lot of dubs
so until what point of the manga do yall think this anime is gonna cover
  tanaka hideyuki  gonna be weird as fuck having zoffy voice hayata
  whats leos backstory in the manga
  i think he and astra were ace killers gunforhires until they were arrested and imprisoned    he and apparently yullian will appear very soon  so do mebius and hikari
  jack not being highlighted as important  nexus being one of the recommended series to start with  jesus wept
  oh shit so the plot is m78 after all      considering the role hayata plays in the manga its fitting
  why only the universally good shows should be there as starter points nexus is up there because hes an entirely different flavor too many people dislike geed and rube to recommend them as starters
    also this was made before orb
  too many people dislike geed  only you geed is great and loved by many
  im not saying i dont like it in my eyes it wasnt that great a show but im okay with it i actually finished that one instead of quitting early like i did for lube
which is the best place to watch gaia
  get yourself an external harddrive and watch the bds sub quality is alright  
  i did but the quality improvement isnt that noticeable quite a bit of a hassle to stream mkv so i dont want to anymore
  if youre gonna be this stubborn about streaming a poor choice really then go to dailymotion youtube or kissasian the first 2 might have it the last one probably has it but you really should just download it
  i mean i dont watch tv on my desktop getting the blu ray files across to other devices hasnt gone smoothly
  why does godzilla vs kong get a science patrol but ultraman r/b doesnt
  aint a proper science patrol til i see if their handguns can make the kaiju recoil at least by a fraction
  are they just gonna be doing m78 inspired stuff
whatever happened to that max english dub toku made and aired once
  its airing on tokus streaming service it wasnt made my toku it was dubbed in hk around when the show first came out its fairly good i think
  human sized ultraman    yikes
  every thread until you like it
  if nuultraman was human sized for few minutes in whole series that obviously wouldnt be a problem
  a few minutes as a gag  vs  the entire series and it being a major plot point
so i just watched origin saga let me see if i got it right  gai is not host for an ultra  hes actually an ultraman himself  but he wasnt born an ultraman like the ultras from m78  he got turned into an ultra by getting the orbcalibur from the ring of light on the warriors mountain on planet o50  is this right or am i missing something
  hes a completely separate type of alien that through the ring of light achieved a new stage of evolution see an ultra form tiga also had the same basic idea that creatures could aspire to becoming beings of light
  uh i see i could never tell if tiga was just daigo transformed or if tiga was a separate personality using daigo as a host  i guess the theme of normal creatures evolving into beings of light is really recurrent because i remember in mebius mirai saying that the m78 ultras themselves used to be normal humanlike aliens until the radiation of the plasma spark mutated them into ultras
aliens
  whats this for
  tiga is definitely a separate being from daigo since he got camillas panties all tied up in a bunch way back when
  i still havent seen odyssey but i knew that tiga was a guy on his own back then i just couldnt tell if when daigo transformed it was still just him but as a ultraman or if tiga himself assumed the control and did the fighting for him
worldwide new announcement event
      complaining about this now  the mangas been out for fucking seven years and has been licensed for three where have yall been
  
    heh it even looks like great is wearing a cheap spandex body in this figure
it sounds like anime hayata has zoffys voice actor
  the mangas been out for fucking seven years and has been licensed for three where have yall been  trying to pretend it doesnt exist but i cant do that now
  its not really a typical ultraman story or very ultraman at all despite the obvious plot ties theyre dudes in mech suits not aliens for the most part
  well boohoo for you
  its not a bad comic its just not that ultramanish and the connections feel a little strained
  its actually fairly popular hideo ishiguro and hirotaka adachi are fans from what ive heard of
  its just not that ultramanish and the connections feel a little strained  thats what makes it bad why even call it an ultraman manga if its not ultraman
why does gai have a japanese name if hes an alien
a spinoff is needed
is it worth watching ultraseven if i didnt really care for the original ultraman series
  yes
  its a huge improvement in almost every way
  cool ill give it a shot
  because it is an ultraman
      the real thing i cant understand is who is in control when cosmos and musashi fight together they are shown as seperate individuals probably more than any other ultra and human pair cosmos can even manifest on his own    nexus is shown as a seperate individual but the dunamists transforming seem to actually be examples of humans achieving ultra forms that look like nexus faust and mephisto seem to be similar but more of a permanent arrangement in their case made it sound like they dont even count as human anymore
  yeah theyre similar in many respects i love both but there are also some deep differences theres a good chance youll like it more
  itll be getting released soon   i heard the tada fellas got ahold of it
  cosmos and musashi seem to be like what daichi and x would be in the future in that theyre both distinct individuals and the ultra part of the equation can even manifest on his own at least when they have a body but when its time to throw down the human and the ultra work together as a single individual  nexus i have no fucking idea how he works most of the time it seems that its just the dunamist transformed but its clear that nexus is also a character on his own that even communicates with his hosts on occasion generally through dreams or with telepathy     he picked it up after seeing a crimson sunset kurenai get it in one of that chapters of orb saga that only exist as side material
  oh and now i remembered that while he was still the next nexus talked to his host to explain how if they kept going there was a good chance of maki dying and then after the one is destroyed to thank him for helping  so it seems that nexus is actually there with the dunamists all the time but he is a handsoff type of guy that prefers to let his hosts decide how to fight on their own
i love this guy  
    tsuburaya convention 2019 lads
so do we know where dyna came from has he been confirmed to be from the same race of ancient giants as tiga
so /m/ how do we get the last five episodes of ultra q dark fantasy subbed
anyone has the ultraman vs jackal short film  the one on yt is pretty barbage in quality and has shitty watermark
  hayata sssp
  what does it even mean
  goes back to leo
i really want to fuck pega
  i didnt even know she was pega
  they really need to bring justice back
  i hope she continues voicing characters in the franchise
  oh yeah cool

  i am conflicted from what kind of new actress they would get
  uh i see i could never tell if tiga was just daigo transformed or if tiga was a separate personality using daigo as a host    tiga along with some other classic ultraman series kind of treat it as both/and    daigo fights both as an ultra and as a human and for most ultraman protagonists its the ability to weigh both sides of the equation  to wield tremendous cosmic power without losing sight of the small relationships and connections that define their human life  that allows them to really come through and save the day against all odds
so if i want to get into ultraman should i go back and watch the original or should i watch one of the newer ones
  you can watch one of the newer ones but give ultra q pic related or ultraman a shot and definitely try ultraseven because its great fun
pegas vinyl is completely painted for reasons unknown to mortal man
  ultraman piss
  why the hell is that footage so clear and in color where was this when i watched ultra q
  so this is the power of being a mascot
  why the hell is that footage so clear and in color where was this when i watched ultra q  ultra q was colorized so long ago even i cant remember maybe 15 years ago
    no donshine vinyl
    im happy rikus back for the movie he really grew on me
    holy shit this guys really a bdsm freak isnt he
    why does the last upgrade look less impressive than the yellow ruebe
  the progression seems weird you figure it would be primarily red  blue when they first fused then maybe become gold when they power up
im getting a cat soon and i want to name him after an ultrabrother which one should i pick    im thinking zoffy because hes my favorite
  leo
  ultra nyan
  fucking trailer when      why is tsuruno there is he gonna be in the movie
  most likely just a tokyo comiccon thing gaia and agul were apparenly also there
  asuka looking /fa/bulous
    the theme song will be performed by him so thats why
  getting some ginga victory vibes from grb
  i vouch for ace
so how many episodes behind are we
    looks like it takes place one year after the end of r/b
  so wait what was that trailer for that had zero meet the brothers and they make fun of his cat ears
  youre gonna be there right guys
new 
which one do you prefer
nukeboi of course
  based zeon poster
  for sure my thick lad   although theyre both great
gp01 i never really liked how gp02 is only equipped with a beam sabre i guess it doesnt need anything else when its got a fucking nuke but they could at least give it a rifle or something   gp03all
  based
why gp04 so unloved
beam bazooka  nuke  mlrs    while no nuke the beam bazooka is still powerful enough to rival the mega particle cannon  the nukes cool and extremely devastating but its brought down by the fact its a oneshot weapon and youre basically useless once youve used it not to mention that nukes arent easy to produce or acquire  i honestly dont know who thought mlrs was a good idea
  if theres one thing that mobile suits typically dont have its missile pods and racks especially the rear or shoulder mounted kind its uncommon enough that its nice to see that some kind of implementation    whats wrong with the mlrs anyway it frees up the hands to hold other weapons like the beam bazooka you like so much
  the bazooka and mlrs cant be stored simultaneously unfortunately
  just use a beam rifle nerd
  gp03
i liked them all but the gp02 is still my favorite gundam of all time i do wish there was some fanmade combination of all four suits though a gp02 full burnern that can dock into a modified dendrobium orchis      it was only side material fluff and never onscreen besides the gerbera tetra still neat though
  this  them shoulder thrusters
  has one of the most memorable faces in the franchise imo
  hes a bit thick for my liking but i guess hes alright
gonna take you right into the danger zone
  ive got a burning heart
whats up with everyone smashing shit and running away in this show
  i forgot about this
  delaz fleet cant afford prolonged engagements or risk losing mobile suits you hit it hopefully stun it for a few moments and retreat its not a bad method when youre low on resources
  solomon i have returned
          here we go again was it a projectile or a casaba howitzer
  casaba howitzer a minovsky particle infused/impregnated one at that
  can a good hearted anon please tell me what book these come from i always wondered and never could find anything and i am just tired of wondering amazon links or something please
    this
  he looks so short
  at least it got a model kit the gp05 didnt get shit
  for some reason i hadnt seen this kit before but its now in my top 3
  can i have both of them at the same time
  its a good unit in gg i think it has a beam sniper rifle or something
  i honestly dont know who thought mlrs was a good idea  because they look cool as fuck
  why fire one nuke when you can fire 6
  mlrs is not armed with nuclear warheads those are just large missiles for bombardment or antiship use all depictions of mlrs show it firing conventional warheads              and before anyone says lol vidya games not canon keep in mind that the gp02 mlrs version was created as part of the 2006 harmony of gundam variations line specifically for video games    
  you can easily refit them with nukes
  sure but then it wouldnt be canon itd be like saying gms have nuclear weapons because their bazookas could in theory fire nuclear warheads if the federation ever decided to manufacture 380mm shells with nuclear warheads
boy it sure is a good peaceful day on the moonbase to stare at my mecha and not have to worry about keeping the fucking earthers and oneill cylinders from going to war
  if only they knew that we neoneozeon are going to attack the colony for our evil plan its so evil im pissing myself
    pew pew
not so fast evil doers
    mc ii killed him
oh no the blob empire from jupiter is attacking our moon base
  god dammit can you people stop fighting each other for five minutes why does the moonrace have to put a stop to this shit
  i will stop them
capn capn a buncha robots appeared outta nowhere in a colony whats more were being attacked from the outside by a force aligned with the blob empire what da we do what da we do
  oh no our glorious superweapon cauliflower was detonated in my home station
  oh no i couldnt get back in time they destroyed my hometown
  lets shoot that colony down before it and the giant cauliflower lands
   if it werent for the cylinders and the earth i would have been able to protect them
  long live neo neo geo zeon
    badass people with claws have come to save the day
  theyve raised their banner over the colony
  it got shot down by the notgundam
uh oh a new challender steps in the ring
  tee hee
  what the fuck does that text say
bump
no i wont pilot the latest suit with prototype armor plating and weapons and targeting system this war brings nothing but death i see now how we are just numbers in a computer sent to deliver devastation and i wont be a part of it we build these huge machines under the excuse of peace but all they have brought us is losing the ones close to us and making us carry scars of pain and loss we will never heal from
  well damn bitch i dont like this war either but you dont see me sitting on my ass and crying about it
i cant wait to be a useless piece of shit all day and battle the mc while having absolutely no impact on the overall plot also my robot is the spikiest shit ever and probably red/black too
zako zako i think im in the wrong show
  haha get rekt 4channelers i am toom hiroshima
  hi rivalkun im going off to mope on the dark side of the moon see you later
bump
we have a heavy weapon variant ready to go with battleship cannons replacing the arms and legs that have their energy output tied directly into the suits upgraded generator
  oh no its sentient and evil what have we created
  better dust off the second unit which is also sentient but not evil
the battleships are creating a portal and summoning a scary beast
  looks like its time to use that
  fshooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooom
  beyond the smoke and the rubble the evil machine rises
  okay this is epic
  nnoits not possiblenooooooooooo
  haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
jajaja hello i come now jajaja
with our updated grunt we will dominate the earthsphere
we have these on occasion right feel free to share art youve done i guess or request ill start if any of you feel like drawing a police themed power armor or power armor that looks like it transforms into a car thatd be cool and i mean i want wheels and sirens on this baby idk how to access previous deliveries so this is it
  alright requesting these robots celebrating that they finally have english subs in their entirety
  alright requesting these robots celebrating that they finally have english subs in their entirety  dont forget pic related gango finished up the translation back in june
  random /m/tan and related stuff from design variants old standard new one eight chan one no armour/naked to related other characters that ive rarely seen drawn
page 10    sounds like a /m/ draw thread alright       god bless discotek
  neat nice to see more boardtan oc
so how badly did i do on this one /m/
  thank you for reminding me to get off my ass and finally design /m/utt one of these days
  sharpen your pencil draw bigger get some decent paper dont press down so hard
damnit im always too busy with other shit to participate in these hopefully ill find some time for this one
fast sketch inspired by dunbine
  any weaknesses are made up for by the quality robutt
trying to design transforming mecha girls after staring at my transformers all day    its not too easy to come up with good ones i need to clean up my fucking sketch lines
i did a few /m/ things last month for inktober lets see
  hot
    well shit not sure why its flipping on me
    not exactly /m/ but its a terminator so i guess it counts last one
  terminator is definitely /m/
  if i take that off would you die      terminator happens to be exactly /m/ i think it even has giant m too
    youre welcome here added a couple other characters and blurbs explaining each thing    i hope youll not be bothered by the addition of 8ch stuff i was basically the only drawfag in that board and did most of it myself so id rather it not go unused and carry those designs with me wherever i go
  lol forgot file
donut steel for a parallelworld ww2ish setting
  eh pretty good like the size and the scopedog influences in this one
  like that i want to go to something like that for my robuts sensible size more utilitarian look posible weapons and lots of weird influences learning to draw right now tough
  oh right maam and miss    nah the thing was that once wed gotten the now classic /m/tan designed and made his /m/azinguy rival who was partly due to that mazinger shitposter those design threads were really petering out but just before they did there was a notion of needing a girl character    then this one fag kept posting new threads on it for a while with a bunch of components for a new character and a kinda awful doodle begging for someone to draw her too iirc the idea was that /m/aam is a western pirate thats imitating /m/tan the way the west ripped off and sometimes bastardized japanese stuff that version of her is the cleanedup version the original drawfag for /m/tan finall took pity and did    /m/iss is basically just an alternate someone else threw in around the time that finally happened she was just kind of /m/tans maid basically an ed209tan that got machinegun jubblies     imo she looks villainous enough and having a girl villain to two girl heroes is a good ratio
    i was always under the impression it was more a /tv/ thing given its western origins but i suppose robots be robots
  nice any more lore you wanna dump i seem to have missed all this back then i thought i started lurking /m/ earlier but seems it mustve been 2012 at most either that or i happened to miss threads about this
something i did while my internet was out so i was just kinda screwing around with random colors
i tried drawing some moon gundam since i normally do rounded super robots        this sounds like fun ill get to doing some linework tonight before prepping thanksgiving
  oh is that a jesta they look the same as jegans dont they looks pretty good
  yeah its a jesta i do a few other things but i dont really share normally kinda just draw them for myself then save them and never look at them again
could someone draw a robot girl version of rotf ransack please
thread bump
  we talk about shit like battletech and transformers here frequently not to mention things that are tangentially /m/ like giant monsters space warfare people in rubber suits and door hinges
not a robot mostly but i got this request filled out for a living dead oc i used on a gundam game with friends
          animator reporting in    i absolutely love your poses bro very fucking nice you should try animating sometime i think youd exceed at it gitting gud at posing is one of the hardest things to do and you seem to be a natural
    very much appreciated i cant say im a natural though a lot of these used references like actual toys or else took several itetations to get right but thats still very encouraging and i thank you for the positivity cheers
    this is really cool breaks the typical mold for snakethemed designs got any more
  im easily distracted so not really have a gob in pa instead
bump
requesting a halflife themed exaid
  oh uh that first one is me different person from the rest
  lets start a fucking kamen rider draw thread lets see how many /m/peeps could draw kamen riders
does no drawfag here draw mecha musume here is vidar musume i drew    just request it on this thread so it will be alive
  fuck forgot pic here it is
    i got you senpai
might as well
    aw yes sick take well done
a toku hero and his robot sidekick
  ah yes the cockroach themed rider kamen rider roach surely the kids will love him great art though keep it up
bump
  not the best in terms of executionbut your design decisions are absolutely topnotch
could i request yuuki tsubasa/wingle mecha musume
ive been dabbling in drawing character designs for a couple months now and want to start designing mechas can any veterans give me any tips on how its done
  whats the aesthetic youre going for    in your place id just do studies on a bunch of mecha i like to analise how theyre constructed and what i like about them
  80s anime aesthetic ive seen gunbuster and loved it what would you recommend watching
  is that motherufcking mothman
  depends my tastes in mecha design skew heavily towards stuff like big o tetsujin 28 either the 60s or 2004 show gunbuster diebuster giant robo overall either pleasantly retro or weird bold kind of organic shapes ive no idea if thats your vibe maybe you prefer the boxier more stereotypical real robo look so youd want to check braves shows gundam etc or maybe you prefer weird super robo that takes the stuff i mentioned but pushes it into further weird so getter robo or mazinger or maybe you prefer 80sesque real robo and youll want mospeada megazone orguss macross its down to your tastes
  ah thanks for the list i will definitely look into a lot of these animes specifically macross i wanted to do something similar with the mechas transforming into ships
    tbh mecha musu is sort of entry level since you can skip on mechanical detail because the end result will always just be a cute girl wearing metal bits nice vidar tho
  nice
  thanks brah
  kondo approves
  why does nude ver look like greedo
i cant contribute anything to this thread but i like it  have a bump
tried playing around with some designs
hey /m/ im a lurker on tg thats undertaken a goal to design a very fun simple and tactical mech rpg tabeltop game     im not gonna go into the actual system itself the general concept is built around the fusing and combining of individual mechs into a single large mech for highly climatic battles     i can post about the setting in detail but the basis is that there are thousands of individual teams of mech pilots who attend larger base mechs     my questions are    what vital mechanics/concepts should i include to capture a true mecha feel  what cliches are out there that are to be avoided  do you want to know more about the setting/system
  im not sure but i think its mekton zeta that does this its where your average mech is 100 times better than a pilot like if your average human has 10 health then the average mech has 1000 and if the avearge handgun does 16 damage then an average mech blaster does 100600 that way most mech attacks vs humans are a one shot kills and humans would need special weapons to take on a mech it also makes mech combat artificially more extreme cause 600 damage sounds cooler than 6 also make hit tables for diffrent parts of the mech include limbs like arms and legs and take away attacks or abilities depending on where an enemy hits like a taking the head off an enemy makes it so they dont have a video feed of the combat and have to rely on sensors alone or maybe they hit an coolant tank and the pilot has to eject before a certain amount of turns or burn to death
you dont know anything about robot anime so you cant create a true mecha feel
  ive seen a number of /tg/ threads like this on /m/ the people making these games never get back to us    well in case youre any different    just do whatever in terms of concepts whatevers most interesting there is no law that says that you have to stick to this type of convention or even a single type of setting have magic powered steampunk rock golems exist alongside sentient metal aliens and tacticool military tin cans with paper for armor just make sure theyre all viable and dont go overboard with statting out every type of mechanic like mekton does let the players imagination do the work not the rules    if youre doing combining mecha dont do large teams that cant be adequately characterized watch some shows by yoshiyuki tomino and strive to avoid creating characters with lines that are in any way similar to the dialogue of tomino shows try to encourage creative application of finishing moves     thats all i got
  thanks anon     as far as my own ideas so far ive been trying to keep a fairly grounded tone the main conflict has arisen from a debris cloud comprised of millions of high speed particles zooming around earths atmosphere orbit     travel through this cloud almost always leads to the destruction of the vessel moving through it but there are seven massive magnetic spheres that repel the debris in the encompassing area around the magnet these are called lanterns and each is owned and controlled by a specific family    life on earth is tough overpopulated cities and continents only fill up more and more with almost every person on earth dreaming of space travel this mentality is inforced and capitalized on by the families as they employ several mech teams for various reasons on top of actual kept retainers all families will also hire freelance mech teams known as hedgeknights
  the two things ive never seen an /m/ tabletop do are encourage you to have a lot of different attacks instead of just one and in some way make you save your finishing move for the end instead of using it right away for the latter you could try tying finishers to a super gauge like in a fighting game for the former maybe tie experience gain or super meter gain or the like to how many different moves you use in one combat just do something to make it so youre pushed to do more than just make one gun that does everything and do nothing but spam that forever like in mekton
  op ill help you out what you do with this is up to you    vital mechanics/concepts    keep them different there is no true checklist when it comes to these kinds of things but general rule of thumb keep squads small and avoid having more than 6 pilots outside of ultralarge/advanced one of a kind stuff if combinations are the main motif youre going for then teamwork has to be a factor you also need to choose whether you want super robots heroic mecha real robots military mecha or a combo of both    cliches to be avoided    unless youre including lethal joke characters or civilians in the war machines dont use fat guys or mask wearers without them being very high ranking/skilled otherwise it makes the faction much less professional and disciplined unless they have extremely high intellect avoid teens/children in the cockpits    more about the system/setting    political affiliations ideologies histories resources and geography are all important conventional military vehicles like jets choppers tanks armored transports etc need to at least get a mention insetting 70s super robot shows usually have some sort of jet vehicle that is used as an assistant vehicle for the main mecha much like how infantry are used to assist tanks for support keep measurements reasonable so it seems more grounded and easier to get into having a variety of firearms projectiles and other sorts of weapons can flesh things out      hope this all helps
is the macross delta movie worth a watch after having just finished the anime what kind of the new content does the movie offer in comparison to the show
    did you like walkure    yes then its worth a watch    no then skip it since its basically walkure the movie    if you were ambivalent them its probably worth a shot since its only a movie
  did you like walkure  i feel like more couldve been done with them but overall yes i do like them guess i will watch it then thanks anon
  its alright so if you liked delta and walkure then yeah its worth a shot also if you didnt know a sequel film to delta has been announced it may or may not be a sequel to the movie so may as well watch it anyway
do you like the seigfried or draken  if you do the movie is pretty good
  do you value your time    no watch it    yes dont watch it since its a bastardized version of deltas first halt the halt that was legitimately good
  the movie switch the order of some stuff and add new music i think its enjoyable
i want to fingerfuck reina
  why reina
  a sequel film to delta has been announced  well shit ive been out of the macross loop when did this happen
  at the same time they announced the crossover concert
well theyre making a lot of money with the concerts and the record sales a new movie makes sense
  why finger
  the halt that was legitimately good  first half was just a shittier version of f  it was shallow and boring  second half was bad as well but that doesnt make first 13 eps good
  dont they also have a gatchagame and figma that are still making money
  gatchagame  nani
  first half was just a shittier version of f  i can tell youve never watched either shows
  yeah anon its been out for a while now    
  sure although maybe give it a bit of time rather than rushing straight into it    movie is a redo of the story that mostly omits everything from the second half more walkure less windy jerks       a consequence of it redoing only the first half is that it also removes episodes 1314 one of my favorite parts of the series
  removes episodes 1314  oof yeah itll probably be a good idea to hold off on the film for a bit to let some time pass between watching the anime and movie
  as long as walkure remains popular theyll probably still be making delta content
  i didnt even know a crossover concert was announced been really out of the loop ever since the delta tv anime ended
  walkure live shows sell tickets pretty damn fast from what i heard so i think theyll be popular for a while
hey /vg/ might be better for this but im more concerned about the mechs you guys looking forward to mechwarrior 5
  i hadnt heard it was announced but i am now even the crappy mechwarrior games tend to be at least kind of fun
  yeah im just worried that hardpoints and wizkidz bs is going to wreck the story battletech it was great in the 80s and 90s because of the worldbuilding
  you guys looking forward to mechwarrior 5  looks alright i doubt it will be as good as mw2 mercs or mw3 i hope this can rejuvenate the mech sim genre because i want more
  not at all    the main problem comes from the developers who if i say so myself are incompetant and in denial not to shit on the grunts working there the individual coders and artists are a great bunch however the leadership has its head up its own ass and doesnt gave a good understanding of the game balance and dynamics of online that they plan to port as the base of 5 not only are weapons systems implemented innaccurately much more than previous titles they tweak their implementations based off of assumptions that only make sense under a more accurate interpretation of said mechanics eg lrms tube efficiency collant flush basic manouverability mg cones of fire and much more it would be fine if they had any sense of humility or hindsight or flexibility but they dont you are wrong and they are right even when their ceo is openly lying to the faces of his customers while calling people who have dropped 600usd cheapskates live    if this wasnt enough shoddy management and pantshead time constraints have led to asinine practices such as game information being encapuslated in excel file pyramids labelled as xml what inexperience and lazyness have led pgi to forget how to bake decals how to parent surfaces how to align collision meshes to lod/tessalation adjustments how to align collision meshes within any proximity of the actual map collisions gravity render targets world detail clipping prevention and so much more    forget your concerns about the world lore tabletop/mechwarrior accuracy or tradition you will be getting a buggy ugly mess that brings machines to their knees on launch and little to no improvement from then onwards    i really really want to have hope for this game but 5 years of experience with pgis corperate structure and leadership have killed all of it
  plus the last time pgi announced mw5 it turned into the moneysucking mwo
as for the mecha youre recieving visuals wise you should be in good hands the art team at pgi is generally fantastic and goes to great lengths to homage the originals in their reinterpretations though the modellers are sometimes off model    as for mechs youre getting slow lumbering overscaled behemoths with inflated hardpoint counts usually energy      fun fact its been 7 years since pgi promised a cw implementation what early supporters were paying for and it still doesnt exist as described
why is the mad cat such a good looking mech
  because its hybridized with zentradi technology
pgi is incompetent as hell i want to wait and see how close it is to lore theres no point in buying it if the only difference from mwo is youre playing against bots
reading between the lines mechwarrior 5 is gonna be different from what we are used to i think bracket builds are going to be a big deal russ and crew seem to be chasing that traditional battlemech feel we had from the old games hence the stock mode world champ and the desire for a longer time to kill these ideas are not bad and will translate over to the joystick shooter that mechwarrior was always meant to be
  joystick shooter that mechwarrior was always meant to be  it pisses me off how true this is i wonder if well ever get a true battletech action game
  if anything this should warn you to stay far far away because russ doesnt understand how to decrease time to kill and didnt understand how fundamentally stupid unbalanced and boring stock mode world champ was just look at how the changes meant to address both turned out and how much in denial he was when confronted with that information      living legends
  living legends  do you know how populated the servers are
  living legends  i tried living legends and didnt really like it its even less of a battletech game than mwo is at least in terms of agility it had combined arms though so that was pretty neat
  i have my reasons to be hesitant but everything ive seen so far except for the ai is really good and playing like that with my friends is what ive been waiting for from a mecha game for years now    assuming they continue on the path theyre on now and release it in ten months ill probably buy it
  i know all to well    but living legends mechs are much less manouverable than in mwo even after the skill tree blanket mobility nerf just confused where youre coming from
    looks pretty good to me
  ok im a believer
  pilot can barely aim  enemy ai hardly any better  checks out
  while ive been waiting for a mw5 since forever i cant say i have too much faith in the ability of pirahna games    adopting a wait and see approach
  doesnt gave a good understanding of the game balance and dynamics of online that they plan to port as the base of 5  mw5 will be mainly singleplayer i am definitely not a fan of the paytowin grindfest that is mwo but by eliminating the paytowin grindfest you have a quite good game
the thing that makes me the most sad is that  i know this is sacrilege battletech is one of the only mecha interpretations of its type i keep trying to find mecha anime and its always just a bunch of half baked philosophical robots that could be any size due to how they have the same weight as a boxing anime if not less i knew that the current devs for mechwarrior games were lackluster but after seeing whats going on in the board and watching the game footage i find that the make or break for the game is the progression    after playing battletech i was so immensely disappointed as someone who was raised on stories of my fathers mercenary company that his gamemaster calculated salvage for down to actuators and viable endosteel tonnage that game became a kick in the dick the second i decided to customize my mechs    fucking wotc and their money making bullshit
  a bloo bloo bloo some spergs stories about some other spergs house rules arent as good as toy commercials  go cry into a dougram jump some more and know you never played battletech if you dont know how stupid bullshit that really got on tabletop
  i misread that as piranha bytes and now i want a janky gothic/mechwarrior combination
  so this is basically one of the older mechwarrior titles brought up to the present because that should make everyone here pretty happy
      also that clip makes it painfully obvious theyre jist using a shoddy combination of node maps with the ai used for mechwarrior online aka the thing that gets the escort target permanently stuck on a 3 foot speed bump as of current      to put it simply the balance problems dont stem from their payment model the balance as they envision is completely fucked no matter what mech or weapons you use because what pgi thinks their weapon implementations accomplish is the complete opposite of how they actually work    and as the trailers heat values seem to demonstrate many of the weapons in their unbalanced state are being transferred into mw5 not that it matters when the ai is brain dead      in theory
  broad appeal and a resurgence of mecha here we come
    we can only hope
    at least its getting quite a lot of press coverage
  you can walk straight through buildings  neat but it looks kinda weird like all the buildings even the big ones were made of cardboard
i realize this is battletech so ugly mechs are a given but is this really the best they can do for a cover
  hail to the king baby
  the featured mech should be much closer in view and seen at a lower angle to better represent the scale
  represent the scale  the infantryman with the rocket launcher in the foreground does a great job of that
  looks promising ill probably pick it up and play with my brothers and relive mechwarrior 4 lan party glories    
  fmv intros and cutscenes now rare replaced by soulless 3dcg  fuck this timeline
    if you dont know how stupid bullshit that really got on tabletop  this
  why is it that everyone in these mw5 videos play like absolute trash
  does a great job of that  he really doesnt the perspective is kinda bland and flawed so he looks taller compared to the king crab than he should be when you want the opposite effect to be occurring he really could be any scale at all compared to the mech and wed have little way to know    if you want to use a human for scale draw it closer up to him with the mech towering over him or something or at least give us a continuous view of the ground from his feat to the robot
  theyre either games journos or pgi employees and both are borderline retarded and universally terrible at games
so /m/ how are mobile suits classified i made this list gathering info from some boxes like how the rick dias one says aeug mass prouction type attack use mobile suit flavour texts and comparing stats  but its severly lacking specially when trying to figure out the role of stuff like the zeta derivatives regz zet pluses delta whatever rezel and bawoo and i cant seem to get unicorn  it is    genpurpose  zaku ii line  gm  nemo  jeggan  geara doga  assault light armor  drac  gazacd  gazzown  heavy assault  dom  rick dias  gustav karl  hiperformance specially attack and when compared with contemporary suits  rick dom  gm sniper  doven wolf  zaku iii  gustav karl  hispeed  zeta  bawoo  ams119r welter doga  himov  gouf  gallusj  artillery  guncannon  guncannon detector  guntank  zssa  loto  very specialized role ie scorting  jesta  amx117l gazl  the r one  amx117lg gazl grau  the r one  loto    and thats leaving aside prototypes and weird shit like the qubeley most gundams the methuss or the zeong
you forgot about transformable mobile suits
  well not even anaheim knew what they did the titan suits for if anything the gm quell and barzam fall into the hiperformance category by accident maybe the gabthley too
  high speed could be interceptor due to speed and firepower mixed with good durability
  those should immediately go into the trash
  loto wasnt really artillery not enough firepower  it was for quick insertion of troops like an ifv full of soldiers
  not enough firepower  i mean look at is hands an shoulders sure they use it for other stuff
  kek it has to be  fodder  nearly everything  jobber  everything labeled high performance  actually does shit  the ones at the bottom you were too lazy to list
besides all those side materials and whatever when is this info relevant
id really wish theres a better redesigned rx 782 that isnt the same okawara shit and make it more futuristic maybe even have the reboot takes place far in the future like in logh or votoms or something like that idk
id really wish theres a better redesigned rx 782 that isnt the same okawara shit and make it more futuristic  done
  bruh i got some good shit to sell you    
  completely trashed by a girl with a name issue and a trash  never be piloted by amuro ray    why the mkii has such a terrible fate
  still technically okawara shit kill yourself but theres 0 gundam which is arguably the best 00 design since most of the others are kinda bad
    the rx782 and one year war wouldnt make much sense in a far future without changing them beyond the superficial design        the base strike is basically an updated rx782 too
  never be piloted by amuro ray  explain this then
  why does it matter the dijeh had better specs than the mkii
  this is your more futuristic redesigned rx782 say something nice about it
isnt that the point of basically every new gundam design from the zeta to the alex nonokawara designers changing it up and making it more futuristic
  id really wish theres a better redesigned rx 782 that isnt the same okawara shit
  in a similar vein theres the funky rx782 from that later evolve short
  but the metal armours were all designed by okawara
  posts an okawara design
they should make gundam but its a completely different show in a completely different setting by completely different people
an interstellar gundam would be a nice change of pace
  dynames 00 exia kyrios overflag and tieren are bad   ok fine they are a minority
  the eyes
  is there a certain tag for images like this
  imminent_rape
  the strike actually hems a bit closer to the 178 besides duel is the 78 clone of the g project family and even then none of them are as explicit a 78 clone as the impulse
  duel is the 78 clone  nah its a v2 clone assault shroud is even simplified assault buster mode
  assault shroud is clearly an homage to the full armor gundam ya dingus
  p bandai shit face
  thanks
  gfirst
  ewwww
  sp turna also the victorys could do interstellar not to mention quanta also stargazer
  looks like the zeta killed the zz and is wearing its hide as clothing i like it
looks like mecha is going to be saved  fuck gridman
new garland transformation
garland sin bottom and garland zero battleship
the girl is pretty cute
i fucking love part 1 still waiting for updates on the remake sin since nothing came out not even that 5 min long pilot even if it was for xi
    if it ever comes out
cant wait for this to be trash
    but gridman is awesome im looking forward to more megazone regardless
  thats a goofy hair
is there any reason why they wouldnt do this
    the same reason producers would refuse anything else lack of perceived interest
its embarrassing
  /thread
  reminder according to this series duo marries hilde so he can steal her money then leaves her do you really want this
  seriously theyre probably the sanest couple in the series then this shit happens
i feel like if it gets an anime a lot of the crazier shit will get fixed
  thats not what happens she marries duo he inherits a church only to find out the church is lousy with debt which puts her in debt as well she demands a divorce and duo leaves and promises to help her pay off the debt someday    they get back together in the end
  after the spit in the face that nt was this looks like a god sentmasterpiece
  wing without any crazy shit wouldnt be wing
  frozen teardrop was just a set of ideas that sumisawa was experimenting but not intending to use for an anime which is different from gundam unicorn where the light novel from the very beginning was made to be eventually animated    if there actually was an anime continuation to gundam wing he would have some material already to repurpose or redo but wouldnt be doing a straight adaptation
  wheres the part where he gets into an accident and she has to pay off the hospital
  mobile suits including the gundams were never seen again
  and he also becomes president of mars or something
  the unicorn anime isnt really a 11 adaptations of the novels though the basic story remains the same but everything is shuffled around or altered or sometimes outright cut
  happened before that she left him back on earth and duo left for mars where after a time he was hospitalized after a motorcycle accident trowa helps him out and she reunites with him afterward he then becomes a bounty hunter or something i think and leaves for the martian wilderness for a year      actually hilde inherits the church and she divorces duo because of his already outstanding debts from his hospitalization
  case in point  those are the very first lines of the frozen teardrop picture drama lifted word for word    
  and gundam nt isnt
    didnt she died later on trying to find a cure for his rapid aging cause by the nanomachines son and he literally becomes mel gibson in mad max beyond thunderdome    also his kid ends up with zechs and noins daughter
  no to all of that she doesnt die and their son doesnt end up with zechs and noins daughter she and duo get back together the kids could have ended up together but the ending is so rushed that it stopped developing the new cast
  aww poor baby
32th anniversary yesterday its time the saviour of earth be humbly honored by a floof thread    also iczer1 is great
  dangerously close to burning her hair with the lightsaber iczer safely
  man i wish i had a hat full of smol girls like that
  tremendous lack of floof
  it that the wings of mayonnaise guy about to grab her but
  would keiyuri be better if they were tiny
  iczer1 killed hitler  iczer1 confirmed hitler
  the suicide was a coverup  nazi shitters were clinically unable to admit that the dude whose cock they sucked for 12 years was offed by a lesbian with funny ears
i have a weird dejavu of posting on /m/ some argument that proves that cthulhu and iczer1 are space jews actually  i wonder what the thesis was
  very simple the drills with a floofy streimel on top
  safety is a priority
  dyke and asian  somebodys pride got bedemmed there    omg its true
  is baikanfu flipping the bird      oh come on iczer1 im sure nagisa and we would be more pleased if you use just one swimsuitor none
  furufuru
  makes me wonder where is nagisas left hand touching the holy spandex of dykism  or could she be placed on the overwear
  thirtytwoth anniversary
  twoth sounds like something that goes well with floof  i blame work
like nagisa and iczer kissed lovingly with their twoth lips

  gotta keep them the same size relative to each other for important practical purposes
there was an audio drama crossover with dangaiou
  forgot to post related pic
    they look so tasty i could just eat them if mughi doesnt get to them first that is
    fucking hell i want this to be translated so bad    theres so many interesting audio dramas that well never get to enjoy
has anyone put together the definitive list of floof kindof like the list of /m/
    the torrent for the iczer audio dramas on nyaa is currently seeded btw
  i just noticed vampire princess miyu in the middle i dont think she is considered floof
  vpm confirmed cthulhu  i think she is look how volumerific her hime cut is
  oh wait now i see it never mind
what do you expect from 1987 hirano anyway
i wonder what to imagine under mens iczer1
space lesbodyke android explains how to work out and stuff
  very interesting
  you have physical copies what are they anyway
  im afraid thats just a pic pulled from twitter as the filename suggest
got to redownload all these at original size too fuck twitter and web 20
how do you do fellow /m/ posters
  yes moar aika
gets a little bit too fetishistic though the aika sort of humor thats what i see it as works well in moderation and with the pantsu throughput pacing the anime has
  
gotta slap  
why does it seem older anime always gets a pass and isnt as harshly scrutinized as newer anime dangaioh is garbage but that is considered a classic venus wars is pretty boring for the second half but its well liked as well
its possible no idea if the nostalgic feeling helps or the difference from current style of things i just like the look of the ink and cel art not exclusively but its just nice  i can like nicely drawn digital stuff too but it lacks some of the feel
  nostalgia to be quite honest i havent really seen anyone praising dangaiohs story or characters it is always character and mechanical designs and its art and animation
  its craftsmanship versus consumption basically process for making newer anime is more streamlined efficient computerized stories are tilted towards selfgratification and eating up as much as you can older anime do have their flaws sometimes went offmodel and were poorly plotted but due to the old process there is always a level of craftsmanship that newer stuff doesnt have
  no but have the sister image thats at least tangentially related
  because dangaioh and venus wars look good and newer anime doesnt look good
  stainless night  damn right    i wonder if dirty pair shouldnt be included though i mean thats like mothers of yuri goggles /m/related shipping
  it does get scrutinized just as fairly there is just less to scrutinize because the shows are better
  moozi2   not even once i swear if the fucker would stop removing the fucking film grain from his releases his shit would be great but nope
iczers drills are no match for motokos side tufts
  well maybe if those two floofheads didnt rub up against each other we wouldnt be so prone to imagine them scissoring super hard
  cant even shoot beams electricity or laserblades from her fist also motoko isnt cute when getting hurt
reminds me that it seems that iczer1 has really long nails on right hand probably sharp and used as weapon
but not so on the left hand
   yes she is
not bad but iczer1 just has better personality for this role its the va too i love how yamamoto yuriko does her    1980s were less concerned with being badass and edgy i guess that helps a lot too
  nonsense 1980s were all about being badass and edgy
  iczer1 as a character isnt just listen to how emotional and tender she gets  iczerone battle music collectiondisc 110 iczer 1 no narration  nagisamp3
  ssssslut
  izcerone was never edgy hell her voice always exuded kindness
there are people so deluded and blinded by nostalgia they actually say the 1980s werent concerned with being badass and edgy
izcer1 and her sister izcer3
  well look at the ova realistically  they would not write iczer as such a straightgood and benevolent and softycaring personality because they would be afraid that kiddos will laugh and call her goodytwo shoes/selfrighteous/moralfag/etc idiot that is oh so annoying and i want to kill her end so on cringe  back then the influence of the evil is more cool mentality wasnt as strong yet so accordingly you were able to have the heroes be more straightforwardly heroic    today you gotta do complex antihero get dark and stuff if that was in demand in 1980s too it was less ubiquitous and to lesser extent thats what i meant
  iczer1 that is naturally iczer2 is edgy as fuck but the point is she is also obviously evil violent and fucked bitch and a negative element in the story  later such qualities started to be imported or emulated in heroes too to make them more cool thats where stuff gets edgy in bad sense if villain is evil and cruel thats ok thats the natural state of things
  jesus fuck anon take off the rose glasses
  so can you give me some counter examples from today
  you for some reason think the 80s werent obsessed with edgy and badass thats beyond delusional
nanoha being fairly upbeat and fluffy story where people are nice comes to mind but then you have threads about it full of people that demand that the writers should kill half the characters to make it great again
  not that anon but that fact of yours doesnt mean shit when we are talking about iczcerone because both heroines were good people and the edgy characters were all villains
  shes a space sukeban
            okay heres the thing    you never said iczer1 isnt concerned with being edgy and badass you specifically said      1980s were less concerned with being badass and edgy  which is undeniably false   and you also said  today you gotta do complex antihero get dark and stuff if that was in demand in 1980s too it was less ubiquitous and to lesser extent  which is even more bullshit the 1980s were the decade of loosecannon rogue cops psychopathic war vets shady operators antiestablishment troublemakers drifters and badass delinquents in comics in movies in manga and in anime it was the industry standard for actionoriented stories almost everywhere    whats happening is that youre trying to come up with a reason why iczer1 herself isnt super edgy despite almost every other aspect of the ova being super edgy but the reason you came up with is bullshit
  this  and this  were my only posts the only thing i ever argued with you or whoever started this shit was that izcerone the character wasnt edgy whatever other bullshit you and other anons were discussing is irrelevant to my point
          was the point of this series to make me die from chronic masturbation because im about to
    post the dude one too    on that note why is mecha stuff so gay/lesbian
  shes pure evil in the first ova becomes a sukeban detective during bouken iczer3
  izcer3 was so meh it bothers me because it had more episodes than the others entries and still manages to feel incomplete and aimless
awwwwwwww
  those beautiful lines
  very highcut i see
  very floofy in both the right places too
  blah the only right place is the scalp
you still arent into 1980s truly if you still dont like pubic hair young flooffadan
  female crotches should be supersmooth ideally with no genitals
guess what where
  chompy hamster teeth right in my face
both canonically hairy    carol saved humanity has pointy ears and is pretty much noticzer1 only the most despicable of ungrateful dirty slobs would dis her pubes
seeing another chance to accomplish his ambition shapiro quickly aboard the space ship base he had decided to join the cthulhu  to show his determination he sing his song      what will sir violet cobaltsepia and iczer2think of this man 
  very handsome and talented
  someone shrunk down lina
  mhh
  is to heart porn /m/ its /m/anabe
why cant they be happy
  fucking this
ikuzawan
im kinda dying to know what goes on there
oh cute afterword there was a chibi nagisa talking with the mangaka about ero dangaioh dj ideas tpp but nsfw
  smol iczer best iczer
  why is nagisa such a sloot
  oh who is that leotard lady
  nagisa i dont think you saw what iczer2 did also all the lewds were initiated by iczer1 by the look of it  
awwwwwww
  shes still a floof sloot
  what did you just say about iczer1s partner bitch
oh wait picked wrong nagisa there
iczer1 did a lot of things to teenage mes special places
  it feels like nova was a iczer character that accidentally went on the set of an fantasy series
  ive been told on here that iczer and the rayearth tv adaptation had the same character designer or something    okay just looked it up they both have oobari masami as a common denominator i have a feeling he had something to do with the inclusion of nova
  toshihiro hirano was also in rayearth so he was likely the culprit
  my sexy homicidal maniac cant possibly be this cute
  very nice
  cobalt probably isnt particularly evil or bloodthirsty look at her interactions with sepia who remembers her as so kind or gentle or something like that iirc in ep2  her laughing villian act is probably just an effect of the typical narrative cliches you know how even chracters that turn out to be good and noble first look edgy as fuck cutthroats when the shounen protagonist first meets them so that there is more drama one of the flaws of anime/manga storytelling is that it sacrifices consistency for shortterm effect like this
  sepia is absolutely biased though you could be a monster in your everyday life and still being a kind partner to your lover to be fair i think it is implied that cobalt and the cthulhu considered humans to be insects or something alike thanks for that one big gold
  yeah its probably stuff like that plus that narrative mannerism factor
  you know i kind of wish mia was in iczer 1 or zeorymer somehow she is my favorite hirano girl  but i do kind of feel like dangaioh isnt quite up there with his best stuff
well i could imagine iczer2 ripping the spandex and pantyhose off her
  imagine iczer2 ripping the spandex and pantyhose off her    did she let reddas and blueba help her and join the fun or she had her all the by herself   they brothers had been so loyal to her they should have some reward
  iczer1 totalled them
  if you can recreate the human form with machinery breeding becomes superfluous deep down every /m/an and wo/m/an knows this
  facts
to be quite honest tho iczer3 is the most fun and floofiest and her ova was the dopest too but all of this shouldnt have come to an end 
dat va though
  never understood the reason to hire a female wrestler to voice her regardless of popularity
  so shall we start another floof thread or unleash the smol floofy gall force here
  if there are enough image slots left you might as well unleash the smol
  i was waiting for there to be another so we could go full force besides this is a iczer dedicated thread
  but if you insist here they come
little rumy is smol even if big  i think i never caught what is her terminatorsetting name
the helmet girl the true zen of floof
        thats the best version of rumy of course
big little gall force
        whew so i must have forgotten this but the va is the same as   omg
  headpattenings    by the way whats the name of the 90s gall force again
  
  wake up floofball
  die worms nobody but kono iczer2 is allowed to wake up the pathetic oneedyke
  not so fast heres another torsorobo with lesbian superpowers
  but that one wont get its hips back if she waits
  im sure she would have hadnt it been for nakamuras meddling she would probably have gotten her political asylum and everything    and then spend 45 years in robojail for her crimes
i wonder what would happen if somebody smashed the tub would iczer1 be able to levitate since iczer1 can apparently stand in the air or would she fall on the floor and somebody would have to carry her away lets say the other nice bits grow back anyway eventually for scientific reasons
  iczer2 bust be able to levitate
  i figure she could levitate but itd be funny to see her flop around on the floor
nasty humour but to be desu i was really glad when she came from the dead in the bouken ova and remained alive  now she just has to be reformed by the benevolent influence of space lesbianism
  uh oh
never watched this before is it any good if so should i watch the whole series or does it get bad at a certain point
  its dumb but its neat watch it
  iczer1 is great but it does show the usual flaws everything in the 1970s and the 1980s had shitty script and random jumps in characterization iczer3 is more lighthearted and even more dumb even though it has more episodes i didnt like iczellion at all so i wont talk about it
post priss
  look at this dumb purissubot
  desu  youre fucking kidding me right they didnt add the word  honest  to the filter did they
    okay they didnt  ive been got
  wow
  id like to see more of the face but its looking like obaris gotten better at people
so this is supposedly in magical girl emi no idea which episode sadly  
kinda like this iczers in the other one but i forgot which series/episode that was
  uh oh
  since when did rem started hanging out with goliath
  its the dream demon rapist from ep1s first part
  yeah i know also did rem dye her hair brown to look natural and yes i am aware its from another show
the iczers have changed colors too maybe its to keep it from being exactly copied
  is it a new drawing/painting i saw he tweeted it i think
smol bump
remaster of iczer3 probably never
i wonder if devil hunter yohko will ever get remastered the first ep looked much better on the us release but rest was crap
  daaz5pvumaexpsgjpg  hoho nice somebody wanted a hiranostyle yui in the part ii slutpants theres supposed to be a nipple slip though    just one thing you might already know but if you append orig to the filename in the twitter picture url you can get higherres version took me years before i found out damn
  iczer 1 is pretty much the goat anime when it comes to fuzzy 80s light effects
  im going to watch some non sjw pc correct shows from the 80s i will through this on the pile
i think i mentioned this pic in one of the past threads bt could not find it  rem walks into a hamburger place and gods daughters from twinkle heart are serving
  ffast
  thats the manga
is there some complete collections of the dirty pair callendars or does somebody have it hoarded privatelly and want to dump/upload
i really want to post the urushihara porn pic of them now
natsuki in heat
  based
speaking of clamp dykemom iczers and daughteru iczer  did iczer1 knock up iczer2 or the other way around or is iczer3 just magitech that grew in a vat
about 60 floof by volume
i want you to post girls  valkyries  no numacross shit please lets do ourselves a favour and stop at macross 7
has anyone collected this series of images that featured this meltrandi girl alongside her human lover and various vfs and destroids itd be nice if someone could dump them
  is is macross that started the idea of plaster idols on planes i know of pickup girls on wwii planes but the big images like the idolmaster skins for ace combat are coming from there
  probably
  ok
  this girl and her custom regular is just the cutest combo ever
thanks for the dump i wonder if its possible to piece together some kind of narrative from this series the main girl and her boyriend seems to have met during the first space war
  stop at worst macross  for what purpose
eat shit and die faggot
seeing humans and zentradi broing around after sw1 just makes me super happy whenever it comes up
  frontiers the one where the waists of the battroids are so thin they have to be held in place with magical sparkly magnetism while they transform isnt it
  he didnt say to stop at delta
  what valkyrie is this the sms logos make me think vf25 but it looks different
why does she keep popping out of the regult why isnt she wearing any actual armor instead of a skintight suit in the middle of combat in macross her head would get sniped in seconds and her body bombarded with missiles just as fast trash image set
  its a 25 with a tornado pack
  who are these chars ive only watched macross and a bit of 7
  oc donut steels    i dont think macross has ever concerned itself with practical body armor for the giant alien cuties
  what i always wondered is a how was this even attached in a loadbearing way and b what was the control mechanism
  armor   in macross  when fucking 35mm autocannons can shred a vfs energy conversion armor which is at least as tough as tank armor if not better
  maybe her skinsuit has some usb 30 ports for the fast packs
  are musumes of valkyries allowed
are valkyries allowed
  valkyries were never black fuck marvel
  whos that on the right
   whoever wields mjolnir is thor   thor has been a woman and an orange space alien   quibble about black valkyries
  lets do ourselves a favour and stop at macross 7  but 7 is the worst by far
     magic super aliens with advanced tech that can dissect space and time   why arent they just like norse mythology
  valkyries were never black  how many of them have you met
  i guess this wasnt a great thread or anything but you still didnt have to ruin it
what was the universal century like before the dawn of the universal century
  overpopulation  pollution  wars  nothing has truly changed
  basically a fucked up earth without colonies or ms or atleast i for what i remember
  overpopulation wars due to race religion culture and resources and a shit ton of pollution at some point there was a massive world war called the unification war i think that led to the earth federation being founded and the start of space colonization
episode in 11 hours
if digits it will suck
  slayed
  yes
if dubs akane  reborn digifer is confirmed
    based
    okay mr bateman you seems happy today
  im just happy my theory has the blessed backing of dubs
  it can be done if the toy design has a knee joint under the extending thigh armor
so today is dream episode  god zenon right
  its already 12 where
this is pretty underwhelming
  you didnt watch it though
its kinda redundant to say in a ultra anime but dear god im in awe at the size of this lad
  i did watch eps 1 through 8 it is nothing special
  ah fair enough its a fun ride for me so far i like it but i admit that the show is nothing special so far that is weve got 4 more episodes to go and possibly a second season since the show is doing well last time i heard
just jumping to this thread and say that i finished the original gridman i liked it the way they took down kahndigifer was cool as fuck but something for the rest of the episode feels that it could have been better not sure what it is yet maybe it needed more buildup in the past episodes i expected more plot focused stuff after takeshi and takeos episode in any case i had a blast also pic related was best kaiju hands down  im plan to go through ssss gridman now and im about to download the available episodes and the old anime expo short and i realized that there are some audio dramas as well how important are those to the plot or are extras
  i realized that there are some audio dramas as well how important are those to the plot or are extras    theres a blog thats translated all the audio drama released up to this point theres nothing important about them just some comedy stuff    but they did clarify a couple details  1 the neon genesis junior high schoolers arent actually called that its a title they chose in tribute of junior high school students who saved the world at the turn of the 21st century could be referring to either evangelion or og gridman the former is far more likely what with the name    2 they are hyper agents just like gridman ie probably not human but theyre very very familiar with human society meaning theyve probably been living among humans for quite a while
      batemans on a roll today huh
  could be referring to either evangelion or og gridman the former is far more likely what with the name  they are actually called shinsekai which means new century  and eva takes place in 2015
  oh hey neat transformer
  they can also act as previews as some stuff gets foreshadowed in them
  no bitch thats my knee
    where the fuck are you watching it
  this is actually cute
  
i watched 3 episodes before i realized ssss meant superhuman samurai syber squad now i need to go back to my parents house and find my toys this is the best thing ever
  neat eyes  the head is still comically big for the suit though
theres one particular shot in todays episode where yuta running to gridman is really reminds to this shot    someone who got the raw already screenshot the scene please
  that faceplate reminds me of a gundam
  kidou choujin griddam
  baby dan dan  baby dan dan  moeagare
someone has picture with anosillus2 and redman i saw it in thread for episode 6
quality
  i dont think ive seen a manda reference in an anime in my entire life before  mad      kidooooooo choooojin  gridodamuuuuuuu  dan dandan
  you know youre not as wrong as youd think
    mfw gridman designs used to be good
  and it was a coproduction with takara influencing the mechanical see toy designs right
mongolian throat singing  turn a turn  turn a turn  turn aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  powered zenon  
  audio drama is up  tl when
tfw lose again
  its proportioned like a toddler
  is that the dream episode  i like that they didnt recognise takeshi even though all he did to disguise himself was a tiny eyemask really drives home how little attention they pay to him
    whats with all the redman x gridman stuff is it a nip meme
tfw lose again
missed the program again
  redman is just a general ultra meme in japan
she will win yuta rikka and utsumis friendship at the end
  meant for  
  hello star saber
lets combine  
  reminds me of gogov
utsumi couldve been akanes savior if they actually talked
its up
i still prefer god compared to powered but whatever good to know that this kaiju is a punching bag in terms of strength
wew lad this is just suffering
seriously just stop
  i love anti and his increasing levels of autism
rikka will try create some plan for busting akane out of her dream but judging by the fact anti switches sides in next episode it will fail and endanger rikka herself
i like how even as a fuckhuge sword calibur still has stuttering problems
top 10 pictures taken before degeneracy
noclip on
  no kidding this seriously looks like the face of victory mars
i really like this part
akane not having to fall asleep to participate in the dream was a nice touch
shes the villain  why the fuck do i feel this pain
  same  it looked really nice
kaiju wasnt harming anything it would clip right through buildings  its only purpose was keeping the three in a dream  only became tangible after the three broke out  akane made the kaiju with the sole purpose of not wanting them to leave her alone
    gridman alliance are running from right to left breaking away from their dreams and awakening  akane runs on the opposite direction and delves deeper into her delusions  pretty good
she just wants a boyfriend and true friends she can hang out with  alexis exploited the shit out of her
i cant believe it this part made my boner harder than god zenon
  a boyfriend and true friends  i dunno she also invited utsumi to come to her house with implications and you can argue that she was going somewhere with rikka in the same place too    then again shes definitely fucked up in the head so her perception of friendship might be also distorted but she explicitly said that she and yuta were going out during the dream sequence so either she actually likes him which i doubt or shes just plain out manipulative
  i need this with audio now
  she is living a dream where she is the heroine notice that she sits behind the protagonist desk in her classroom and everyone are the npcs with designated roles yuta sits right near her which is usually the designated mcs romantic interest spot im not saying that the segment with utsumi had no lewd implications but they were considerably toned down compared to yuta serving as her actual boyfriend while utsumi calls her a friend    though in the end she is too autistic to actually connect even with the npcs created to be a part of her story
10/10 episode the best one in the show so far
  from how i interpret it i think she just wants to experience being normal like if she has a proper control of her life  having a friend that she could hang out with having someone that she could share her hobby with and being in a relationship
  after reading that one post in /a/ yeah i actually agree with you im now inclined to believe that theres not much implications with utsumi and rikka since the former is just the designated tokufagfriend and the latter would be her bestfriend    at first i was confused with akane and her character with this episode but its clearer to me now that she really is just socially inept who just wanted a normal life with normal relationships pic related the dream sequences were her ideal scenarios i understand more why shes breaking down in this episode since despite making these npcs with tailored personalities it still doesnt go well and even putting those said npcs in a dream state still doesnt do jackshit
  oh hey its terranoid
  yep thats why king gridman is a brave
  it is nothing special  no u
  do a flip
no joking this might be one of my favorite anime of the decade if they dont fuck up the ending  i was not expecting this soft sequel to a cult toku show from the 90s that got additional projects cancelled to be this good
  i love how this fucker walks especially at the episode when it was sadly destroyed the zoom at gridmans face while god zenon was just passing by was priceless
  same here honestly its been a long time since ive looked forward to a new episode every week
jumbo saber slash  can we just stop for a moment and appreciate those impressive layers of autism
left or right
  right i love walking bricks
  left right has no elbow action  its still pretty fucking awesome though
  left still love right though
  its just been so long since we had a cool super robot show ik mazinger z infinity came out but thats a movie the guys at trigger really have passion for this sometimes a little too much but its all good in the end
  right if i have to choose bricks id choose an actual brick
  left looks cooler although i appreciate right for having an axe
  this episode upset me so much there were two ultra act king gridmans on mandarake for 5500 yen and when i got money today they were sold out so all whole utsumi waa in mandarake thats all i could think about      im kind of joking though this episode seriously struck a nerve with me im a pretty big agoraphobic neet autist arent there hundreds of thousands of hikkimoris in japan
  wait a minute if you buy two of these then you can make a mecha shiva just put the extra jet legs on the drills of powered gridman
  wait guys theres one for 7000 which is 81 cad should i buy it
  whole episode nothing but quality  then this shot  at least they know how to spend their budget
  you dont know what quality is
  do you consider masaaki yuasas works quality anon
  no bully anti best boy second to gridman himself of course gridman bestest boy      because youre a hwaifufag    i gotta say this was an excellent episode the best so far and the shows actually got me sitting on the edge of my seat for the next episode    girlgetscuckoldedbyalienrobotandcommonhumandecencyandisforcedtolearnthatyoucantforcepeopleintorelationshipswithyouandindulgingyourselfinadreamwillultimatelybringyoumisery the episode    now id love to see a doujin of an alternative take on this episode where gridman breaks into the dream dates rikka becomes best bros with utsumi and yuta while making sure akane watches all of it just to rub the friendship/lovecucking in
well now this makes more sense  i came here just for giant robot fights not to feel goddamnit
  something went wrong heres the pic
yfw when he dumps your autistic ass for his alien robot bro  these protagonists are ultrabased
yuta runs near the small fence that doesnt obscure his view  utsumi runs near a bigger fence but it still doesnt obscure his view  rikka runs near a stone wall
  truly a real /m/an
  sheeet rikka is the weaklink isnt she shes the one whos gonna buckle when they finally get to put akane in her place
  ouch no matter how many times she tries to kill herself she could never die maybe the whole goddess complex but she thinks the only one that can kill her would be gridman not sure about wanting her own creations to kill herself though
  yuta is 100 /ourguy/ even more than utsumi
  its more about her fake friendship with akane still obscuring her way i presume but she works around that at least  i fully expect her to try something to reconcile with akane but it will backfire so badly anti will join gridman to defend her
  even more than utsumi
  were reaching levels of storyboarding that shouldnt even be possible for a toku show
  all that running  this lyric in the ed  why do i somehow feel like running i hate running it feels like shit but this anime is making me think its enjoyable and make me want to run as fast as i can against the wind
those industrial sounds in the beginning of episode creating an unsettling atmosphere  holy fucking shit amemiya where you were hiding your talent
  i remember back when the gridman ultra acts were released people were criticizing them for being floppy looking at them now thunder and king gridman are the cheapest to get in scalper zones like ebay and searching a bit more it made me realize why those two are fucking armors on a gridman figure those types of figures arent very good to pose since the parts can pop off easily doesnt help that the ultra act line in general is also criticized for loose parts  keep in mind that if you want to get it  i wonder if base gridman suffers that same fate same for god zenon
  dont get me wrong utsumis still /ourguy/ but as soon as yuta heard his alien bro tell him to begone the thot mayne instantly runs whereas utsumi for the faintest second thinks about it
  based
  can you really say no to this body
i would legit abandon autismo pussy if my alien brah calls me to fulfil my oshigoto together    alienbrah superior autisticpuss inferior
  can you believe this anime is directed by the same guy that gave us this  but credit where credit is due kai ikarashi was both the episode director and storyboarder for ep9 so all the praise in the world for a job well done
  you think she really tried to kill herself i took that as just not bothering to use the stairs v
  filename  thats wrong everyone just uses megidoloan instead
  kai ikarashi was both the episode director  no kaneko yoshiyuki was the episode director  ikarashi was
  that file name  not in nocturne it is or god forbid dds demifiend
this show is fucking incredible
god zenon doesnt have his chad walk  i feel cheated
at this rate gridman is gonna surpass inferno cop as my favourite trigger show and i fucking love inferno cop
  its chad stride you uncultured swine
the atmosphere of this episode reminded me of the black faust shit in ultraman nexus
  dreams are made to wake up from anon
  dreams are something to wake up from  i fucking loved that line who knew yuta was so wise    im loving this show so much right now      in your face specialfag watch episode 9
  all the dreaminess this episode made me want to see david lynch direct a super robot shoe or tokusatsu just imagine the kaiju itd be like a permanent dream episode
    actually those industrial sounds reminded me a lot of davis lynch i wonder if it was intentional or not either way it was excellent sound design    also very silent hill 2 especially with all the fog but that was inspired by lynch anyways i love this shit super robot shoes usually have great sound effects because of all the fights and transformations but nothing like this
  watch episode 9  its been amazing since like episode 2 if you cant tell this show is incredibly well made and certainly something special you have no sense of direction and atmosphere
watching this for the second time and spotted this not a yurifag but the whole rikka being a lesbo thing is starting to feel more believable    with this scene happening right after and all
  theres not even a tiniest bit of a hint at her being a lesbian fuck off back whatever you came from and leave at least this thread without your autism
    clash of the dubs    also i agree theres theres a total of zero hints at lesbianism you need to cleanse your brain of /a/s yurifagging
  why is a kid whipping his dick out in that poster
  nigga thats a stick dont go around fucking shotas now
  i know asians have small pener but thats just ridiculous
  youre right im sorry
  that torso swivel  i am so hard right now
in that moment it felt like yuta and gridman were one being
  i wonder if the robotic movement is intentional or the suit is genuinely that hard to move in
  its 100 intentional his entire thing is hes the three support units combined and hes controlled with a game controller by the other two kids
does anyone happen to have clean art of any mechanical designs from the original series i want to do stupid edits and recolours
  that double uppercut  savage
  its definitely intentional considering the context and everything surrounding god zenon hell god zenons suit actor moves even more more robotically than sentai mecha suit actors do and they usually have even worse cases pile of cardboard boxes stacked together
  ultra magnus is that you
why is yuta so based
  it seems that being thoroughly based is the prime factor for gridman to pick you as his host
  yuta understands it all and wants to save her from her escapism  utsumi wishes they had met under different   circumstances  rikka rejects the farce  all of them are running the opposite direction from akane and away from the dream  akane wants to keep running towards her escapism but gridman keeps blocking her way  how many layers of kino are you on
  they had met  they had bonded
  remember when undertake was about the same thing and then people just became extremely autistic introverts who couldnt even post about it online without being an annoying dont who couldnt make friends and just jerked off to waifus all day same for evangelion     sometimes otakus are beyond hope
  its not like this show hadnt had its moments of kino but ep 9 laid the kino down so hard    if they maintain this kind of quality for the final 3episode stretch ssssgridman would easily be the best thing trigger has done to this day
  what the hell are you talking about
what if the final battle utilizes the real ssss gridman suit
  then i dont think anything in this decade can surpass gridman
    yfw they use the oxt mix of the original gridman anime
  akane dream is real life  holy shit could the finale actually be live action
  are we gonna meme this into being real
  holy shit could the finale actually be live action  holy fuck youre a genius    i would masturbate viciously if they actually do that holy fuck    this show would easily the best anime weve had in decades if they do it
  i hope so
can we get gridman into the /m/ roster for winter cup  as a matter of fact do we even have any tsuburaya in the roster
so this episode is kino as fuck but it also was helpful in better confirming some shit    the humans really are humans not programs akane can mess with memories and dreams but she cant straight up change people no matter how hard she tries  anti really is becoming a real being it was kinda obvious when he fucking bled from alexis attack but now they just went and said it i wonder if thats just how all good kaiju are a la anoshiras ii and the ssss or if its something unique to anti as part of his whole adaptation power gridman is part human so anti ended up becoming human  akane doesnt just warp places she can fucking fall off a building and land perfectly fine so she really wasnt in any danger in the forest before also shes losing her fucking mind    cant wait for next week we only got pic related left and this creepy fuck just screams akane snaps with his whole kaijuu thats a guy in a suit thing
with how good gridman is right now i wonder how kino will the last fight be
  whole kaijuu thats a guy in a suit thing  kind of reminds me of some of the weirder theories about shin gojira before it came out
  oh so thats the same monster cool
  isnt that the same monster as akanes profile pic
  would be cool if the red one burst out of the other during the fight
  yeah alien baltan
  nah her profile pic is alien reguran from ultraman tiga
  ah this brings back memories
  not burst  theyre gonna beat the shit out of the pink one and the head will come off you can see a seam around the neck and theyll think they beat it only to see the creepy fuck inside it who will then come out of the skin and be fast as fuck and creepy
  someone make a webm of the rebuilt zenon episode 32 maybe something like that taking hits and happily strutting forward like its nothing that scene legitimately made me laugh out loud
  well there is a reason she is always carrying that stanley knife around anon
  someone make a webm of the rebuilt zenon episode 32 maybe something like that taking hits and happily strutting forward like its nothing  im on it
  i am pretty sure ive seen that god zenon pose a billion times post more if you find them
  turns out it was episode 28
  shinsekai which means new century  just an autistic correction thats shinseiki shinsekai would be new world
  god zenon is like 3mb of pure fuck you
  walk into the club like
i was sorta hoping that when zenon is formed the crew become a singular being with a unique voice maybe even do that autistic roar that the original god zenon
  the chad stride
  maybe even do that autistic roar that the original  i was hoping for that too
  does
  the best part is that he opens his offensive sequence not with a punch or kick but a fucking chest bump
  i didnt know autistic people roared is that what you do anon
first thing utsumi does when waking up is realize how sore/raw his shins are    such a nice touch
  its just funny and sad to me how many pieces of fiction end up being about growing up and rejoining society but because they have cool shit go completely over shut in autists heads
  based borr
  thats a giant walking vagina so i think gal might be a more appropriate word to use there
  what were the shin godzilla theories
    i dont think it confirms the people are humans i think its simply a case that akane fled to some virtual world to escape reality as such the protags were various people she created to make herself happy a bff in rikka another ultrafanatic in utsumi and a boyfriend in yuta what we saw in the dream were how they were supposed to be    but then gridman arrived to stop alexis and bonded with yuta in essence it broke yutas programming and he became selfaware but lacking any real backstory he was simply meant to be akanes boyfriend and without that there was nothing else to him no past no family nothing and by getting rikka and utsumi involved it broke them out as well they arent the npcs akane originally created anymore just like how anti isnt just a kaiju
  also fuck me i realized i was projecting so ignore that
  so its like akane wrote a fan fiction and then was rejected by everyone in her own fan fiction ouch
  that does bring into question anocillas 2 thanking yuta not gridman
  that it would open up and have a humanoid creature inside ie the person inside the costume
  nah the world isnt virtual at least not fully its some kind of mixture a virtual blanket over the real world  when anoshiras said theres nothing outside the city there wasnt just a void it was the real planet just totally fucked with rocks floating in the air and shit    something fucked the planet and to protect what they could takeshi and the old gridman crew probably went ahead and did what khan was trying to do at the end of the original gridman they fused the real and virtual worlds  this let kaijuu and gridman exist within the real world and protect the people so the humans are real but the world is virtual    if the humans werent real and were just virtual then theres no reason akane would need the kaijuu to kill them for her she could just delete them or plop them into a pit like she was able to get into yutas room and teleport his air conditioner remote to herself instantly
  and here i thought galaxy mega was the coolest toku mecha
  then gridman arrived to stop alexis and bonded with yuta in essence it broke yutas programming and he became selfaware but lacking any real backstory he was simply meant to be akanes boyfriend and without that there was nothing else to him no past no family nothing    thats not quite right remember in the very first episode gridman tells yuta to remember him their bond meaning theyve actually met before and then theres yuta getting a feeling that he met anosillus the 2nd somewhere before    i think akane is bullshitting with the whole god shtick it seems to only be a halftruth she didnt really create these people in the same sense a god would rather she most likely made a simulation of the real world then warped everyones minds
  how does that explain the picture in his house originally showing his parents
im really happy to see some reference that related to hasegawas past work like this    and today we got two hasegawas big boy
  the other one was terranoid dyna
  or that yuta simply is a part of gridman that exists in the npc shell
  thats highly unlikely desu simply because yuta is completely human while gridman is an energybased being why would a part of gridman be actual flesh and blood    theres also yuta actually having a life before his amnesia he met and bonded with gridman met anosillus the 2nd and was a friendly acquaintance of utsumi a month before the storys beginning     he wasnt manifested of thin air and he doesnt not have a backstory
    parts of this episode dont really match up with it but im sticking to my idea that akane is the one here whos not a real human  shes an ai that is being told its real and a god and all that shit not just any ai though the ai made to keep the city safe using kaijuu the reason she can do all the things shes done and can manipulate the town fully is because its basically an extension of herself  thats why shes so fucked up she doesnt understand what shes doing is actually wrong    the humans are real theyre what the system was built to protect gridman and the ssss arent under her control because theyre a separate system built as security theyre active because akane basically got a virus that being alexis alexis is the one fucking with her perception  hes the one that keeps telling her shes a person and she made this city and she should be able to do what she wants  the dream shes having isnt the city or anything its that shes a real person she has no past she has no parents shes not part of their class shes a rogue program essentially no different from the kaijuu of the original show    and the cherry on top of all this     this kaijuu is going to represent this fact its a kaijuu thats literally a freaky abomination inside a floppy kaijuu suit  thats what akane is shes a program going around in a human form pretending shes something shes not
  akane being a program herself would be a cool idea but i feel like it would undersell the themes/ideas that were setup in the series namely her being an autistic that dont know how to fit in so she makes a virtual world where is a god and forces everyone to love her only for it to backfire and have a resistance group foul her playtime and try to wake her up from this autistic illusion and accept reality
  wake her up from this autistic illusion and accept reality  i do seriously hope we get a redemption for akane like we did with takeshi
im surprised theyve kept tonkawa as such a strong presence through out the show you know for a character the main cast barely interacted with and wasnt friends with
  her death by kaiju and subsequent memoryrewriting done to her family is part of what makes akane a monster theyre not just going to forget about it until its convenient
  she is mostly just a symbol for akanes sociopathy  why would she even take yuta to tonkawas grave
  i think akane is bullshitting with the whole god shtick it seems to only be a halftruth she didnt really create these people in the same sense a god would rather she most likely made a simulation of the real world then warped everyones minds  its more likely the creation of the simulation and the enslaving of humanity to it was all alexis borne out of the loneliness of akane and the feelings that if she could force others to be her friend that everything would be okay
  my guess is that yuta and gridman were defeated by alexisremember that memory yuta had of gridman being impaled that people insisted was an eva referenceat some point in the past and this caused their amnesia    that doesnt explain akanes role in all this my guess is that the world was messed up long before akane went on her power tripalexiss machinations the city in the sky    all we know is that shes alexiss pawn and is not the god that she claims these most recent episodes have shown that shes losing her grip on the simulation
  i dont think akane actually brought him to tonkawas grave it was yutas subconscious remembering what akane has done
    i get that it just surprises me since theyd normally pick a character the cast would be close to    thought thinking about it it works better this way had they done it the classic way the cast would be seeking revenge for the death of their friend and thats not something this show wants to promote
so was the six stars at ep 1 alexis  gridman and the support weapons
  god zenon is like 3mb of pure fuck you  my fucking sides
  utsumi had the most to gain from staying in the dream his only other friend is yuta and he doesnt share the same interests and hobbies as him akane was trying to seduce him at the last minute but the dude really just wanted someone to geek out over toku and mecha shit with
question how come you guys dont mention that the floating cityceiling looks exactly like the computer world from the first gridman show    im sure you didnt miss it so did you already talk about it at length or didnt think it was an important detail
  final fight is gonna be alexis and gridman breaking through the city and it becoming a real live action toku fight on the original set remix of the original theme will play during it too
  weve speculated that it might be the digital world of the original acting as a dome since the outside world is apparently destroyed
    i feel like this is too much to set up for in just 3 three episodes especially since im getting the feeling that we wont be done with akanes arc until the last second leaving the show no room to focus on alexis and the background of the world and its nature
  since each computer world they went to in the show was different depending on the device thatd make sense that the entire outside world was cut off i just assumed that this current computer world of ssssgridman was akanes computer or something
  since the character songs are releasing before episode 11 i assume 10 is going to be a huge dump of info and will solidify everything except for yutas memory that well get in episode 11 that leaves room for 12 to be one big blow out fight
              
  if they stick with how the toku show went well get akane trying desperately to do something at the beginning of episode 11 getting tossed aside by alexis and getting picked up by yuta and the gang where all four of them go on to beat alexis in the final epsiode which can absolutely work i just dont know what episode 10 would have maybe something with anti
  leaked episode descriptions which have been mostly accurate so far say 10 has someone change sides so yeah probably anti  whatever big thing rikka has to tell the group
  either anti or rikka will change sides for sure    anti i wanna preserve gridman so i can beat his ass later by myself    rikka i wanna be by akanes side so i can convince her to get her shit together    or maybe both      i feel like something important was just said in the 99 voice drama    
    so theres this meme template where i come from  loosely translated for your convenience
it seems like akane had a pleasant nap
  that leg shoop  thanks for the laugh  checked
  could be the same designer tsuyoshi nonaka who designed the support mecha and combinations in the gridman anime worked on super sentai mecha designs too
btw i recommend you all listen to the voice dramas theyre pretty funny    theres an ongoing subplot with rikkas mom being insecure about her age and insisting she ages as gracefully as angelina jolie with her husband being an equivalent of brad pitt
  wheres 99 tl
is anti incapable of transforming if gridmans not around i know his power is copy gridman but that shouldnt affect his transformation    i assumed in past episodes he was just waiting for him to show up but here he clearly wanted to fight a kaiju and doesnt bother to change
  should be on this blog soon      also      c h a r l i z e t h e r o n    anta baba arimasen
  timestamp at 350
  he can only change around gridman or if akane explicitly orders him to
  i think the changing sides thing is almost definitely going to be anti too much setup to be for nothing calibur straight up called him a living person with a heart this episode and he also attacked akanes kaiju anti changing sides is pretty much an open secret at this point the mystery is what rikka has to say but i dont think rikka will change sides whatever she has to say will lead into yutas memory recovery in episode 11 that said i expect to see anti gattai with gridman next episode
  god zenons head is optimus   powered zenons head is star saber    nice
  he said in episode 7 that he cant transform unless gridmans around
  simply because yuta is completely human  presumptuous
  or if akane explicitly orders him to    guess that makes sense i must have forgotten
mfw there wont be any porn of akane as a ganguro styled slut girl controlling the world to be her giant fuckhouse
  that said i expect to see anti gattai with gridman next episode  dyna dragon when    they cant have kept that a secret from us for this long considering all the leaks weve gotten could they
  dyna dragon when  i thought the dream was dead
  yfw anti is the dyna dragon
      its literally what khan was doing in the end of the original gridman they fused the real and virtual world together    thats why gridman and the kaijuu show up in the world and why junk is there  its not a virtual junk its the real junk
i feel like im missing out so much with this show not having seen the original
  your experience would 100 be enhanced if you watched at least some of the original
  even this late in the game
  s literally what khan was doing in the end of the original gridman they fused the real and virtual world together  show me where that happened because that didnt happen
  you really arent any continuity with the original series is vague at this point
  absolutely youd see things and be like oh man no way i was floored when apparently the special dog was a thing in the og show
  well thats what i was implying im just saying if he became dyna dragon and combined with gridman wed probably have seen the concept art for that
  but the references and nods are half the fun
  what the hell is special dog
i feel like akanes character is basically takeshis but moreexplored is that the right word    shell end up atoning for her sins once she breaks out of her isolation like he did
  difference here is that she actually did kill someone  i dunno if theyll actually give her a full redemption after that
  classic redemptionbydeath maybe that seems to be the most likely scenario
  mfw shell be raped by alexis the moment she broke from his spell
  difference here is that she actually did kill someone  are you telling me nobody died in the plane and other vehicle crashes
  anyomore
  difference here is that she actually did kill someone  did she everything except her alexis the ssss and gridman are just digital fabrications
  according to pixiv akane was also sexually harassed by a gay too
another shit episode   the absolute state of this show
  are you really this desperate for yous
  did she everything except her alexis the ssss and gridman are just digital fabrications  no everyone in her world is truly alive this isnt sims she just manipulated them to like her with her powers
    she didnt even manipulate them to like her  all shes able to do to them is rewrite their memories to keep peace in the city    if she had more control over the people she would have used it instead of just killing them via kaijuu
  hes just meming he does the same thing with the same image on the /a/ threads let him be
does /m/ like gridman now i havent seen past episode 1 but i liked it also remember people being really pessimistic to it early i thought a lot had dropped it
  its very very good
  does /m/ like gridman now   the fuck do you mean now even before ssss /m/ always liked the original gridman and /m/ liked the former since its first episode
  personally i am watching it due to nostalgia reason since i watched the original gridman as well as super human samurai as a kid     that being said the animation is top notch and the storyline is decent too
  cant speak for anyone else but i find it somewhat lackluster unlike genuine garbage like planet with there is effort being put into it but its very slow when action is not happening normally id easily blame trigger for this since theyre a shitty studio but i cant ignore that tsubaraya made bio planet woo
  slow pacing and less action is a bad thing
  i fucking love it aoty material for me
  thats what happens when youre raised on a diet of dumb shonenshit like dragon ball and naruto which is all about lightning pace and fast action around the clock
  dragon ball and naruto which is all about lightning pace and fast action around the clock
  it is a bad thing especially in tokusatsu which this tries to emulate
  dragon ball has slow as fuck pacing though
is this the only gran acceptor toy we ever got how rare are these
  if you really want action in your life why are you posting about toku/anime on 4channel alone on a saturday night
  theres a japanese one i just saw one on mandarake but it was expensive and sold out fast i wish i knew where to buy old ssss toys i really loved that green and blue servo repaint
  but its very slow when action is not happening  and yet its still genuinely interesting and engaging during those parts is your attention span really this short
  heres the difference no matter how stupid it sounds or plot convenience nobody was confirm dead here the magic of kids tv show whereas in ssss they explicitly show/confirmed someone died on 2 diff occasion
  fuuuck thats pretty steep i hope they make an ssss one at some point
  this isnt sims  did did you not see the virtual city in the sky
    tfw you will never aksess furash
going into the original gridman with the perception that its a sort of prequel i think is actually making it more neat if anything
  you mean the computer world yeah i did and it means nothing conscious beings can exist within the virtual plane not everyone who isnt a hyper agent or allied with one is a mindless collection of data look at anti look at anosillus    unless you were thinking that i didnt acknowledge that theyre in some sort of digital world in which case i do at least as far as we can tell
  wasnt anti explicitly a mindless collection of data though its his interactions that have made him grow into something else
    i think its actually that the town is both its the real world with a virtual dome over top of it thats why junk and gridman can exist on the same plane here its both worlds overlapping    the world outside this virtual zone is just totally fucked up thats the floating rocks and shit we saw in the end of the river episode thats the nothing outside the city anoshiras ii was talking about
yall should stop explaining things as if we know them as fact already
  maybe theres something weird going on with anti but what about anosillus
  this is possible  interesting too
  anosillus was from outside whatever that means so shes not beholden to the same systems as everyone else
  the original anosillas wasnt created by takeshi it just mysteriously appeared within the computer world on its own
what was the mech akane was playing with in yutas house
are the ahsmb drama subs dead
  the anime maybe the manga doesnt
  so its a digimon
in hibikis dream akane says and does all the things rikka wants to but didnt  in rikkas dream she and akane swap places  in nerds dream its basically the same as when they met before except she isnt trying to phish for info about hibiki so it was nice for both of them
i wonder how antis redemption is going to happen will his kaiju form turn red and be more mecha like dyna dragon im assuming from all those times anti has copied an ability from battling gridman it will all culminate into him being able to combine with gridman for the king gridman equivalent
  anti isnt going to become dyna dragon anime is too short for that
  anime is too short for that  nigga we already got max gridman and powered zenon but we got 3 episodes left  we still have to fight the costume kaijuu and alexis thats plenty of time for them to lose access to the ssss and have anti take their place    anti literally cant stop himself from copying gridmans shit thats why hes become a living creature cause he learned gridman is part yuta so now he too is part living  he probably also copied the ssss ability to fuse with gridman without realizing it thats how well get this shows version of king gridman probably at the end    and when he does finally do it anti will rip off his bandage and show that hes got the same scarring as senketsu as a trigger fanservice bit alexis slashed him vertically across the right eye itll somehow be encorporated into the king gridman maybe on the chest or something
  i doubt hell be called that but it wouldnt surprise me that he could separate and combine with gridman if its in full powered mode and we already saw that anti can keep his copy power up after gridman decombines as we saw in ep 7    so i assume fp gridman gets beat in the last episode then anti combines with him after he reverts to normal gridman
what if he just becomes the dragonic cannon support weapon
  thatd be lame they should go full king gridman with anti and also have powered zenon alongside because theyd be using the same amount of power as fullpower gridman
  i still believe that if king gridman was going to happen wed have seen it leaked so im just thinking smaller scale
  if king gridman was going to happen wed have seen it leaked  im hoping against hope that youre wrong and its just super secret
    have they shown an anti toy    then again if it were to happen anti probably would have some new form as well so there could just be 2 antis one as his regular form and one that fuses with the gridman toy
  probably they avoided using him in the full powered episode and it wouldnt surprise me if he changes appearance he already did it for his flight form
  i really dont think anti as is will combine with gridman at all his current form is a shinobilar reference not dyna dragon hed have to go through junk first and become a support weapon of some kind
  eh theyre probably not gonna combine but anti could still fill the dragon sized hole in the ssss team by fighting alongside them
  plus he kinda hates gridman at most his redemption will be death by sacrifice through a only i am allowed to defeat gridman
  the mystery is what rikka has to say  i thought she was going to tell them about how akane programmed her
goodsmile zenon not too bad better than megahouse at least but thats no surprise
is there something else in the op song that could spoil the ending aside from the seriess overall plot
  maybe whatever this thingy is i have no idea what it is so its probably a spoiler of some kind but does it really count as a spoiler if nobody knows its a spoiler
  theyll be back
  space garlic
amnesia theory   yuta and rikka is already a couple during the pre amnesia state the confession happened way way before episode 1 probably the classroom scene that the voice drama mentioned   girlfriend/boyfriend status is the nail to the coffin to akanes insanity   akane doesnt want to be her friend anymore   yuta and rikka had a fight prior to amnesia about friend over boyfriend shenanigan   yuta went to rikkas house to talk after some time probably called her beforehand telling her that he has something important to say    post amnesia   rikka doesnt want to tell him that hes in a relationship with her because its better this way so as to not overcomplicate things   try to keep distant from him so that akane doesnt get angry any more than she already has   rikka tells him that he sucks if he was pretending to have amnesia because yuta called her to meet that day   she likes him at the same time tries to keep a distance from him due to her loyalty to her best friend
  its the fact that its not someone the main cast was close to that makes it powerful they didnt lose a best friend or family member its just that one of their classmates stopped showing up one less face in the crowd shows they dont need to be close to someone to make taking their life abhorrent
  well whatever happened im sure these two things are definitely involved one would be the six lights in the sky akane saw at the start of the first episode the other would be whatever yuta and rikka talked about in the classroom im sure those two events hold the key to unravelling the mystery of the world who yuta/gridman really is and whats happened to make the world the way it is
  posted this in another thread but it also functions as an ultraseven reference
  damn thats good symbolism i gotta say
finally they meet each other
    kino  i  n  o
sooo no drama this week
  there is but no tl yet i think
  i think that yuta developing a crush on rikka instead of akane would be enough to make akane upset since his designated role is that of her boyfriend
  she took a photo of him when he entered the classroom and thanked rikka that might be something of a clue
  it feels like akane tries to live rikkas life in general but fails miserably even in the controlled virtual world rikka maintains her popularity while akane with her designated protagonist spot is losing time and time again against a guy who shouldve been kind to her  the fact she gave yuta a special dog is pretty interesting seeing how autistic she usually is
  llewd
has anybody noticed how alexis was partially intangible this episode do you think this might have to do with that kaijus powers
  alexis is building himself a citysized superkaiju and can freely materialize inside it
  the last fight is against the entire city  i would nut so hard
whats the surprising thing you like about this series so far
  the most surprising thing for me is calibur being autistic and funny
  this and the rest of the assist weapons i really didnt expect myself being so engrossed by those 4s personalities and quirks
  
    oh shit you might be right no im positive youre right christ dis gun b gud
  they managed to merge a motw show and storydriven show into one without skimping out on things from either im not the most cultured person but its the first time im seeing something like this done
  the former is far more likely what with the name  eva takes place in 2015 og gridman which this is a sequel to takes place in the late 90s
    alexis in the op seems to be enormous too he is like a mountain compared to gridman
  well most people me included thought that was just a reference to the japanese op of transformers animated
      from what ive seen khan digifer also used a similar tactic so thats neat
  have they shown an anti toy  possibly no idea if this is a custom based on a shinobilar toy or not
  nah this has to be a custom  fingers crossed for anti dressing in red and orange next week
tonkawa family restaurant is called dragon emperor  mr tonkawa is dyna dragon confirmed
ive been trying to put my finger on it and failing    what are the running themes of ssss gridman  like the drama and mystery are great and all but whats the underlying meaning to it all what are they trying to say through it    i feel like its gotta be something about what it means to be real but that seems a bit off
  escapism bad sociopathy bad solipsism bad
  killing people is wrong
  shinseki hiro tanjo was the name of denko choujin gridmans first episode funimation dubbing the line neon genesis instead of new century has got to be one of the stupidest translation moves ever
  kaiju must be exterminated
  go live your life and stop making escapism your daily life
pastebin of mega from hardworking anons if anyone can catalog whats in the megas thatd be greatly appreciated      prev 
  the geed primitive design is my favorite ultraman design since the classic showa stuff i wish i liked the character and the show more
how far behind are episode wise on subbed ultraman rb episodes  do we know what happened with the colortimer subs guys
  22s currently airing at the time of writing so were about 5 eps behind
oh no mommy is bad
  fuck off
  no fucking way bad dad make way for scum mum
where is grigio
its really weird adding a character to the opening credits this late into the series
  forgot pic
    it is a pretty major character but yeah theres like 4 episodes left counting this one
  its sucks that crunchy decided to drop ultra now i know there are some people who hate r/b here but personally its so far my favorite new gen show
  no grigio on poster  so is she still a thing or tsubu decided to drop the idea of ultrawomen
yesterday at tokyo comicon
  probably a surprise saved for later dont wanna blow your load all at once
  it looks like someone is missing
  daigos actor is like permabanned from ever playing the character again due to agency bullshit twenty fucking years my friend
  he played him 10 years ago for superior 8 ultra brothers
  oh
  have him resigned there or moved to a safer agency then there will be no problem for him
  look at smap  they are from the same agency
  i think that was meant to be his last hurrah as tiga
dumb question but whats up with all these tweets with gaias actor i think they been doing this for more than two months    
  movie ultraman tiga ultraman dyna ultraman gaia the decisive battle in hyperspace part 1 and 2 are on youtube tsuburaya channel  also novelized version of the movie to be exact 20 years after the event of the movie has been released today  
  are these better versions of the already released figuarts
  i still wonder how many ultraman novels there are that we dont even know about i didnt even know that mebius got a book that revealed how dan got his ultraseven powers back at the end of leo
currently watching orbits my first ultra show what should i watch after this if i really like orb because i really fucking like orb
  after orb you can jump on r/b which is real good as well imo    other that that the ultraman zero movies and then geed or whatever else catches your eye desu
  i think taking a stab at the major wellliked shows is worth doing the original is great ultraseven is great i havent seen tiga yet but its often recommended all of these are different but approachable nexus is maybe the least approachable but its far from impenetrable to new fans if you for whatever reason abhor episodic storytelling and want an ongoing plot you can check out the other newer shows and the zero movies geed in particular is helped by watching the zero movies first the show currently airing r/b has a lot of references to orb so you can comfortably move onto that if you want     up to you or you can just go with whatever sounds cool ultraman has a lot of history and adult fans but its not something that tries to alienate people you can pick up just about any given show and follow it just fine just dont dismiss the older shows without checking them out first ultraman and ultraseven both are wonderful and an obvious place to start i started with the original series and im glad i did
  original ultraman and ultraseven have novelizations the latters heisei ovs recieved that only for the 1999 and evolution with one of them featuring kiriyama being alive instead of being killed off    other than that theres nexus 3 stories collaborated with hayakawa publishing house ultraman sisters mebius genesis and kaiju girls stories
whats the best ultraman op im leaning towards mebius    
  x for me
  nexus ace leo
  orb  geeds not bad  
  oh and the one with pega is pega version
  episode theme  theme
  i like nexus otoko naraaa
  dont forget the novelized parts of orb chronicle
  ooooh apparently keiichi hasegawas the movies original screenwriter is writing it himself between this and ssss gridman its nice to see him working on tsuburaya again
  low key best  
  that revealed how dan got his ultraseven powers  i just started watching ultraseven and was wondering when they were going to go into his origin do they never mention it in the series
  im talking about dans role in ultraman leo since he loses his powers in that show but i think episode 17 of ultraseven goes into detail with his actual origin story
  its episode 16 in some instances because of the banned episode kerfuffle
    managed to watch that episode and it had a pretty scary premise delicious kids blood just a shame about modeling the monster after atomic bomb survivors  its funny because they say the episode was banned because it was in bad taste but reading up on it mentions how those same survivors are discriminated against so it almost feels like japan trying to duck a more shameful part of history and themselves
color timer subs   colorsubs  6m6 minutes ago    hello everybody just a quick update as we know that its been a bit since weve put up completed episodes     we are still working on episodes 1820 its been a busy time for everyone with the holidays and such but rest assured we are still working to get these subs out
  im hoping he gets to write for ultraman again
some tokyo comiccon panel stuff in case anyones interested      
  are we ever going to get neos or ultraseven 21 to appear in one of those gimmicks
  probably never
  on the subject of watching ultra seven are there recommended subs i had a look at some eps by bootlegsubs but i get the feeling theres a lot either wrong or just straight up changed in them
80 suit in manga when
  coming soon
  nah those are the only subs available as far as i know i think bootlegsubs is basically the shout factory release for ultra seven
  shout factory is a bootleg sub anyway since they licensed from chaiyo
  yeah pretty much
  how will would tiga suit work in the manga    or how would orb or geed suit work
  ultras from taro onwards seem to be branching away from the iron man suit concept so they might have to get more creative
  why are leo and astra so smug also why did the scanlations stopped at vol 9
  got licensed  when translations stop for anything it either got licensed or the translators lost interest
  man thats bullshit other series get licensed too but they dont stop
  other series arent as niche as this one and the scanlations actually stopped at around volume three or so     volume four up to nine are the official viz media scans that were posted on /co/ volume ten has been out for months but no one has scanned it yet
  its been an unspoken courtesy thing ever since streaming/simulcasting got big and more stuff has been getting officially licensed go to any sub/scanlation group and youll find out that they have a general hands off policy once something gets licensed where theyll stop all work and start purging what they have its less about supporting the official release and more about covering their asses from legal repercussions
does anyone have the subbed episodes of kaiju club the torrents for it on anidex are gone
yo how much of ultraman should i watch should i just watch the original series or is everything else good too
  seems like the only did three but theyre up here and still seeded heres two megas i grabbed off the wayback machine just in case          
  start with tiga original is too old to enjoy without being a fan of the franchise first
  ultraseven though
how do they decide on which shows get an ultra fight type spinoff zero victory and orb got one but somehow x and geed didnt
  im a big fan of the shows era godzilla films so im assuming the original ultraman series is similar
  showa era damn auto correct
  the tiga suit could have phaseshift armor  and something tells me that well also be getting a tiga suit quite soon as well
  its very similar to the toho sf movies of the time the first three shows ultra q ultraman and ultraseven are must watches
        theyre apparently not ultras but aliens made to look like the original leo and astra for some god awful reason    i wonder if shimizu has even watched an ultraman show
  he has thats the point though its a reimagining of the franchise not an adaptation
  try reading the ultramanga end of volume omake strips
  leo and astra werent from m78 so that might be the reason
its like the publisher had some deal with tsuburaya forty years ago found it in a drawer but because it only covers the name they cant use the actual likeness of any characters from ultraman
  so now we have another sompote sands
  hmmmmmmmm
why is r/b just not clicking for me /m78/ i really dug orb and geed so i dont really have a problem with the toyeticness and tone of the new generation shows but i just cant get into it
  its pretty ironic that the company was able to get a deal with tsuburaya to license leo for streaming years later
  i think they wanted to go in a different direction the more common stuff about ultra shows lack of science team etc and focus on the more human family aspects and thats fine but at the same time im scratching my head over how asahi either consciously/unconsciously inserted herself into their family and when the father rightfully confronts this cuckoo bird of a child everybody starts yelling at him and its resolution is basically well youre not really our sister but we love you anyway     also aizens sudden removal from the entire plot kinda sucked it was probably just wishful thinking on my part that he could be redeemed or learn his lesson but to just put him through the prop shredder like that rang hollow a shame really since to me he was the most interesting character and his actors great
  r/b is boring im at episode 15 yet it feels like nothing big happened
  sudden removal  more like a scheduled removal he has been working on multiple projects during the time of filming
  you have no soul
  original is too old to enjoy without being a fan of the franchise first  i dont think so its the one i started with and loved it its still easily my favorite or one of my favorites
  watch max its a good blend of heisei and showa styled ultra
  yeah aizen felt like wasted potential i didnt like his character that much but i was expecting them to do a lot more with him though i wont be surprised if ultraman tregear from the movie just turned out to be him
    leo ultraseven nexus taro tiga geed in that order    though i feel like the unused theme for return of ultraman is a fucking 1970s banger    
attack team/science patrol next season pls
the monster mom brought back was a demaaga  what did you do x
  i think you need to wait for this thing to happen unless tsupro might be planning to drop it off again for experimental purposes
    thanks thinking of checking out the zero moves next to see what the deal is with belial the wiki says these movies take place within the m78/showa timeline do i need to watch some of the earlier shows before checking out these movies
  do i need to watch some of the earlier shows before checking out these movies  need no theyre great and absolutely worth watching but if you want to watch the zero movies first go ahead
  you should at least watch ultra galaxy and ultra galaxy neo first the zero movies are a sequel to ultra galaxy if you have time you should even watch mebius first especially the gaidens because thats where all the modern space travel stuff started off
  ultraman and leos first intro    that song much ruins the show for me everytime i watch it it just feels so out of place with the content of the episodes
  yeah in like episode 17 or something i was impatient my first watch too still my favourite series though
  is there anywhere to find this banned episode online please anon i own the dvd put out by shout factory but alas its not contained in that release
  the entire showa shows i say
  zoomer detected
  i know its been recreated with a copy of the moonaudio and the video from tnts run of seven pretty sure theres subs too
  here you go the ultraseven banned episode 12     
  careful ive heard that if you watch this episode the memory police will visit you at night and wipe your memory and delete the episode from your hard drive
  you absolute champion thank you so much anon
this maybe a stupid question but is the battle between seven and metron in the targeted town started the charge toward each other and freeze frame thing
    the ultra galaxy legends movie was one of the first ultrarelated things i ever watched and i didnt backtrack to watch the actual mmb series until later its a fine introduction since its like 80 sakamoto wirework and explosions anyways
  i basically did this too but it sorta ruined my expectations of what normal ultraman is all about     i still think the miniature sets and practical effects are cool and all but there is something off about the cosmic powered beings lumbering around like 50 year old wrestlers on earth compared to the highflying action of ultra galaxy legends
when did you grow out of onions teen mecha shows about high school everything postevangelion and start only watching chad ovas
i watch both

  ryo ryusei for the upcoming 5 jokes
q do you hate sea cucumbers  m i do    q how do you feel transforming into decade for the first time in a while  m ah it actually doesnt really feel that way i mean he got a power up and theres no real sense of nostalgia i mean i guess it is nostalgic its more like hes strong lol  d but you did say youve gotten rusty at it right  m yeah ive gotten pretty rusty at the whole transforming thing thats true just a bit
  unironically hates sea cucumbers    eh hell learn
wrapping up kamen rider ryuki shortly it seems like both of its films are worth watching
  episode final is cool but 13 riders is way too rushed because its not just an alternate ending but attempts to retell the entire series
  people can submit subtitles to youtube videos right
  also although episode final is an alternate ending it aired midway through the series so it will be missing most of the elements introduced later
  q when talking about decade narutakis onore decade always comes to mind but are you aware that fans are always quoting that even now have you ever said onore decade yourself   m first off before getting into whether ive heard it or not do you think theres ever a time when i dont hear it for the last ten years ive continued to live as inoue masahiro i cant even count all the narutakis ive met going onore decade at me even when im playing a completely different role i still hear it   d you always hear it no matter what huh  m seriously  d no matter what you do  m seriously   m just how many are there
  only if allowed  but you can load subtitle scripts using chrome extensions probably others browsers too
  iwae
  first off before getting into whether ive heard it or not do you think theres ever a time when i dont hear it for the last ten years ive continued to live as inoue masahiro i cant even count all the narutakis ive met going onore decade at me even when im playing a completely different role i still hear it  damn narutaki is everywhere these days
  have to use an extension  i suppose its an option for people to use if they cant torrent or download episodes for whatever reason but i would really only watch it off youtube on mobile which is probably an even bigger pain in the ass to load subs onto
  wheres a agito ryuki blade hibiki kabuto kiva drive
  its nice how theyre all so heavily inspired by the mosters of their respective shows another deno doesnt look that much like an imagin though and i guess another gaim doesnt look that much like an inves but you can really feel an orphnoch vibe from another faiz a strong greeed vibe from another ooo a zodiarts vibe from another fourze and a bugster vibe from another fourze
  another gaims sword is more similar to the overlord kings sword than gaims
  thats what a kamen rider supposed to look like
a male precure  a female rider    believe in miracle
ready for the chad decade to dab on the virgin zio
reminder that shun nishime is a pure boy and didnt deserve being in a bad show like ghost
  q which rider world would you like to visit most  m well as far as worlds id like to visit go overall theres none in particular but if i had to pick one and ive said this before but the world of precure i mean ive been to plenty of rider worlds already and ive even leapt into the world of sentai but the only world ive never been to is the world of precure nothing but postdub  d laughing the world of precure huh well when you say postdub its actually just voiceacting   m yup    incidentally in an earlier video masahiro said that his favorite part of playing in rider is the postdub
    fucking precure rider did it first
super  hero  time
  i dont mind male cures but i fucking hate henri so i hate it
  was the supposedly canceled heartcatch crossover during decade real or just some bullshit someone made up because id have loved to see that
  did what first
  masahiro is watching precure  
  erika vs the destroyer of worlds
  gay wing form
  iirc the original cure blacks va was in kr black and rx
  that sounds interesting but the fuck was gonna be the plot for that
fucking  decadeagito straight off the bat
attack zio
op started even started  takeru and tsukasa already appear  goddamn this episode is going in strong
  decade passes thru  so this is the world of precure  motw shows up  shenanigans  ffrs marine  tsukasa learns a valuable lesson about the power of love or something  not that hard
  thats a guy
is this mika another ghost
  yeah  but he is quite literally a fag
  dont tell me cause i fucking love that gayass
  name i want to youtube his transformation
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
nice to see they remembered how wool chooses his another riders
gaiz btfo
oh shit its the set from the photos
rip plastic furniture
  someones getting fancy with their typesetting
 tsukasa straight up killed sougo    holy fucking shit
sougo somehow gets a flashback for a scene that he wasnt even present for    what the fuck
another ghost gets crushed by girders   wool gives him the another ghost watch to keep him alive against his will  any time the riders defeat ag the guy will actually die
mini melon dabbing on the haters
  plastic furniture    leave them alone havent they suffered enough
oi you cunts does the new decade driver have the old voice actor for it
  takeru  the most selfish rider   im starting to think that most antighost posters have never watched the show before but only bandwagon off /krg/ memes
  waga maou
  yes
what the fuck did takeru do
sougo is fucking dead
my name is tokiwa sougo past my 18th year of life my soul was stolen by kamen rider ghost to come back to life i used the power of kamen rider zio and started fighting ghost
  show up so he can give sogou the riderwatch of this arc just like every other returning rider
  go back to your shitty ass stream
i cant believe zio was only 13 episodes long
  is that how it works wouldnt the dude just appear in the spot ag gets defeated at thats how another wizard worked
    dont do that anon takeru has done more in his shared arc than any of the rider cameos
geiz jobs to decadeagito twice in the same episode
that fucking decade watch finisher
do they play  or  when decade shows up
comes with dx decade driver  p bandai only
  ive seen it 1 and a half times up until alain turns good its really not that bad not a great show but not too offensive after that though it just goes to shit and thats when the i want to have dinner memes start still i do think the most selfish rider isnt takeru its diend or kaixa if were allowing secondaries and probably tendou if were limited to primaries      i like it
  just eerie silence so far he hasnt showed up in decade form yet though
ghost arc  no onari  yet makoto of all people comes back next episode
  he was moments away from dying under the girders before wool gave him the watch and turned him into ag the watch gave him his life back without the crushed body killing ag and thus making the watch inert returns him to his prewatch state wherever he is   did you even watch the episode

leave the destroyer of worlds to me
  kamen rider zio black armor confirmed
  the dude was being crushed by debrits when received the another ghost watch  hes almost dead
    he was investigating the ghost appearance cases and meets decade helping another ghost he later sees zio and thinks he was the kamen rider helping another ghost and captures him once he undoes the transformation but soon realizes sogo is a good person later when sogo is defeated by decade and has his soul taken by another ghost he uses some mystic technique to allow sogos soul to escape    next episode according to summaries he will fly the time mazine to the past for sogo and also recover his powers somehow
  zio card  zios symbol is nowhere on the driver    though i guess it was necessary to keep the thing from being a complete clusterfuck due to the way its designed there are actually an uneven number of emblems on the upper and lower parts
  why is he in ground form
  happy birthday uncle
  wait what that doesnt seem right
no way to get just the new decadriver and new cards    fuck off pbandai i already own the superbest decadriver and csm decadriver  binders and card set
  neo heisei was real all along
  i guess theyre too lazy to recreate the flame form suit
  dab on that hater geiz
  tsukasa is in the 5 episode    yes
  why is he dressed like a minion
saigo mikoto okuno whose body and soul have separated in fight against another ghost in order to regain consciousness of saigo gates oshida dake goes to the world of 2015 and turns into a rider gates and challenges fight against another ghost    however suddenly it was destroyed by the decade ryukyu who appeared suddenly and when robbed of the ghost ride watch the decade ride watch is handed over instead    soul who became a spirit brings takel hayao nishi to the world of 2015 i succeeded in rescuing my brother makimura naoki horiike trying to protect mika tayemasa hana at the expense of himself and changing history takeru transforms into makoto ryosuke yamamoto and kamen rider ghost spector and fights eyeball commands 
geiz has jobbed to exaid beast zio and decade  who is next to crush upon him
  no more sex jacket  now its scraps from the gap for waga maoh from now on
  i    zio what are you no youre standing on the wrong side how the fuck are you even
  woz for the glory of his king
  post raw synopsis
  its always here  
  that frieza
right after zio episode  
  huh    ive never seen such a skinny ghost before he always looked so fat whos decades suit actor how skinny is he
  decade just takes the book from woz    jesus christ he still does whatever the fuck he wants
  kek
yo where can i find a raw of ep 13
  even woz jobs to decade
  i swear to god decades seriously like a live action animu character
  fuck i want it but with shipping its 113 usd
  i believe it is sold out already  just now
  that decade and ag double rider kick
  no fear   no pain
  well time to kill myself
  decade is really popular
dodging drive armor speed with agito senses  hibiki drum final attack ride  god i fucking missed him
any videos of the decade ridewatch toy yet
so was decade able to save this series
awesome glad the neodecadriver wasnt shopped
  it didnt need saving
what will decades driver be like when he obtains all riders power up to 2067
  who let takaiwa wear the kuuga suit
  a second ridebooker
  so far yes its that combine with takeru having a lot more proactive role by appearing very early on in the 2parter which is very rare for returning we are probably also going to get sougo bonding with too which is also rare
          anyone know if itll support the csm cards because it supported the dx ones
  so is that camera masahiros or camera guys
  since its probably just a repaint of the dx using the same reader and silly belt no it already comes with the 20 rider and final attack cards though only the extra cards attacks and forms are missing
  he got an error  makes me feel better about how often i fuck up putting the card in
        so no attack ride cards like invisible or illusion  hope the old ones work on the new belt
  jsans  masahiro has already given away his decade merchandise
  seriously aw
  just give me alain nod in the show
  alright confirmed i dont remember what my trip was so from now this is my trip remember this if you want to filter me
  literally this
  this shits hilarious
    another ghost attacks plastic chairs near a takoyaki stand when he went berserker thats your alain nod
have you warmed up to this form guys
  
anyone got the daily motion yet
  tokus diamond boy
  hold on i need bgm for this annoucement  flips to the passing through kamen rider soundtrack  okay so the xmas event is breaks down laughing  i love maaaaaasahiro
  mm well its kinda excessively bulky but seeing as how its zio i guess its okay because most of his shits kinda on the bulky side it reminds me more of the sic decade figure though ill admit the face is prettier to look at at the very least holy shit that sic figure is hideous the third or fourth ugliest legitimate toy id ever seen    see my biggest concern though is what happens after zio because by then hell get a different suit actor right for crossovers and stuff so what if someone way skinnier wears that suit itd probably look weird wouldnt it the leg armor would stick out even more and that chestpiece dear god that chestpiece its clearly tailormade for takaiwa
  i still hoping we see decade using that suit once with the decade driver there is a zio card so theres a chance
    seriously its bulkiness probably wouldnt lose to the new rider 1 suit
  i really like it but to be fair i already liked decades suit and this just feels like sic decade
  holy shit takaiwas so fat that he can barely fit into sparkling
  
        jjust a shoop gguys  sstop posting fakes gguys  retards btfo
futari wa
   loses everything he cares about to omazio   goes back in time to defeat a weaker zio   still gets his shit kicked in   timejackers and woz continue to bully him   turns tail and gets pep talked to defy fate   starts getting his groove back to get his shit kicked in decade    geiz has a hard life
  that signature takaiwa bulge on decade
  so this clearly proves that decade is immune to another rider fuckery its said that two of the same power cant exist simultaneously but hes literally using the ghost power while another ghost exists
  diend looks like an escalator    true fact
  its like that but less shitty cleaner lines more streamlined relatively speaking mind you
  diend looks more like a ps2
  decades rider powers technically are all just constructs based on the data on the cards rather than the actual power of the riders but we know hes completely immune since theres a scan with decade vs decade armor
  it always seemed like the armors were exceptions to that rule i mean zio build armor can exist simultaneously with another build
  pretty much yes tsukasas a multilarity point apparently whose existence isnt tied to any single world basically a superior version of denos singularity points i dont think any time fuckery be it time jacker or zio will affect him or his powers i bet he can kamen ride into build exaid and wizard even though sougos already taken their powers
  but both undo the original rider its just they dont affect each other likely due to both being part of the whole watch system
  its all hakaisha now
  when is this going up for sale
  weve seen a shot of him holding the kamenride build card and him using kamenride ghost with aghost and ghost armor around shows that his powers transcend everything
  my wife
  fucking decade cant even obey the rules of the world hes visiting i hope he fucks off soon decade ruins everything onore
  ver20 dx decade driver  taking orders 2 days ago    dx decade ride watch  12/8    dx neo decade driver  starts taking orders 12/2 deadline 1/8
  is ugly
  fuck off
  neo decadrivers sold out already
  nine slated episodes
  decade originally uses nine riders powers  slated for nine episodes in zio  is he gonna be in like 18 episodes for 3o
  gee decade how come toei lets you have nine slated episodes
  man the years really took a toll on decade huh
  its odd that the shot of regular decade has the new suit actor whereas the shot of neodecade has takaiwa in it
    those pink/magenta replies
  the shot of regular decade was taken from one of the portraits for climax fighters the neo decade is just a shoopd image of old takaiwa decade
    how its not even listed anywhere that sells p bandai are you one of those scalpers or niggers as i like to call them
  or that is the stock photo of takaiwa from 10 years ago
gackt
tsukasas back and he immediately styles on fucking everyone like its just another day for him  god i missed decade
  takaiwa wasnt so chubb yet back in decade though
  masahiros a god hes fully embracing his inner tsukasa
  gackts returning to write a theme song for decade
  nope takaiwa wasnt fat but he still had more meat on him than you think he did the decade suit was designed solely for him meaning hes the only one who was able to fill it out nearperfectly hes always had a weird ass
  マゼンタだ
  bait
so if its sold out already just how many available preorders were there
  middlemen already have it up
i hope ot dont take too long this week
    retard eops it doesnt say that
  マゼンタじゃない 桂だ
  あれは違う番組だぞ全然関係ない
  its not that anon is just being a faggot
    hes just talking about the theme song from movie wars 2010 and somehow mixed it up with sht
  i mean im not sure what ever program translated the tweet would appreciate being called that
  people that have never watched decade pretending they love decade because hes now in current show  i hate fake decade fans
  never believe people from here when it comes to the availability of something /toy/ niggers will do anything to throw people off so they can make sure they get their own reservations in especially for something that will have a huge resell value
im tempted to get one of those drivers how would i go about ordering something off pbandai
  decade doesnt give a fuck about rules in fact thats one of his powers remember when he killed an undead in blades world
  using 3rd party vendors the catch is that its not like amiami so youll be paying up front for the item
  so the ridewatch is online purchase only
tfw wozs real identity is ryoutaro
  oh shit its been a while since i last saw that shooting place
im over halfway through faiz now thanks for helping out with which sub to go with and im really digging it so far kusaka is a total asshole and i just dont see him redeeming himself at this point but well see    at which point should i watch paradise lost i read that it was one of those alternate timeline movies like episode final for ryuki but dont know if it spoils anything in the main series      speak of the devil i loved episode final but felt 13 riders was just wasted potential verde was kinda neat but that was the whole novelty of it to me
  even when god was a cheerleader for friendship
  just because his show sucks doesnt mean people cant like the character/suit
  arguably better than real decade fans
  tghostcuck
  why would i want the original decadriver when the neo decadriver has everyone in it
  what
  masahiro is my favorite actor in rider decade the show was pretty mediocre but he made it a lot of fun and i love when this fucker is in any role
  cause its pink  and pink is for girls
  i hate the face with a passion rest of the suits alright if a bit too bulky
  there is a reveal shown in the movie before the tv show although most of the japanese audience saw it first in the movie due to it debuting midway through
  it is magenta for fucks sake
  mashiro sounds like a real cool guy
  neoktouch comes in white colors to contrast
  decade is magenta but the neodecadriver is pink
    post yfw they get his wife to be in a rider show
  i guess theyre too lazy to recreate the flame form suit    yes being lazy rather then this scene doesnt really need it so lets not spend around 1000 to recreate this armor we dont have anymore is the correct way to view this situation
geiz wont get to win until he gets revive  that lasts only the debut episode and hell job straight away the next one
  then dont create a scene where agito requires a sword
  has the same bitch please face as masahiro  yeah thats definitely his kid
  マゼンタだ
  grows up to heavily resemble masahiro  inherits the role of decade from his dad  and thus decade being an immortal cyborg is canon
  wait why dont they have it anymore they were able to use trinity form for kamen rider taisen so they should have access to it somehow
  cringe
  or just you know dont use the fucking sword
    more like he has a sword the ridebooker
  wasnt she queen serenity in the sailor moon live action
  toei has strict laws about no nepotism in their shows if he wants to be a rider like his dad hell need to go under an alias or something
so what happens if you insert another decade ridewatch into the decade ridewatch
  decadeception
  shut the fuck up ghostcuck
      you do know decades able to summon altforms weapons without having to turn into that form thats what the attackride cards are for    hell he even summoned g4s gigant without turning into g4
  eh i passed it off as dickeido doing whatever the fuck he wants as usual
  he can only do that with violent emotion
  no they dont     look at toshiki inoue he managed to over stay his sell date because of his dads connections to the franchise    or for another toei franchise shaider whose actor was the grandson of the guy who created godzilla and ultraman
  
  are you memeing or what
  is it that takumi is an orphnoch i just got to that episode
  with the regular decadriver yes but he clearly isnt using the regular decadriver
  cool head canon
  he managed to over stay his sell date because of his dads connections to the franchise  im pretty sure he did that due to writing several big success  from agito to hibikis 2nd half everything inoue touched turned into gold yes hibikis 2nd half had higher ratings than the first half    it was only afterwards he started stumbling and even so it didnt take long for them to sideline him  first with kabutos ratings dropping as soon as he joined the show with drakes arc then kivas having a mediocre performance in addition to the show shafting the toys and finally the next bombing    afterwards his rider writing was really sporadic 4 decade episodes due to ti being an anniversary season and him writing so many series the ooo part of core and then the rider 1 movie  this final one being the only one where he was brought back specifically due to his father rather than just due to his own previous work
  yeah thats the one
  headcanon  have you ignored the news today its a new belt called the neo decadriver and theyre already showing it has new functions like turning into phase 2 heisei riders
  considering how his decadriver suddenly gained belt camoflaging abilities in sht id say hes been getting upgrades along the way
  that stiff smile
  or for another toei franchise shaider whose actor was the grandson of the guy who created godzilla and ultraman    godzilla and ultraman are not toeis
  i sorta wish that more of the another riders used bastardized versions of the original rider powers like build and wizard did with their belts
  more like use the actual basic weapons of their respective riders another gaim would have been empty without that distorted form of daidaimaru to support its combat style doesnt make sense to make them all do fistfights instead of using the tools that their respective riders use all the time
  your the neeeeeeeeext  next decaaaaaaaade
  the another riders that desperately need their originals weapons are faiz deno wizard exaid and ghost
  faiz edge is probably a little more expensive than theyre willing to recreate for a monster that only appears in two episodes
  i wish they did it like another gaim who had like a fusion of the daimairu and one of the overlords weapons
  two episodes  say hello to evil ridewatch and suit recycling later on
  is that the new bogdanoff
  i wouldnt even mind if toei recolored or modified the suits as upgraded another riders
does anyone have any ideas as to when these build movies will be available
whats the coolest belt toy
  id say probably ooo fourze wizard and build drivers
  build driver  a cool or even good for that matter toy    please get out fujoshit
  he said cool not good
   cool or even good for that matter toy    first two words
  the sengoku and meteor drivers were pretty based in my opinion
  the fourze and build drivers are way too clunky to be cool
  belt itself faiz belt or mach driver if you want one of the best lines because youre trying to make a purchase decision and want overall value grab the gamer driver and some gashats or sengoku driver if you can find one at a reasonable price id recommend the former personally the only downside is you need to keep the plastic tabs so you can keep the batteries from running dry from just sitting there lockseeds have off switches the normal gashats dont neither does muteki or mmx for that matter only the duals have off switches which baffles me
      all four of those drivers has an icerelated gimmick
  the build driver has a cool way of transforming i like the cranking thing and the voice but the gimmicks themselves really let you down so objectively speaking its not a great belt id rank it over the drive driver though that one has a weird shape an ir gimmick and pintab upgrades the mach driver has the pintabs but it at least has a cool look with that delicious chrome and a fun way of using it with the flip down bit and lightup fire i still say to this day the gamer driver is probably one of the most fun belts while the sengoku driver is better if you like your gimmicks not having to need a piece of paper or plastic to keep from running out of battery
  yes the belt itself are the batteries replaceable also whats the best website to order these from that does international shipping i would think that mandarake would be okay
  those jokes were shitty especially when theres actual ice related riders/belts
  are the batteries replaceable    yes lr44/ag13 are the batteries the gashats lockseeds memories watches etc use you can pick them up easily     also whats the best website to order these from that does international shipping     for older stuff mandarake is best amiami and hlj are good for newer stuff cstoys and kotetsu are okay sometimes as they both have a tendency to overcharge a fair amount   and as a last resort ebay and amazon are always there too
  mandarake hands down theres a few gamer drivers with mighty action x up for around 50 usd theres a version with max the belt the finishing move slot and the baksou bike gashat and they run around 90 usd preshipping shipping is going to suck if you want it fast ems will run you around 2030 usd depending but youll get it in 2 weeks or so usually dx gashats run around 1220 usd each for the single ones but some of the dual gashats can get ridiculously pricey as well as the exclusives in the 120 usd  range before shipping     you can replace the batteries easily but they aint cheap lr44s are the little cell batteries and each gashat takes 3 they do last a while though the gamer driver thankfully is just plastic and mirrors so it doesnt take any batteries
      worst part for me is i still need taddle fantasy to have all the main rider gashats from exaid ive got legacy and the dual gear beta but not fantasy oddly enough i did manage to snag all of exaids upgrades though which is more than i can say for gaim one of my holy grails is the kachidoki/kiwami set and someday i will be able to afford one
  witch other kamen rider fight there the place seems so familiar even with the plastic chairs gaim maybe
  gaim exaid as well as some sentai
  what the fuck were they thinking with builds legend forms    other than saving money of course
  man build has the laziest legend rider forms     now that i think about it the legend rider schtick renders zios powers pointless like whats so special about him when other riders have legend memories/medals/switches/rings/lockseeds/eyecons/gashats that can access past riders powers
this week on super hero time
  even geiz and tsukuyomi are pissed by cure henri  it is no longer oma zio that concerns them anymore it is male precures
  why is agito in gaims colors
  
  you mean taddle quest fantasy is the one in the gear dual
  yeah that the blue one sorry im tired and not thinking right its the last lv2 gashat i need to have all 5 of the main ones including proto max the purple one
  well the issue with builds form system is that you cant actually tell that its supposed to be a legend rider form at first glance
  heres the funny thing about builds decade form first off the belt doesnt change so he cant transform into other riders he cant use basic attackrides like slash or illusion he cant use final formrides all he can do is use a vortex finish now since he does have the ridebooker so he should at least be able to use the dimensionseries attacks kick slash blast but still there isnt much point to being able to transform into decade if you cant even use his basic abilities
  i mean it feels so wrong wouldnt a male magical girl just be a rider  shouldnt a male magical girl just be a rider
  more like why even bother giving him the ability when he only used it for a single scene hell the exaid riders used the concept more than he did      like whats so special about him when other riders have legend memories/medals/switches/rings/lockseeds/eyecons/gashats that can access past riders powers    he actually uses them consistently instead of only during special occasions     truthfully though its kind of annoying how less thought out zios armors are compared to well every other series handling of them im kind of glad they arent as straightforward as transforming directly into a past rider but at the same time some of them or so vague they might as well be standalone armors
decade goes to the world of precure and kills henri
  well up until now legend rider forms were really just minor gimmicks that utilized the legend rider toys that had been released since w but were never made use of in any significant way up until fourze legend rider memories and medals existed but they were pretty pointless it wasnt until fourze when they really started doing anything giving fourze modules that allowed him to utilize a single ability of the respective rider fundamentally all they did was copy one or two of the riders abilities usually giving them the exact same weapon as used by that rider as well zio kinda bucks that trend since all his weapons are technically unique
  medals were pointless  they were a macguffin in megamax
  zios legend rider powers are canon
  i think they meant shaider are we talking og shaider or next generation
  preorders are definitely still up just did mine
  ng shaider
  build driver   clunky
reaction threads on 5ch made fun of horas line 私をハメるつもりare you planning to set me up/fuck me
  what site do you use cause ny doesnt have it listed yet
  giving fourze modules that allowed him to utilize a single ability of the respective rider  wasnt that ganbaride only iirc the legend switches and medals in megamax only released their respective riders from containment
  legend rider forms are with rare exceptions made with ganbaride in mind and only thrown into the movies later as an extra
  i guess its more like cranky
bros
  i went through tokullectibles price is a bit steeper but free shipping from the us so im willing
  have you used this site before im always iffy about ones i havent already had a history with i do like that i can pay half now though
  ive only used them once and it was for the evol driver back in may in that case he got the evol stuff in batches so i think it took about an extra week to get to me but the guy who runs the site is pretty responsive when i was asking about my order i cant speak for his deposit payments though
  people still remember this irrelevant meme rider  lol wine xdd
  not that anon but i used tokullectibles once before to preorder the rogue figuarts and had no problems
  how is the build driver clunky   its the most streamline belt weve gotten since the sengoku driver
  two young wolves partake in hot sheath play
  its literally a brick with a handle anon
  wait a minute you fucker thats not even the full webm
  kuri and inoue are great together
  how can you possibly think thats more streamlined than the drive driver
lets get into the second half predictions    after koutas speech to sougo i can only figure most if not all of the riders are letting themselves be erased from history by sougo so he can bring them all back once everything is over then they can all also play a game of pretend on the rider tournament
  so basically all riders vs dai shocker
  heh here i am sitting with two kachidoki lockseeds though ones second spring is kinda weird
  my moneys still on sougo performing a ruse on the actual big bad and the rider statue scene will have every rider pop out and beat on the big bads army
  amiami
wake up kamenriding  subs when
    thursday
  its not there but apparently tokullectibles unsold out
  ghosts suit actor is thursday
  amiami dont sell pbandai stuff unless its a second hand item which wont be a preorder
post world destroyers
just reserved my decadriver feels good man
  itll be my third and possibly fourth driver since its still a ways away i need to come up with a better display method running out of space
  i only have a few drivers since ive only recently had the room to actually buy belts and other collectibles first was a w belt and the other is zios belt this is also the first year im attempting cosplay so im looking forward to finally getting to let out my inner manchild
having fun
they didnt bring back aoi yuuki for just the 5 episode  zio is ruined  how could john toei do this to me
wow soon i can have a weekly geizseething compilation
  this is wonderful
they actually brought up dragonball in relation to ghosts plot    5 episodes are the absolute best thing from kamen rider in the past eight or so years
  tsukuyomi is getting tired of his incompetence
  at least he doesnt need a stunt double for the beginning scene or something
  arent they in a competing timeslot with dragonball too  it made it doubly funny to me frankly that they were able to joke about the similarities to their competitor  also takerus actor was really having a field day with that yurusen and drive impression i almost feel bad his show never let him shine
  its only fair considering the tournament of power arc for super was one big jab at all the competing shows
  no super ended a few months ago anon
  ima hitori hitori
did they mention the third rule in the 5 episode
  yes but what is it
  pretty sure super got ended due to production costs and problems you know unlike kamen rider which is still going strong and its toys are selling out minutes within preorders going live
  due to production costs and problems  nah they just gave it a break to build hype for the movie      which is still going strong and its toys are selling out minutes within preorders going live  this is bait
  oh shit i didnt know it ended   not that i was going to watch it    john toei always win baby
  you do know that toei owns dragon ball right
    i mean we all know it will have a new season its toeis biggest cashcow
  he cant keep getting away with it
  super pretty much killed all my interest in dragon ball im not even going to bother watching any movies or future series fucking dead to me was really fucking easy having to choose between kamen rider and dbs when timeslots overlapped one i was always excited to watch each week and the other wasnt even funny to laugh at anymore
  decade joins criasu corp
  this is bait  are you fucking retarded or have you not been paying attention to people trying to buy the fucking toys in these threads
  i wish someone would do this but blade
  one i was always excited to watch each week  how do you get excited for this shit   its the same thing every year and it still hasnt improved even with the timeslot change  good rider season has a shitty rushed ending or last half   bad rider season is just boring with no real story issues besides decade of course  the crossover and summer movies are just meh or garbage with rare exceptions
  rider is the same thing every year  pretty sure were not watching the same show  dbs is the same thing every arc but worse each time  this is more accurate
  why the fuck are you even here
  because im just passing through like your faggot gaylord mashitro does
  funny funny stuff
  probably salty that kamen rider cancelled dragon ball super
what are the ratings on super
come in to talk about zio and decade  get dragon ball posts  spics ruin everything
  makes post about db  be the change you want to be
next week we get decade ghost and another ghost vs ghost and zio ghost armor
  what were they saying in 5 about drive and actor availability
  0  it doesnt air anymore
  specter is there too
  cause ive been watching this shit since blade finished airing and wanted someone to talk about kr with         im wasnt defending dragon ball i was happy that super ended so you can stop flaseflagging now
  decade ghost vs ghost  this better be kino
makoto onichan
  what were the ratings then id search the archives on /a/ but search is disabled at the moment
  shhh
reminder
screencap this post kamen rider will get a new series after zio and dragon ball wont in 2019
  stop reminding me that its sold out i literally had my money ready and it was gone within fucking minutes of it going on sale yes im fucking pissed
  ill be laughing at you for subestimating toeis thrist for money especially with the olympic games coming up
  so zio is suddenly good now
  just wait for the csm version 
gegege no kitaro gets higher ratings than what dbs did its pretty much the shonen anime timeslot and channel that gives it the undeserved ratings boost
  kamen rider wont be going away for a long time not as long as the plastic crack they churn out flies off the shelves within days or even minutes of them being available to preorder or buy
    dont samefag
if anythings not getting a series in the future is sentai
expecting complete form
  sentai hasnt been entertaining for several years now that and every episode wastes at least a few minutes with the shitty mecha shilling with predictable outcome
  its back on now  
  why would you want the kids version
  stop my wallet can only handle so much
  whats that mean k touch nob
  oh god the site wont even load because of how much traffic its getting
  its just the button you press to take the main belt part the magenta bit for the neodecadriver off the buckle to replace batteries   with it being just a straight up recolour of the og decadriver it still has it so there may be a new ktouch but there probably wont
  straight up recolour  that reminds me of what i want to ask i dont have any of the belts dx or csm but does anyone know if the rider emblems on the driver screen printed or has abcess and reversewashed for the dx and csm respectively if they are different
      id guess what happened is that they planned a more developed system but then decided against it since they learned the next show would be all about legend forms but they still had to market the exaid item
    sjw finally tainting anime
  is this unaired footage of kuuga vs daguva
  henri isnt the first male precure but he is the biggest faggot of all those
so if im not wrong decade agito was having storms reflexes wielding flames sword while being in ground form its like another variation of violent emotion
    whatever happened to rr and tt
  neo shocker
  whats the context of him blowing up the earth
        aint he just copying off au riders powers
  hes recreating them through his memories
  you meant the au one
anyone else bothered by agito decade finisher ended in some random crouch instead of agito pose
  the suit actor just forgot to move and readjust his legs position while hes crouching the initial posing was agitos finishing move nonetheless it does look stiff yes but it wasnt that bad
  i meant the stones on his driver works as such
theres two fake zio 13 at anidex and it doesnt look like theyre going away anytime soon fyi
  someone has to get the overtime ridewatch to erase the another overtime
  you should stick with nyaa only until anidexs admins stop fucking around
  precure is for tranny tumblrfaggots now  i hate this shit
  
    
  im not sure about the csm but the dx has some sort of stencil wash for the emblems      its actually the crisis empires homeworld that just so happens to be an alternate future earth
  the alien empire from the demon world attacking earth in black rx turns out to be actually from a mirror earth from another dimension that was in critical condition due to crisis empire disregarding its environment so they wanted to annihilate earths population to take their own population to the main earth coexistence was impossible since they had a population of 15 billions or something     when black rx destroys the emperor the mirror earth is taken out alongside it    its a bizarre story direction since the first half of the show had shown several resistance groups fighting against the emperor but the 2nd half of the series wanted the viewer to completely forget that the demon world had any sympathetic characters to set up this ending where its just blown up
shun whips out a fucking yurusen prop during the 5 episode  god these are so much better than the actual episodes so far
man its such a fucking shame that ghost got shafted if ghost was more like this recent arc and less like soccer moms wanted it to be it might have been a great show
  finish overtime break
  there was so much love in the final thing tracked it to the belt and everything
  its only right given how much love masahiro has for decade
i wish you guys would stop sucking off decades magneta cock
  only if /krg/ stops sucking off a garbage show like zio and yet here we are
  we arent that doesnt come out until dec 8th
  but without zio decade wouldnt come back
  only after we purge ghostfags
starting my annual december binge of christmas specials and episodes aside from the obvious exaid what other rider shows have good christmas episodes worth adding to the pile i remember wizard having one
  wizard literally have santa on its christmas special go watched it    drive also had an unusual threeparter for its christmas special its also quite good and i sympathized with shinnosukes dilemma
  out of all the christmas specials id say drive and exaid did it best it did a good job of highlighting all the shit shinnosuke is dealing with at the time and has a really cute dinner scene exaid pulls the rug out from under you by having half the episode be haply funtime techno christmas and then ends with dan murdering a guy that had just warmed up to the mc the only one of the group at the time in fact
  memetoku
  one only can dream
do i need to watch all of phase 1 heisei before watching decade is decade like the kingdom hearts of kamen rider
how do i get into showa
so uhhhh  is zio any good havent watched rider since gaim
  just pick one at random
  only watch black and black rx 7802
  yea
  zios good but definitely not in the same way gaim was good if youre looking for another gaim look elsewhere
does tsukasa wore a wig or dying his hair between zio and jinga
  wig is more likely for tsukasas hair
skyridergang kamen rider 1979  episodes 111
  tn
  watch build if you want something like gaim
    actually he dyed his hair to film zio
watching build on local tv is great but the dub feels like tvn if they had dubbing capability
  but agito finish is kicking past the enemy do the stupid pose turn then boom
  is build really that good
  meme subs
  no its just more overrated than gaim was which is quite a hard thing to do really but homos are bigger retards than butcherfags so hey
  id say its better than gaim but then i never rode gaims dick during its run and just thought it was pretty good from the start so    not him but after gaim youve got drive which is pretty solid too id also say its better than gaim personally but i dunno how youd feel about it ghost which you should only watch if you hate yourself exaid which was pretty fun but just kinda a b compared to gaim drive and builds a
  yes   blood stalk is one of the best heisei villains
  build was a lot of fun entertaining big bad nice fights solid story and good characters   also like gaim episodes were more one long story than a bunch of twoparters stitched together
  very good beginning and middle part  interesting and solid characters plot and rider design  best belt sounds  stalk    con  too much toy shilling  wasted rider forms  worthless or unnecessary side characters  unsatisfactory ending
ok so how long till the subs are out please dont tell me its gonna be another fucking half week again
  its gonna take a full week this time round
  nice yet another reason to kill myself 
  how is the dub
  its like picking up someone off the street and put it in front of the mic
the decade ridewatchs jingle is really fucking good  
  damn thats good  shame about the suit
  decade decade  dikeido
would you get a rider related tattoo
  i wouldnt get a tattoo in general
  so far i have a lotof tattoos so i wouldnt mind having a rider related one i just dont have a good idea for one
decade might actually have the worst story in the entire franchise but his actors smug performance makes it super entertaining regardless
  so like american anime dubs
  oh they actuall found a use for teh crossz watch
  i want the build symbol
  if you get anything but the kuuga simbol then what the fuck are you doing
does anyone have ryos do flowers have dreams monologue
when the fuck is figure rise releasing the exaid model i already preordered their kabuto zio kabuto and faiz and have build on my desk
  that doesnt seem like a takumi pose
  this isnt a decade pose at all
  its part of the suit to show the dick every photo of exaid have it
  thank you for this picture i appreciated it
  he looks fat
  ghost suits covered in a tone of plastic including the abdominal region so its hard not to look fat in it somehow decades suit actor in zio is able to wear it and make it look thin so he must be skinny as fuck
  takumi please try to look more energetic
  zio is good    in which universe
what was the general opinion of the ryuki riders designs back in the day theyre the first set of designs that really deviated from tradition even ryuki who has the bug eyes shoehorned under his helmets grill looks far different from any of his predecessors that doesnt even get into something like zolda whos just a straightup metal hero
  the gaim suit always looked to me like it would be really hot and stuffy like moreso than most rider suits i think its the padded/quilted undersuit and the fact that its made of fauxleather
  ryuki knight and zoldas designs are intentional theyve all got loose qualities of what makes a kamen rider and thus they have unique undersuits and parts of their helmets that make them standout and make them closer to riders ryuki has the eyes knight has the crusher jaw and zolda has the antennae
  the one where ghost was more like the one we saw in surprise future
  hes the same in both that and his series
    im getting sick of you filipinos and your shit taste
  there are people who still think zio is anything but good
  not at all takeru in show acts nothing like he did in the movie cameo notably his fighting style using more tricks and deception while being more nonchalant
  had continuity issues before his series started  are you sure you want that anon
  the one where youre still in denial so this one
  go watch ghost anon he does the same thing
since i dont understand moon whats the role of decade here storywise
  exaid which was pretty fun but just kinda a b compared to gaim  only if b stands for better
        look retards im still watching zio every week so its not ghost levels of terrible where i dropped it after the first episode aired but lets not kid ourselves saying zio is anything but a 5/10 show right now i like the characters the premise and like half of the suits but everything else is sloppy it has potential though and this weeks episode with decade might finally start escalating things and that rating could climb
  woz knows him somehow and called him to help the time jackers that one girl wondered if he didnt want to become the next king but he doesnt like the idea
  you are still a filipino who needs his ass kicked
  nope its pretty good sorry you went through the trouble of typing all that for nothing
  why do you think youre opinion matter if you drop a show after the first episode
  he got burned by that before plus he never really had any interest in becoming king to begin with otherwise he would have been more interested in nega otoyas offer    besides being king is too stifling hes a traveler
  no he doesnt he occsionally still flew around but not in the same ghost like manner in did in the movie
  lets not kid ourselves saying zio is anything but a 5/10 show right now  zio is easily at least a 6/10
  how can you say that show is bad if you never watched it past the first episode most recent rider shows had bad first episodes
  stop posting these awful you pics
  i am brazilian and ive been watching this shit for longer than youve been able to count to 10      you still replied        because i can smell the suck from far away i dropped the show rather than wasting my time then checked on the community once in a while to see if it got any better which it never did apparently    i dropped exaid in the same manner but picked up when the shows 12th episode aired      thats fair enough
  this one
while everything before it was subpar the ooo arc was decent with an interesting twist on the timejackers tactics and a nice chunk of development for both sougo and geiz bolstered by eiji being great and playing a genuinely helpful role in sougos journey and then the gaim arc was just flat out great constantly entertaining fun fruit jesus cameos the first legitimately interesting scenario exploiting timeline fuckery and really well done fight direction    if you cant see that this show is starting to kick things into high gear i dont know what to tell you youve convinced yourself i guess
  no
  i feel like this is just a variation of sougos plan in the last twoparter woz wants sougo to obtain the power of all riders knows decade has the decade ridewatch and so by having them clash via decade siding with the timejackers knows that sougo will end up with the watch sooner and speed up the process of becoming oma zio
  i am brazilian  your kind are just as bad as filipinos if its not black its shit to you people
  nothing starts as bad as ghost did to be honest shitty characters and bland everything
  im very critic actually im not one to follow hiveminds black was ok and certainly is the better one from showa which isnt saying much but over half the episodes are trash youd only be able to enjoy if youre a child the good episodes are really good though
  nothing starts as bad as ghost did  stop shitposting anon zio has the worst start out of any rider series   not everything about ghost is bad
  hues still dont deserve to have opinions
  i guess i do else youd say i was full of shit
  you hamburgers have the bootleg sabums rangers so fuck off
no takaiwa  
  dont act like power rangers wasnt always imported over here less than a year after airing in america and sentai didnt went the way of the dodo
im just passing through kamen rider
  yeah what about it   power rangers is currently more successful than sentai right now
  yall bootlegged juspion and bioman dont fucking throw stones
  and its still all they had for eons  burger lover
  nope we had the original juspion series  bioman was in france
  power rangers is an officially endorsed product used for international super sentai sales its not a bootleg no matter how much you dislike it you stupid flip
  im hue
sworz the question is what do you have to offer to us  woz the one who poses the greatest obstacle to my lord that man is the destroyer of all one who can alter history itself    ora so what about this destroyer you were talking about where is he  woz unfortunately hes a rather whimsical individual it seems that my lord has begun moving so perhaps we should call for him    ora why didnt you finish them off  decade ive pretty much got the gist of them for now thats fine  ora oh not bad if you were to become king i wouldnt mind giving your a hand  decade king huh not interested im a passing through kamen rider the destroyer of worlds
  had  now youre literally bootlegging juspion  
  ora wants the dickade
  power rangers is an officially endorsed product used for international super sentai sales  as shitty as saban as a person is he was a smart businessman
how long until sougo starts to suffer for real he cant be this happy to be a king for so long
  wait for him to meet his future self
  sopa do macaco  uma delicia
  zio looks good when he isnt fat
  we actually are making our version not mixing original battle footage with new filming  also its because jaspion is a big cultural icon in brazil and the movie is for the 30th anniversary      he really was he wanted to bring the original bioman but was refused by the sponsors thats why he decided adaptating a show was the best approach on us
one thing i do like about the show is zio and geiz use their base forms a lot i know its early in the show and they have to use the ridewatches as finishers because of the story but its nice to see their base forms often
  why would he fight his past self wouldnt it have major repercussions on 2068
  futures changing gotta keep his past self in line so it doesnt get worse
  if the future doesnt divide in infinite futures oma zio knows what he is doing because he already did that being the sougo of 2018   if not maybe oma zio is watching all the history being changed and he wants to preserve his timeline so he has t fight our sougo
  maybe he remembers beating his own ass and is just completing the cycle
drive arc  type delorean
  stop being a faggot anon
  no the another riders existing in their original years and then subsequently being killed by the ridewatches doesnt change anyones memory of what the ars did completely erasing it from their memories oma fighting his 2018 self will change nothing
  its amazing how much better the suit looks on a nonfat fuck suit actor same with ghost
one thing thats pretty interesting to me is how the time jackers dont really seem to know much about decade im also really curious as to how woz knows how to summon him summoning decade shouldnt be easy its impossible to know when or where hell show up if at all
  drive arc  type lawsuit
  knock 10 times on the door of a particular photo studio
  id guess oma zio himself is immune to time changes as the king of time but if sogo starts heading to a different future then his world itself might be changed and hes there to ensure that doesnt happen even if it involves killing his past self or just showing how hes powerless and must follow omas path    before that were also an episode with him sending a warrior to the past
decade will always be remembered due to masahiro and his charisma even if it was a weird series that was cut short and hated at the time it will be remembered fondly now that the initial backlash is gone    so lacks any charisma and will have his series forgotten or just disliked forever his favourite series is kiva too what a fag
  pretty sure he only got the role because his friend was in kiva and he was hanging around set
  they probably liked the cut of his jib so they probably had him audition and decided yep this kids our destroyer of worlds
  do you want to be a kamen rider  idk sure
its honestly a stroke of luck that they got someone like masahiro for decade imagine if it were someone like odagiri i mean admittedly its a shame that the first heisei rider has little love for the franchise and has no desire to return but what can you do i mean its not as if they had any intention of doing crossovers at stuff when they made kuuga
    its still too early to say that the upcoming episodes with kashin and oma zio will be very telling regarding the direction of the series and the overall reaction to it    decade had a lot of hype during its run in spite of the complaints about lack of veterans the whole multiversal crash and large numbers of monsters and riders every episode created lots of hype and talk the issue mostly lied with the endings which was most likely intentionally downplayed to prop up w considering some of the known production changes done to movie wars 2010    zio is going much harder in bringing back actors but the overall set up is very underwhelming right now in spite of having all past series as a playground which is why where the series goes in the upcoming episodes will be very important
if you had it good in the future and you found out your past self was fucking around trying to prevent the future that is you wouldnt you go back to the past asap and beat your younger selfs ass until he listened
  its honestly a stroke of luck that they got someone like masahiro for decade  he loves rider and isnt super duper famous how is it lucky that he returned
whats stopping gayz from going back in time when he gets his suit upgrade and killing sougo
  hes not doing too badly he does what he loves and what he loves is chuuni
  he said it himself geiz is tsundere for sougo
  same reason ren couldnt kill shinji when he had the chance to
stylish
  geiz cant stop the will of the universe
  geiz tries to kill past sougo with revive  he accidentally brings back that sougo who then becomes the catalyst for zio ii
  he clearly isnt going to kill him before he actually goes evil
  now sougo is dead and geiz doesnt seem very happy about that
   accidentally brings back that sougo who then becomes the catalyst for zio ii
  i still think zio ii is coming from oma zio being defeated or erased from time thus the gold zio watch
oma zio sougo and regular sougo combines to form zio 
  fuck right
  when you realize you never did get to try those sea cucumbers
  kamen rider zio dx time mazine geiz mode  diend ridewatch  kaito will return right
  diend ride watch has the same design as decades but it summons riders  fucking yes please
  kamen rider zio dx time mazine geiz mode  diend ridewatch    what is that a thing confirmed anywhere
     but its order closed and no image
  nope
  huh    kamen rider zio dx time mazine geiz mode  diend ridewatchpreorder    considering the price it seems to be just a standard dx watch though rather than another decadelike one that can dock with other ride watches
  not worth it then
  what would a standard diend ridewatch even do if it cant interact with other ridewatches i mean i guess it could give you standard diend abilities blast invisible illusion barrier dimension shoot but
  the toy we all thought would be pbandai ends up getting a special treatment for retail distribution despite not being catalogued along with a nonmain dx ridewatch  yet dx neo decadriver is pbandai
diend watch doesnt summon riders  we wont get a heisniper weapon with a gekijouban scramble   i know heisniper is a terrible name compared to heisaber but its all i could think of
guy will we ever get good fights in kamen rider again or are we back to hit and run bullshit that lasts 1 minute build and the episodelong fights had me spoiled
  probably would have gotten a generic design anyway cant waste too much money on it
  we already got kaito back though
  fuck off buildfag
what is the best quality kamen rider kabuto sub release
holy ive been putting off kuuga and prew heisei rider for that matter for years and its really good
  yoyearthly did a scrub of kabuto in hd too
  heishooter
i havent watched decade how important is he to zio
  thank you very much
  extremely given how hes gonna be in 9 eps
    what the hell i need to watch decade before i have to watch zio now and now i have to watch every predecade heisei before decade
    you dont really need to know who he is it seems  just like you dont really need to know who any of the cameo characters are really in zio   he looks like hell be plot relevant but really all you need to know will probably be explained
  all you need to know is that hes a rider thats just passing through
  well most of the target audience wasnt even alive or old enough to remember decade or pre decade rider series so it probably wont matter much if youve seen it would be cooler if you had though
    sauce on this i havent heard he would be in 9 eps
  its supposed to be a video interview in the last thread im not sure hes there but either way we know he still will be around in the episodes after ghosts for december due to magazine scans
beater wand  beetle one  be the one
new thread
