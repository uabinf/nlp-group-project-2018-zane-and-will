does anyone have this papercraft  it was taken down everywhere and i cant find it
  i converted the pdo to pdf i hope its what you were looking for
  could you also post the zip with the pdo and textures
  i found the files here    sorry i do not do papercraft    
  thats the tiger but thank you for trying
ooops      i sent the wrong link sorry
here    
thank you
i believe these were done by a guy named tonton i made a collection of them 6 years ago in case anyone is interested     
  thank you
  thanks
  anon you wonderful human being  thanks
based thread these are cute
hi /po/ erm so as a grand gesture im going to send the girl i love a gift box for her birthday  she lives in another city she is back with her ex after telling me she doesnt have that spark with me  i have all the finer details planned gift letter and asking her professor to call her into her office before her birthday but i want to know if there are any ways to prepare the gift box  other than what i found on this website     youtube hasnt proven helpful  thanks /po/ and yeah i know it is hopeless but ill rahter go down swinging than watch from the sidelines desu
  my man its over  feelsbadmanjpeg  but you gotta move on
  i know but i must do this one last thing any help
  no man just let her go
    anon you are very strange she literally said she doesnt love you and got a new boyfriend and youve organized a scheme to confess your love to her
  its actually more complicated than that she does think im a good match for her and we have told each other that we love each other but she doesnt have this passion or spark feeling   then enter her ex who wormed his way back into her life and well it is just a shit situation    but this is just something i must do for me not her so that i can say i did everything and that the good guy lost in the end and im grateful to all the anons out there who tell it to you straight and dont sugarcoat it and im sure ill tell the next hopeless anon the same
  ahhh the highschool years when i thought unrequited love was meaningful
shut da fook up youll do fookin nuttin stop pretending like you got some stones everybody in this thread has been all up inside that tight little ass and let me tell you we aint impressed stop pretending like you aint some basedboy yourself
  but she doesnt have this passion or spark feeling  sounds like her way of putting you down gently instead of saying she doesnt love you
  sounds like her way of telling op he has a tiny penis without hurting his feelings
i suggest lining the inside of the box with dozens of notes made from cut out letters from magazines make each note about one part of her that you like and how you will take it from her if she doesnt come back to you
  and how you will take it from her if she doesnt come back to you  /po/ is a very dark place today (((
okay so i have wrapped the gift as per the websites instructions only thing left to do now is arrange with her proffessor that i may give it to her and that she would then give it to the girl       it is impossible to explain it anon we spoken about getting married and dreams and aspirations she is younger than i am and she needs this passion feeling if you read up on this passion vs compatibility it claims that younger women need the passion more than compatibility       that is way too much effort and if i wanted to go that routte id just call or text her
inside of the box
contents  jane eyre  the hot zone  lip balm  her favourite chocolate
  oh god this wasnt a joke post anon dont do this
  the good guy lost in the end  good guy  lol      this desu though im still a bit sad about letting my teenager years and my teenager self go so delet 
inb4 this is a 200 iq attempt at reviving the board
  nice paranoia in reality that girl got something sweet to eat while sliding up and down her exs dong while op sits in the corner and watches
  no anon it isnt a joke as i said i feel like i must do it thanks for your concern and warning  im not getting my hopes up or anything   i apreciate it because you do not take the approach of these anons          im not trying to justify my actions with you guys i came for advise on something i know little about being 4chins you get a mixed bag and as i gave the background to the story i thought id share but i can stop if it is off topiic or whatever
  cant help but laugh at the oreos my dude    hope you have better luck next time and remember to not become her bronze prize financial safety net in 10 years
      adorable i think you did a nice job on the wrapping and presentation youve demonstrated that its not so difficult last time i did a gift box like this was when i was helping out with my sister in christmas packaging some crockery with tissue paper and picking out an box appropriately sized and designed  dairy milk  youre a brit right
  cant help but laugh at the oreos my dude  its her favourite chocolate i dont really eat chocolate  i prefer milkshake/ice cream    thanks mate im not going to be a safety net      thanks for the compliment  nope im a saffa   what do they call milk chocolate in the us  looks like the bbc has it out for you lot
id also like to weigh in and tell you not to do this
  do it or dont do it  youll regret it either way but not doing it will lead to much better results
leave it for a girl who loves you back or one you have just started to date she will appreciate it
  you need to tell your plans to some of your real life bros who can physically lay hands on you and stop you  we cant reach you here    though no one wants to admit it we probably all did stupid shit like this when we were younger spoiler it never works
  anon dont do this to yourself the only person who will eat a healthy dose of reality punch in their teeth will be you  weve been there before its just a terrible idea save this all for the next chick who actually cares were just looking out for you anon
also the package is good but save it for the next chick seriously this one is being polite but youre annoying her at this point trust me      this exactly if one of my mates did this irl wed be able to put some sense in him at least      holy chuckles this is accurate
  buddy like all the other anons say let her go i know it feels hard to but you must forget about her if you want to make the box go ahead but give it to someone who loves you that can be a friends family or anyone you look up to they all love you do not waste your talent and effort on one girl you lived your life normally without her before you met her you can continue to live normally even after her distract yourself and forget cut all contact if you want to stay sane man if she went back to an ex whos to say she couldve done something worse i may not know her but its a possibility you must let go
  kill her and the bf
  yeah dont do that
  girls can say the dumbest shit to a guy they arent interested in in the slightest saying the spark or passion isnt there is what couples say right before they divorce why do you think that is what do you think saying that to someone youve never been with in the first place represents this is so painful to see im sure youve already done this and its too late but no matter what she has ever said she does not love you at all you can blame her wormy ex she probably cried and exaggerated to you about blame that it wasnt the time or that young girls need passion but the simple fact is you probably lost this game from the start it almost sounds like you want to wait for her or something awful like that but please dont she probably doesnt think about you anymore  im sorry
hi there just found this crease pattern and can not decipher it can you guys help me fold these two ties
only if you send me the paper
  wym
  i have pdf link right here if that is what you mean 
  theyre not square and i dont have thin enough paper for it if i cut my square in half
reds are mountains blues are valleys
  the best folders section a cp to crack ithere beside its density 4 seems the simplest way to tackle it
it looks really easy what section is giving you trouble
hey /po/ anyone have a as val template or any russian guns
  just buy a real gun faggot
  and dont forget this end goes toward your forehead
    imagine getting mad at a stranger online about papercraft and reacting like this lol
bump for intrest hoping for the fal
anybody that could help me get this paper craft  or a simular design
bump
seems easy enough to make how much does it cost
  
im making my own deer head currently im putting all parts together i have chose to glue it using double side tape to make it more clean in finish but unfortunately tape is keeping to bump away do you have any double side tape recommendation paper that i used for this papercratf is around 250
do u have a template
    xd    yes     im putting all parts together
        there are doublesided tapes that are just the glue layer nothing else they are not cheap and you would need a good store or wellequipped online shop to find them but this is what my deer head the one in the picture and link has been built with
you fake ass hoe youu didnt make that faggot
    thanks for the replay i like this project and im happy that you visit /po/   i was planing to make my own deer head for long time and finally get right size and colored paper   project has some small imperfections in pdf file itself some parts off head are very hard too fold concretely when paper is around 250/300    i was looking for some heavy duty tape but it was hard to apply i was hoping that gorilla duble side tape or 3m could hold all the tension    what is your preferable way of putting model together from the neck or horns
  try me bitch
    i prefer pva wood glue and magnets spread the glue thin onto the paper and let it dry for a couple seconds that way it will easily stick but not seap or smear  use magnets to hold it in place untill it is dry enough about 4 minutes later    wood glue is not as runny as pva glue made for paper
im a complete origami noob how do i get started
start with simple origami like kusudama traditional origami tsuru frog samurai hat    in youtube you will find various origami tutorials i recommend jeremy shafer jo nakashima and tadashi mori    there are many japanese channels with simple tutorials just search 折り紙    once you have learned to fold several origamis search for pdf origami books
  buy paper online or at a craft store worse case make some  search origami for beginners  follow instructions  repeat
  i also thank you since im interested as well i used to do some origami when i was a kid but then somehow i forgot many of them i didnt know its possible
star wars battle droid life size    
good on you anon
woah thats sick
roger roger
i dont think that is the same one the pic looks more detailed than the files provided here is what it looks like completed
    the madman you did it kudos
    whats your plan with it do you want to paint it
    that is not mine it is just an image i got from deviantart
  nice  oom9 was my favorite
um that doesnt compute
  you used to be able to buy these in bookstores when episode 1 came out
dont blow on it
hi /po/ can somebody help me im having a trouble with the step 7
  okay so in the beginning it should look like this
then you open it symmetrically in the middle view from the top
view from the bottom the point on the right is concave if thats not clear  also this looks like benis dddd  ignore the lighter shade of orange it is the same side the other side is white its just not uniformly coloured
  forgot file
now for the action holding the top of the model flat bring the long rectangle on the left upwards and to the right  also now this looks like bagina dddddd
fully brought to the other side the top is now flat but the rest of the model isnt yet
view from an angle on the bottom
fully flattened now
  oops forgot the image again also the post cooldown time is annoying  jewapmoots methods of making you buy a 4chan pass
view from the back legstobe on the right of the diagram
all in all op i think this is a badly designed model that you shouldnt go ahead with while the head looks alright its shape of highly dependent on the precision of the angle of the other outside reverse fold in step 8 it must be 2230 which allows the square you see in step 10 to be perfect also the paper gets quite thick and mine ripped a little while doing step 7 and the single back leg and that tail are pathetic for an origami puppy that looks better and cuter i recommend this one by edwin corrie its simple i think except for the sinking of the top of the head it also has four legs on which it can stand yours should also stand
  well thank you very much anon 
  is that an outside reverse fold or a valley fold if its the former you open the head as shown and crease on top of the layer below using the back of your fingernail repeat this on the other side
  now holding the top of the head like this
  hinge the head downward both sides should become convex and the bottom of the head should open as in the diagram the new creases being made should meet on the top edge with the vertical neck creases
  view from the bottom
during the flattening
in the end the new creases should be perpendicular to the edge here the head isnt square because the angle was not 2230
also in the photo that you posted and deleted which i shall preserve to shame you those flaps over the front legs and the neck should be tucked under the outside reverse fold its quite easy to do that even after the model is done
and to finish it all of here are the diagrams for the other puppy i recommended
put posters and nice things on the walls  live in a wet and cold place  also gets hot when the heaters are on  every 2 weeks all the posters fall down  blu tack either looks solid and not squishy anymore  put them up again  fall down in a few weeks again    is there anything better than this without damaging the walls  i thought you guys will know the pro tips on the matter
  just use tacks anon if its really cold and wet the walls probably arent pristine anyway
  i want to do a kind of posterbomb thing so my landlord will fuck my shit up if i nails the wall  what you said made me wonder will it help if i wipe the area with soap and clean it
just use command strips they can be fairly inexpensive at walmart
  this looks pretty based will have a look at it see how it holds in this horrible climate
  just use thumbtacks
  will it help if i wipe the area with soap and clean it  yes because it will stick the wall rather than the dirt on the wall this is gluing 101  clean the surfaces you want to glue be carefull though if you use soap or alcohol to clean your wall make sure that there is no alcohol or soap left when you put the blu tack this could diminish the sticking performances
  i am pretty sure those will be visible when i remove them maybe there is a way to cover the small holes      makes sense maybe just warm water and a cloth to remove dust and moisture
    out or curiosity what sort of posters do you post up anon
 op    simple solution anon just equip your mystic mud staff and have 2 nature runes in your inventory assuming you have greater than lvl 20 magic use bind
just damage the walls and frame that shit it will look much better too  i thought you guys will know the pro tips on the matter  that sounds more like a /diy/ thing honestly
  water and a cloth to remove moisture
youre in the uk arent you    how bostik blu tac manages to be the most popular brand of sticky tack in a country where the humidity is almost always over 80 is beyond me ive never had any luck with that shit    try pritt or uhu or basically anything white i get the feeling that the blue pigment is just branding and probably degrades its performance
  do you know what double sided tape is
  it doesnt have to be the same cloth
  interesting i never thought of the humidity in the uk to notably affect adhesive tacks ive never had a problem with blu tack  i learned somewhere that the blue pigment is added to emphasise that the tack was not an edible product back when blue colouring in foods and sweets were not a thing
  blue dye has been used in taffy in the us for close to a hundred years
  i see i guess blue colouring wasnt commonplace in here in the uk for a long while living up to the yuropoor meme
  just get borderless picture frames   dosnt make mess and you can swap them with no problem
  how do you fix those on the wall  without damaging the walls  
  i know you said you dont want to damage your walls but if the humidity is that bad your art is going to be damaged anyways get some cheap light frames and hang them properly when your leaving get some drywall patch and fix the holes its cheap easy and as permanent as you need it to be
seconding the cleaning the surface then layer masking or painter tape on the areas that youll be using adhesive to stick the poster the padded mounting tape works best for me we do this for tradefair booths where were not allowed to mark the partition walls hope this helps
  frame and hang like a civilized people    maybe there is a way to cover the small holes  if you cant manage to adult using frames to hang posters use toothpaste to fill any and all small holes before moving
get magnets
  be me  collegefag  move in day during august month  ras pass out free command strip samples  ask them if i can take the rest of the boxes when movein day is over  sure well get more next year  im pretty sure ill never run out for the rest of my life now
  i learned a good trick from organizing small unprofessional art shows get velcro strips get those big bulk ones online that you have to cut yourself and assign one side for the wall and another side for your posters and other things you wanna hang cut out small squares and put them in the corners of what you wanna hang usually it comes with adhesive on the back protected by peeloff plastic velcro strips are pretty sturdy too they can hold my canvas paintings on the wall no problem
  painters tape in loops
  blu tack soaks into the paper over time and ruins the edges whenever i use it    have you tried those big wooden clip style hangers not quite a frame and easy to swap stuff out
who should i watch for origami tutorials
depends how much you already know about origami if youre a beginner i highly reccomend jeremy shafer and jo nakashima however of youre more advanced i suggest reading some books by robert lang that guy knows whats up
if you are into complicated origamis you should take a look at marianozavalaorigami on youtube
henry pham origami sagecarlsson choo
honestly i follow tons of origami youtubers because even those that do the classic simple shit some times post something original    but when it comes to the best of the best so to speak    marianozavalaorigam    adamsara happyfolding    tadashimori    malinda huang    jeremyshaferorigami    jo nakashima    kade chan    origami tutorials    kankichi    bali origami    paperph2 origami    leyla torres origamispirit  
pls someone gimme reference points for this cp
i dont really think you need too many reference points as i see it it all lies on the grid and the diagonal lines are either at 225 angles or are also based on the grid and if not theyre just where they need to be to fold flat like the crimp on the bottom middle it wouldve been better if the cp had the square grid in the background which is 2020 outside the upper corners maybe you can do it yourself on a computer
  so i need to fold 20 grid  noo
  what did you expect
  i was expecting to find the reference for the mid point of cp the rest of the creases will easily fall in place
  the x in the middle is 8 squares from the edge its easy to count
  but i still have to fold a 20 by 20 grid
  use a multiple of 20 cm paper and measure it for the main creases so you dont have to fold the 20x20 grid which shouldnt be a problem anyway if you werent lazy
mark 1/5 on the edge you dont need the whole grid or else the whole model will be filled with unnecessary creases ive folded this model before f16 falcon by jason ku not that hard to collapse and shaping is easy
  what does it represent though
i would box grid it only because you will have a pencil anyway 80 falls on a box grid thereby your collapse should be neater 
  thanks 
here you go     i have only drawn the precreasing so please dont ask me to draw anything further
  well hell youve already gone this far
  haha theres quite a difference between drawing precreasing and drawing actual folding steps maybe jason ku will diagram it himself one day
  it was worth a shot anyway
  jason ku does a lot of odd number box creases5x7x9xand so on  i folded his jewel beetle and box grids the tiniest lines fell on third or half box  with jasons models his schematic diagram helps with the collapse  i was proud of doing that alone  i have a folder full of his cps ill look for the double of this
well gremir closed when i wasnt looking anyone have copies of their novgorad or messina
annnd i messed up the name good job me french battleship messena
  and you still messed it up its massena
  boy i really hate myself right now dont sleep and post
  no thank you im doing test runs on digital navys yamato model currently so far ive got most of 1 of the 46cm main batteries its a pain in the ass cause my computer cant fit the templates properly on the page despite supposedly being designed to work with a4 or letter paper also my printer isnt strong enough to properly print on the card stock used for most of the large components
how do you start folding when there are no instructions only a crease pattern eg robert langs insects and shit
  what do the different colour lines mean
  if you have to ask then you cant do it you have to understand how the model works try to find the diagrams if you can which exist in this particular case but i assume this is not the model you are trying to make if you want to learn more about how the models are designed then i would recommend reading origami design secrets    gray/green ones are mountain/valley folds light gray ones are pleats
  thats not very helpful to anyone       to address your question op you should look for shapes you already know for example if i show you the pic related you might notice that the top left quadrant looks like a crane base this is a good place to start folding then since you know exactly how to fold that     moreover you need to find the main folds the ones that if you were folding from diagrams you would fold early on these ones will allow you to fold the model and keep it folded while you work on smaller modules    basically you look for things you have already folded before and fold those first after that you fold the creases for the others and try to figure out how this works with what you have already folded it takes time patience and experience but eventually you will get there i will bump with some easy cps later
to understand boxpleating this cp might be useful boxpleating is the easiest technique for design and crease patterns but you will notice it is a massive waste of paper and quite meticulous sometimes if you want more like this google boxpleat with origami crease pattern and you will get a million hits
this is allegedly a butterfly but i have not seen a picture of it before its a simple enough cp so i will maybe try it in a bit
this was my first cp i ever folded eric joisels gnome its a great cp to try and there are many common shapes and modules in it that beginners can recognize immediately if you need help on this one do not be shy to ask for help i will be around
  thats not very helpful to anyone   i guess it wasnt a proper answer to his question but he doesnt necessarily have to bother with creasing patterns and definitely shouldnt start with advanced ones like that folding from cp is not a trivial task and i do think that reading origami design secrets is helpful for solving them because it explains a lot of things about model design
they could explain with images what are the different types of cp there are
  i remember doing this one its quite easy
  where do i even begin folding this i wanted to impress my 4yo niece by folding a paper butterfly while we were drawing butterflies together wouldve been nice if i could do this
      try this    the cp is not something meant to be done quickly though the cp is a lot of rabbit ear folds and sinks
  this is another easy one  
  maybe go for a diagram instead of a cp if youre not familliar with origami
  just tried this out didnt work for me started guessing after step 9 guess i will try it again or perhaps try  out
fold the waterbomb base orient it so that the open part is at the top then we fold the left and right top corners to the bottom point
  this is the result now flip it over point still at the bottom
  start lifting the point of the nowtop layer so that it reaches 152cm above the top edge like in the picture
  flatten the corners like in the image after that flip over the piece of paper along the vertical axis just like last time
  fold the top point down along the long edge and then fold it up again above 1/3 of the way from the top like pictured
  mountain fold it in half pictured here
  valley fold along the red line blue line shows you the guide of where to fold to on the bottom end
  result    now we repeat this fold as a mountain fold on the other side so it matches up exactly with the side we just folded effectively this folds it in half
  result now you are done just open it up
  voila
    extra photos if anyone needs a different set of photos to compare to i tried to not rotate it like they did in step 9 so it would minimize confusion
  thank you i appreciate this 
  waterbomb base then squash two triangles the box pleat on the top half looks like its arbitrary
  grey are not pleats theyre not folds at all they are the circle/river packing but showing the actual paper usage
  usually just pick one linetype for in and the other out start creasing and see how it wants to curl up
  circle packing is cool but wouldnt including them in the cp just clutter up the diagram
  warning do not try this with women
  its all just valley and mountain folds
  
could you help me with this one please i need to make a gift for someone and am pretty noobish with cp atm     
  this is a fairly easy cp you need help with references or collapsing 
  with folding actually for starter which color is a crevice which one is a hill where should i start
  blue is valley red is mountain i usually print these out first and try finding references by doing a bunch of common folds and divisions and seeing if anything lines up
  fold both diagnols and mark the angle bisector  this is the reference for the square shape you see in the bottom right corner  rest should easily fall in place
why do the crease pattern makers label which part of the paper will correspond to which part of the model more often like you went through the effort of drawing the whole thing would it be so hard to add some text
we are soldiers of origamithe command is the cp   the drill is finding reference lines  the troop should learn all simple bases and basic angles  45 225 9060 box griding and all bird bases fish bases life bases blintz etc rabbit ears take to understandnow you can begin circle packing which takes years to masterflaps and bisectors  then go back and study cps you got stuck on by splitting the cp into portions which ive successfully understood and folded models from
i think that the hardest thing is not the base  just print the cp and discover the references  but the shaping if the author doesnt even specify which part of the paper makes what then well what do you ever do    are you indian
  yes i is massa
  what did he mean by this
  you are literally on every thread
  what does it matter where im from  if you are a moderator then you have gizmos that can trace ip addresses
i see some of the shapes but i dont know where to start what are the proportions for example with     i see the middle line but then whats the next fold that will give me the right proportions
  i collapsed this now what
  how do i even know if a fold is valley or mountain  looks easy for me but without that i cant do shit
  youre weird
i humbly share byakurens papercraft i think it was never share before        i can also scan suika and yuuka    if someone has meilin ill be more than happy
  thanks anon
based op
i have meiling i would like to exchange for yuka
any interesting diagrams for tiny ass papers
use the diagrams for big paper
download how to make origami and make anything
  depends on the type of paper really regular kami and printer paper offer fewer options than tissue foil and double tissue also its a skill based endeavor less folding more molding at certain points
its like folding thick ass paper thats larger youll quickly come to understand that you arent folding a 2 dimensional perfect plane but something with real thickness
  
  smaller papers work well for nice crisp modulars
  i see what you did there
  cool which model is it
i made a template for the ingame robot for the new nintendo labo game
sorry for the unannotated template i tried placing the parts on the pages in an order that would help determine what goes where but then had to ruin it by playing parts tetris to get everything to fit ill make instructions sometime later if i get the chance
you can build it in a couple of different poses by gluing the joints in at various facets the ankle joints are cut at an angle so you can rotate them to get the feet flat on the ground regardless of pose
top job how did you design it
  coreldraw and basic geometry nodetonode locking and rotation allows you to cheat some of the math the key is to get a consistent front top and side view of the object you are going to create and then manually generate the resultant facet data of each component from that
  this is great i love how youve done the hands figured id share my design of the robo but its a lot simpler than your own
thats damn good im tempted to see if i can modify it so that it transforms into vehicle mode
how close is to the original would scale and cosplay the robot
  i tried using as much photo reference as i could get which was odd because theres surprisingly little available online youd have to significantly alter the proportions to get it wearable but i think it would be doable the joints in particular i kind of phoned it in in order to get them as simple as possible while still allowing for different poses in the build definitely send me photos if you manage to get the template working as a costume id love to see it
this is crazy impressive dude i need to get my printer running but damn i should give this a shot
  cute would it be possible to have a copy of this please
  cute
  its on the nintendoforce site or at least it was i havent checked in a while    you can find out more about the project here  
  its no longer up could you repost it here or your site
  i cant really link directly to it because its client based work but i know its still on the nf site for a fact
im gone from /po/ for a couple months and return for 2 of papercrafts heavy hitters dropping hits christmas already   both these models are suhwheetness
  are there templates for this specific model
  see  unless youre asking for instructions then youre out of luck because jim doesnt normally include them
    sorry to hyjack but this doesnt seem worth its own thread bumping something off    nintendo posted templates for replacement labo parts but provided no scale i know theyre much bigger than standard printer paper but does anybody know what id use or have a converted a4 printable version of the template sheets that when pieced together come out to the proper size
  forgot the link  
    shouldve just made the thread do you really think yours is undeserving when theres countless pol shitposts bumping shit off and 3 tranny shill threads up anyway
  hey its this guy again how you been
  no its not this guy again i have quit worrying about the crap that gets posted in here because it doesnt do any good to say anything anyway  there are other people that dont like a lot of the stuff that gets posted in here besides me
  well its good to see that youre still doing fine its nice having someone looking out for our best interests keep up the good work
yo /po/  im at a loss for resources here i got down how to make a full head helmet how to reenforce it make it purdy but as for making it fit on my damn headhow    any one know of how to make a full helmet piece thats not ment to slip on like a motorcycle helmet latch and fit padding to fit a head takes care of how it would fit snug on my head if i knew of a way to make the front and back latch together without hanging large hardware or hinges off the damn thing    any ideas
magnets lots of them also remember the two pieces power rangers helmets
i cant find any life sized papercraft models of the keaton mask can someone tell me where i can find a print out of this for free
  op here ive come across at least 10 dead links for this its been scrubbed off the internet for some reason
self bump
  ads getting smarter
  theyre becoming self aware
  can someone tell me where i can find a print out of this for free  idk
  hmmmmmm
  hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
      
  wat
  huh

i have contacted the individual who has put together the mask in that image if and when i get a response i will relay that to all of you folks    i also checked various forums for model resources of the mask from the game but could only find models from the 3ds version ill keep you all posted as to anything else i can find
    i used the wayback machine and got a snapshot of the site it was hosted on before it got nuked found a mediafire link that has all the pdfs for the keaton mask youre quite welcome lads    
    thanks so much for your help i love you anons
  no problem pal
  hey man thanks for this
  thank you
any of you have a different pdf mediafire is being a bitch
errr i found it with a google search first page and this is my first hour on this board    
so long time ago i made cs_assault out of boredom  i bet most of 4channers have played cs 16 once in their life so i guess i dont need to explain a lot of it    in the next link there are more pics      and sorry i didnt toke many i accidentally broke it while lifting it from the dining room to my room

in remembrance of the last paper planes thread which just so happened to be one of the oldest boards on 4chan that passed away quite recently this thread will serve as its successor hopefully this thread wont be prematurely bumped into oblivion like the last one did    anyways this thread could serve as a sort of paper planes general feel free to post your designs pdf files and folding instructions anything goes as long as it flies or at least looks like its supposed to
heres a little something to get things started this is one of my favorite origami airplanes books out there origami aircraft by jayson merrill    these designs are pretty kickass in my opinion given how functional they are namely functional landing gear moving canopies on certain models and overall flightworthiness personally my favorite design in this book is the firebat though i strongly recommend trying them all out    protip use the thinnest paper you can find i recommend tracing paper since it is the most lightweight and can give your models superior flight characteristics anything thicker will result in dense stiff and difficulttofold models this especially applies on some of the more complex ones
a bunch of neat designs
  jerry mander  heh
  ah the nakamura lock simple if nothing else
alright fellas heres an archive of all paper models by zio prudenzio lest they go offline like the rest of his website  im missing the reggiane re2005 does anyone have it  and what about raktapakshatrotskiy models i asked in the old thread but forgot to check again for replies on that and now i cant find it on any archives  
  that link is password protected sorry about that heres a fixed version  
  does anyone have a pdf of the plane from porco rosso the savoia s21 i would really like to make it
canons free white wings very good flying characteristics should be made of heavy paper

i want to fold artur biernackis scorpion but i am having a difficult time collapsing the body mostly because i cant find where the mountain and vally folds go
just assume they alternate figure out where that is not true later its obviously a bunch of boxpleating most of which will work itself out
  youre a scrub go fold some easier models first you little fuck
  can you figure it out smartass
  yes i can looks fairly easy now go fuck off twit
  im pretty sure you cant cunt and it doesnt look easy so you fuck off asshole the cp should be marked with solid and dotted lines to indicate mountains and valleys
  looks like pretty basic boxpleating for the most part
  look guys the best paperfolder in the woooorld come back      nope you cant
i found the cp with mountain and valley folds
for modular construction of polyhedra
  halffinished snub cube twelve 9090909090 modules  the darker module at the lower right corner is made from genuine postit notes the others are knockoffs from target
  truncated triangular prism eighteen prototype 90135135 modules
  octahedron six 909090 modules  this looks uglier than it should because its an inverted model but it was made from noninverted modules
  whoops that octahedron is 90909090 modules not 909090 obviously
  nonrotated version
  that is a very nice looking piece of paper   reminds me of people who write math notes quickly but have beautiful handwriting/calligraphy skills and it looks like it was prepared for hours

which one is great for a regular icoshedron

i dont understand
  you mean that one
  i dont understand  well maybe you got stoned on the mary jain again if you forgot already
yes i need this book please
  i do believe its for sale at the origami house joas
  hey anon could you please post a pic of the end of the diagram for the wagtail by yoshio tsuda  i cant see shit on the origami house site and i didnt found any photo of the completed model on internet also i would like to know how many step there is
  here is the wagtail and it has 155 steps
mariano zavala is gonna make tutorial of every single kamiya model even the non published ones like winged kirin and stuff i am sure he is responsible for the delay in wosk 3 i did some research online and found out he is making 550 every month and his channel is growing everyday so this is kinda worrysome  what a snake
  maybe kamiya should make youtube tutorials instead of diagrams then
so here it is   
  wow the wagtail really looks amazing
  whatd i miss
  expired
so ive been making my own custom stickers for a while now but ive run out of ideas on ones to make next anyone got some suggestions here are some examples of ones ive made so far
  there is a board for diy stuff this aint it this board is for people interested in papercraft and origami not stickers
what kind of stickers plain vinyls for anything ive been thinking of making laptop stickers but i want to plan something really flashy and creative    nah i think its okay
  im just looking for any good images  the cheapest way for me is to prepare the image and then print it on large shipping label sheets i then use clear packaging tape to protect the image and cut it outthey work pretty well and hold up nicely  the tape and shipping labels are pretty cheap
    again the top of this board says /po/  papercraft  origami i dont see diy or stickers anywhere in the header youre in the wrong place for this crap
  you arent very welcoming    op i like the images what do you use the stickers for
  at first to put on a laptop but im not sure what else to put them on i also just like the process of making them
nice i also make stickers in addition to origami and the odd papercraft theyre great for applying to papercrafts  deck custom boxes that are made with materials too thick to print on normally too     im always on the look out for good sticker ideas/designs too since i keep a bit of a stockpile of waterproof printable adhesive vinyl sheets and use a silhouette portrait plotter/cutter to cut them
just finished a few more  the way i do it makes them thicker than a normal sticker but only slightly and not enough to be a problem
oh forgot the question a bit designs lol  if youre slightly savvy need to inspect to bypass right click save block on most images or find another work around and you dont mind stealing images that have mostly been ripped off from elsewhere anyway theres a ton on redbubble also t shirt designs and such often make very good sticker fodder
  if this was origami or papercraft related stuff id welcome you with open arms but its not
  its not really harming the board its mildly related and its also a slow topic that would get pushed/bullied off of /diy/ in a day
  its not related at all but im not saying you should get out either im just saying it doesnt belong here
  im just looking for any good images  would be nice if we could upload svgs here i guess the next best bet would be a pdf if to be perfectionist about getting a good print resolution i think i might put together a design in inkscape or something  print it on large shipping label sheets i then use clear packaging tape to protect the image and cut it out  thats cool quite resourceful i might work something out like that with foil/glitter paper stenciling etc
  thats creative you might use a clear coat spray to help further protect the stickers krylon uv resistant spray works pretty good after a few coats

now i just need a party to run it through

  nice one  i hope this thread will stay its still in birthday mode
thats amazing but honestly i think paper terrain and creating a dungeon layout is better in the sense that it gives you flexibility and creating a new dungeon will require a lot of homework most importantly what if the heros just decide to ignore the dungeon all together
  it is already sectional get enough dungeon sections and you can reuse pieces and wait to add rooms until the pcs reach that section
what materials aside from paper did you use because that is epic as hell
what kind of dungeon will we be playing
  inb4 the party completely ignores your dungeon and goes on a tavernburning spree or some other completely unrelated tangent  with love /tg/
chris is a faggot
i like it the sludge especially
  what mobs would you encounter in a dungeon like this
bump
  clean ur room
  now i just need a party to run it through
    make lids or covers to hide the rooms until players actually enter them or are the rooms separable
  draw some skeletons and props on it and sell it for mad  to gameworkshop nerds
  bump
  who doesnt need a dungeon
  they were sections that he would add on when applicable technically this is still an ongoing game possibly because i moved and some other people were buttholes  i ripped out a squids eyeball and made it into a codpiece instead of a bag because i fucked it up  im playing as a tiefling monk solid gameplay  also this is one of best friends work it looks amazing irl  my character is a shrinky dink  also hi op i miss your face
  forgot my caption  i miss playing rogue and being useless except for opening chests and tanking all the traps
  its mostly chipboard hot glue and paint      its a sewer full of bugs and failed experiments       swarms of bugs rats and a giant mutant squid      i flushed them in had a wizard open the floor below them and drop them into it      miss your face too
i am ready
  youre just about a year late but logistics isnt much around here anyway
  i get that a lot
      never too late for dungeons and mayhem
i cant believe this story you are telling me its macabre
is there a better one
is there an archive of zio prudenziattis designs somewhere
of course there are that is if you are willing to pay
  you should still be able to download most of his models if you browse his website through web archive because he had the foresight to host the files on some italian hosting website      but i did also download every aircraft and uploaded them here just in case  
  you are a god thanks very much

oh wait    this fucking thread is from five months ago    that means this board is circling the drain reaching out to me anonymous to save it    i spit in your face board that doesnt even advertise what all rad shit it has i thought all this shit was weebs taping their eyes to their temples and playing pretend 4chan you disappoint me perpetually goodnight newfags
  youre a fucking faggot dude ahahahaha
  eat poo  die  amigo 
i need some more sick stencil designs there used to be this really cool pitbul one on here a while back i cant find it again it was a realistic one of it looking up kinda
  doesnt even post a proper spraypaintable stencil
old thread but as a reminder to any aspiring graffiti artists if youre thinking of using stencils to get up dont you look like a hipster faggot and other writers will always go over your shit first    that being said stencils for any other purpose are cool as fuck just thought id warn anyone retarded enough to think using stencils for graff is ok
  who made you boss faggot
  that looks so fucking cool ill make it on paper tomorrow thanks man
  me this one is me
  these trips are so fucking cool
i used to only see stencil posts on /b/ forever ago  thank you all  pssti know there are some awesome bill murray that work very well
  thisbut better
  zip em and upload maybe
  thats a nice silhouette but it pains me to see that its not proportional
instead of spray paint
eco friendly
  i have this spraypainted on my bin been there like 10 years
anyone got a shimapan stencil
  
  the cringiest bitch to ever live
itd be finicky as shit but the style lends itself plus you can make it spew/say whatever you wanted it to
  stenciling what is it good for absolutely nothin
  huhyeah
/r/ more anime girls
what can i do to improve this stencil
  1 remove all unnecessary details and then some of the kindof necessary details on top of that if you notice it disappear when zoomed out keep it detail is a right bastard to get right so its often easier to smooth over into different larger shapes makes the stencil easier to cut out and more stable to hold/spray around  2 bridges if you want to cut the white bit out to outline around these are the things that keep the thing from tearing apart in your hands since you can just go over it in post obviously if you are just cutting into a piece to spray into the black bits you can ignore this image because youll have different islands to deal with and bridge most would be in the hair ideally make the bridges obnoxiously big and connect a few points together it makes the stencil more stable and harder to miss them when going over it postspray on the flipside smaller bridges like in the hair are stupidly fucking tedious to get right easier to fuck up the entire piece with a slipbut harder to notice if you get it down dots like the ones attaching the hair to the face are shit easy to do add a nice amount of stability and are overall good calls to pepper longer stretches with just remember they exist  3 dont forget you are essentially freespraying when bridging shit so take that into consideration alternatively you can make another stencil with the white added to the black and the bridges as white then spray those inwards be careful however because if you get it 1mm off it looks really fucking weird and disjointed
  if you dont notice it disappear
  thanks famalam
minor dump incoming      fixed it for you
  and sprayed
  and finally a personal project cant dump the stencils now but id be happy to later if someone wants them
  yea this is fake and gay this is some moss art made by a chick call anna garforth the moss is grown as sheets and then its cut out
  that would be cool original content
  branches are an absolute bastard to score careful
  river is an absolute bastard to tack/keep down careful
  actually this is the easiest bit just do 2 coats to cover the red/colour from the river careful with the deer skull if you want to bridge the red bits to form the eye/nose socket i gave up in the end because the cuts were too fine but f you did it on a larger canvas it should be quite easy once youve done the branches
  this is so unappreciated and id like to fix that
    thats not moss its grass grown on turf
  see your own stencil posted from years ago  ha ha ha oh wow
  ive seen this stencil on /b/ like 7 years ago
  hahahahahaahahahaahahaahahhahahhahahaahahaha
what are these stencils used for and how do you use em 
  spray stencils use a scalpel to cut the bit you want paint to go through then spray it on whatever surface  now shut the fuck up and lurk moar newfag it should have been pretty fucking obvious from the guiudes that were posted in the thread already
does anyone here go out and spray some ive tried a few banksys and an original design i print with rasterbator on a lazer printer directly on 250 mic clear binding covers works wonders
  i dont go outside to do it on walls and shit in part because i dont go outside at all but ive amassed quite the small folder of completed stencils  i personally dont mind if my paper stencils are onetime use or not providing they just turn out well such is the way of the poorfag
  i actually need help stenciling a drawing of a boat if you want to help this one is my original design i made this week
  post the pic of the boat and ill see what i can do not too sure how this 4channel shitshow is going to blow over but ill still try lurk my homeboard in my homethread
  soon
  fixed that for you
  hey i made a bunch more after seeing this thread was still up  mods pls no delete
if anyone tries any of these out id love to see the result
hello people do any of you have the pdf of this mask to share

  fuck you you retarded little nigger lover
  your mother may have hit you but dont worry i still love ya
  you sound like a faggot
      please ban this asshole
  not them but they did start a papercraft thread whatever loose connection you consider it it still is relevant content to the board nothing wrong with them asking for templates for papercraft not sure why your getting so angry over them if your legit worried they are trying to do some kinda political baiting then the best option is to either politely ignore them or answer the ops question and only post about papercraft relevant content anything else is just silly
  hitler had blue eyes though i dont understand the amerifat meme that his eyes were brown
  the only one getting assblasted is you    inb4 another 47 replies from this fag about how hes not bothered
  no the racist asshole that keeps coming here calling everyone niggers did not start this papercraft thread  he is just an asshole that likes to get shit stirred up and needs to be banned we shouldnt have to keep reading this crap  if you dont know what you are talking about to start with then dont comment on it maybe you should take your own advise and ignore it
  maybe you should mind your own business and stop commenting on things that dont concern you  this conversation doesnt have a thing to do with you other than the papercraft material that is available to you
    ill give odds of 3/1 that butthurtfag here actually makes it to 47 replies
  ban this sonofabitch

can we have a thread for sexy papercrafts    posting a few pics to spark interest but i sadly never found the files for them
  i might have this one it will take a while to look fpr it though     no body has the op
  i think its a modified version of the already existing maid kagami papercraft  still lmaogeometrical tits
  that model is r18 from the start you just need to be a bit lazy
  a bit lazy why tho      do you habe said model maybe
  a bit lazy why tho  to forget to add her bra or something like that maybe
  yes now i see what you mean im going to have to search my collection pretty sure i have it somewhere
its up on mypapercraftnet btw  its kagami just in case you dont know
  thanks sometimes i wonder why we bother hoarding hdds full of crap were never going to build anyway
  you lack a collectors heart my man  now seriously sometimes it serves a purpose of making sure something doesnt disappear from the internet
  true i had a collectors heart then i looked over my collection and saw zeros and ones but nothing of tangible substance   and to transform the ethereal into the material i dont have the time for so being the owner of vast collection only suits to remind me that my time is limited and i am faced with the reality that i am a slave to things that lack value   what does it pay to have all the treasures of the web if you lose your passion for them and no time to enjoy them or like most of us hoard themfor ourselves    sometimes i think its better to let things disappear dinosaurs after all would seem quite the inconvenience
  im not really too experienced with these kind of things and feelings but i can just tell you this much from what i have been through  a slave to things with no value is not a slave as he doesnt have a master nor chains of speak of in comparison a slave to the material will have to cut his own wrist to free himself  if you have lost passion in your hobby just give it a rest or leave it behind just move on something else there is no wrong in doing that and searching for something else if you have lost interest in your collection there is nothing wrong with leaving it
  lived a charmed life or practiced buddhist     the passion is gone because my energies are allocated to the valueless pursuits im at my worst working at a job i dont care about for people i dont know for money i wont see its very demoralizing im at my best when designing building or talking about arts theres nothing else id rather be doing even spending time on /po/ gives a small boost of dopamine    then i look at the collection and models i want to build and design and well    your perspective of chains is insightful though ill have to think on it over the weekend
  569123    could you post the model please its amazing
  no her top and skirt are separate parts i have this model in my file but ive never built her very sexy though
  i have this kagami but not built  not sure where /po/ falls on lolis but ive got a bikini kobato hagenai on file thats anatomically accurate and cast off  same goes for the upgraded version of whatshisnames life sized mannequin  understandably i havent built either spoilerbecause paper pussies/spoiler though my existing mannequin is in rather poor shape and in need of an overhaul
does anyone have the templates for this model
  bump because holy shit thats amazing
  what would be even more amazing is if someone could come up with the templates for it
its quite a bit like this one but not  
  youre right but not  everyone already has this one  its not an exact replica of the wdw main street castle which is what i am looking for but thanks anyway
it looks like sleeping beauty castle hong kong  to me
  well youre wrong its cinderellas castle in orlando fl
bump still looking for templates please
this is from a papercraft construction book build your own walt disneys cinderella castle amazon has it for 6228 since it is out of print doesnt seem to be any scans since unbuilt books are rare maybe you could buy one and scan it for everyone else alternatively metal earth has a steel model of cinderellas castle if that floats your boat you could even feasibly modify a scanned template and upscale it for a papercraft version
  nah
does anyone have paper pendulum clock kit or pattern i have a kind of kit book but it quality is bad pls share if you have better i really want to make this one thank you
    thank you thank you very much
  how many people actually have the patience to build that shit  also does anyone now the accuracy of this clock 
  no worries man post it if you make it i dont have what it takes
  some man really did it it only need some patience and this clock work real running
  it will take time but yes 
im doing it right now just starting tough  one question if anyone is building it too do we have to make the markings for the scores on piece a05 by ourselves to fit in piece a01
  is the same that a metallic pendulum clock but in paper soooo can give you a real accuracy
anybody knows about other funtional papercraft i want to do more  also here is my progress at least paper 6 tomorrow im gone print paper 7 and 8 2 papers for day  i hope in a month finish  ignore the mistakes im not from usa

  i have the gear cube
  and the instructions
  thank you so much i can made this pieces of the clock and i promise make the cube this is my compromised
well this is my progress it was so hard but im going finish only some details   the piece p1 the piee paper show 5 moldes when you need 6 make a copy  and in the intrucction when you fusion the frame b the sighn of o11 and o10 is it grown but is a mistake of number nothing anymore  about my frame i started without gears becase the gears are little bend the glue deformed the paper so i make a corrections before the fusion of everything pieces  sorry for my grammar im from ecuator
  nice work keep doing this good luck
do not put l10 because with this piece the anchor do not fits with the escapement my solution is put l 10 and l11 together
here goes the weith really for mewas the most confusion step for this reason i made after of all
  good job cant wait to see the end result
i think your paper are too think after your clock finish hope still can move without any destruct
  i mean too thin
  nice
  it is probably in this case im going use stong material  in this picture all the gears stay in situ  the frames suffer the most damage because i needed change for fit the sticks  the only problem now is separate the gears of other gears  and the anchor recomendation do not glue l10 at least not behind of the anchor this piece is a long separate innecesary of the teeth of escapement
amazing work op keep updating us please
nice work  keep updating process pls it very helpful
  what paper are you using if you think its too thick for the mechanism would you suggest using thicker cardstock for the frame and lighter cardstock for the mechanisms im very interested in making this but i live in a shit desert that relies on swamp coolers to fill the air with water and even cardstock warps inside
hello its me the ecuatorian boy  the road to this point was difficult   the frames fuck everything  the space between anchor and escapement her teeth not fits yet  now i waiting for the dry off the glue  and the munite hand i recommend change the step 3 on the step 38 cut one part of the asis  or stick and paste this inside the hole of 12teeth gear type b the little gear front 48 teeth gear   i think so this is the real impulse of minute hand  if you only put the minute hand on the asis this roll without control because the gears more heavy behind them move the asis and the minute hand like light piece move on with the rhythm of the other gears  again sorry for my grammar i started learn with duolingo
hello my dear readers  i belive i am the only who support this thread alive  well now i in stanby for the clock only need rise the asis of ancora everything else is fine and the hour and minute hand goes in perfect sequence maybe later a take a picture  here is the gear sphere cube the first parts it is like a cupcake cover
wow patient man ))) can you take pic about how the clock work how can we run it
this is really cool learn how to make gifs or webm because wed love to see the result in motion
  relax dude im going use format factory transformation video now i make the finals corrections and the pieces of gear sphere wait 3 days or less i promise
dear anon glad to see you build the paper clock i have too started it but stopped a few months ago when my dog ruined part of it my fault i tested the gears after putting the string on the mechanism and left it on the floor this urges me to go back and finish it
  thats incredible anon  good job
  looks beautiful great job anon
    thanks anon i have been looking for this one for a long time now
  59 pages
  the vast majority of stuff in a clock is just crap to display the time  that is almost all the gears are there to divide down the amount of rotation the fundamental accuracy or lack of a clock comes down to two or three main things the escapement the escape wheel  pallets the pendulum and what powers the escapement    the escapement is the most critical piece you have losses due to friction to how the pallets and the wheel interact recoil etc see the fine wikipedia article for more detail with paper you have less thermal expansion to worry about but humidity levels can cause even bigger shifts in size    for more technical details i recommend the books the quest for longitude andrewes ed harvard or watchmaking george daniels
  holy crap anon you are a madman this would be challenging to make as a machinist much less out of paper
  clock looks awesome what weight paper did you use and what are the general opinions on sticking paper together to thicken it
it is so many work maybe before the end of this year i can finish the clock all the problem is the escapement and the anchora the teeth do not fit  another thing you need 50 grames or more for the weith and a stick for more resistence  about the gear sphere i hate make all this axis
  its looks gr8
  looking good so far
  hi op i made this clock about 6 years ago as a gift for my father from your pictures i dont think you have made the gears to a fine enough tolerance are you flooding them with glue too if a couple of teeth are wonky the mechanism will jam as i found out and you will need to use more weight to get it to turn causing the structure to bend    i have also made the gear heart and this suffers from the same problem you need at most a 15mm tolerance on most pieces otherwise it will jam and bend    good luck friend
  e6 is a supporting piece it allows you to mount the eyelet punched piece inside the gear for if you are using a hand eyelet punch if you are using a vertical punch you can ignore it and make the gear completely
  not op but i plan on making this clock what do you mean by the tolerances and flooding with glue
  for tolerances i mean that each tooth needs to be as close to the plan as possible they mesh together very closely you can flood the teeth with glue if you start to get lazy making the gears and try to rush best advice is to glue teeth in pairs at 180 degrees to each other and take it slow good luck
  i see thanks anon
another anon trying to make this here if i make the gears and harden them with a thin layer of diluted glue even if they dont warp will it mess up the tolerances
  you may need to lightly sand the gear teeth to make sure everything fits smoothly the only two pieces that really matter in term of tolerances and fit are the anchor and escape wheel
  nice thanks anon
really inspired by this thread would love to see the end result
super neat
  any progress with this project did you finish it
  not yet dude the ancora is a problem
bump    
yet another anon here thanks for this one guys i just printed layout on flourescent orange/green alternating pieces hopefully i can finish this and show it off here sometime soon
  paper pendulum clock  thanks
thanks again
you need to finish this
good thread
heres the essence of a clock in only a few components 
    why youre using regular papper im always using bristol papper
i dont want this thread to die
  misclick to /po/ instead of /pol/  see this thread  what in tarnation holy crap im really impressed
   to /po/ instead of /pol/
  im rather enjoying my stay id prefer not to see these currently
    but that did make me chuckle so props to you
  mfw it works
this is really cool definitely going to attempt it    this thread is two years old
just doing this right now and im wondering  in the diagram for the 20 tooth gear it appears that the gear front and back go through the outline of the teeth do i need to cut a flap for that or do i just assemble it like the other gears
  go through c6 has extra bits that you fold over onto the teeth on each side but that gear is constructed kind of strangely
  did you ever have any success with this anon
koakuma kunny
  it does look cool but looks way too complex for me ive barely done any papercraft to begin with
hey
  this is cool
  bump because i dont want to lose this
  im so tired the pendulu is very difficult and yeaplike 3 years and i cant finish
  hang in there anon i believe in you
hope you can complete it one day somebody has to archive this thread 
  damn i wanted to build it when i read your replies now it seems impossible
bump
  you can do it op  ganbate
  do it lad by the power of wishing energy i believe in you

my girlfriends birthday and id like to make her thisim stuck on the collapse and ref points
  as winter draws in it seems all the cuckolds and doormat guys who profess their love and try to impress them with cheap gifts post on this forum  does she even like you   wouldnt some expensive adult treat impress her more
  i have university debts i cant really spend money on something and havent asked her in any case
  you are a sorry person  where are you having the problem
anon  the reference points took me three hourssome of the tiny lines are thirds of a plane    im tired of trashing paper the collapse is awkward and i only can see three borders
theres no shame in printing out the crease pattern and tracing a few lines to serve as reference points
  thats a great schemeive yet to get add ons though but to practice portions of a cp it makes financial sense at 15 p a copy i am not at college  have no a4 printer
568352  did you box grid to find reference points
this is what i folded obviously more a insect head than inlayed hearts
  you can display the cp on a tablet screen and put a piece of paper over it and mark only the most important reference points
 you telling me i have to draw another one  im not on a tablet either
  show me what you got
ive posted my attempt please scroll up
  youve got the basic idea of the colour change but i can see the sides of the hearts is where your confused
this isnt even a good heart design its the type of thing a 12 year old would make at least make something more aesthetically pleasing for her
  for a 12 year old the folding sequence is pretty complexshe likes stickers and cutesy things iim on the right track with thisive printed a bunch of photocopies to practice with
  who dates 12 year olds  when i see a heart i automatically dont think of underage girlsyou are a sick person
nice op
  heres the reference and the precreasing that i would do to fold it    i cant help with the shaping as i havent folded it yet
thanks for participating  if you read the intro you undwrstand i only am having trouble with the collapse which maybe in finding the references and making the paper it made everything too fragile to graspit feels like a limp piece of iceberg lettuce in my hand
  thank you thank you thank you it does differ from mine but i cant see the sink lines there is a major one in the middle
  the problem with a lot of crease patterns is the draughtsman dont want to draw attention to themselves with giving too much free tutorage   on this example not only do we not know the subject as we look at itbut we have no direction regarding the limbs arms legsheadhairapr indress details boots  if you were to post a photograph of the model as we look at it
568771
i think this is actually really thoughtful op update us on how she reacts to it
thanks for the idea op i just made these two for my gf which one should i give her
  luckily since its her birthday in a few weeks and not valentine i scrapped the red one for a more appropriate paper  i actually cant really see what youve made there but me being a new age man know red isnt every ones colour
look at the bottom fold the border is right but the cleavage wants reversing
568782  thats the uppermost portion of the cp   cock breath
  the top one
  this reference chart helped me and gave accurate lines than the few attempts id binned  im nearer to cracking itbut am not certain about the sizes of the inner hearts  heres what i got after playing with it today
you might want to spin it around as my camera has no auto rotate
  she really liked it btw she stuck it on her wall
  great choice there  how would you like to make two girl friends happy and literally help me with this subject
  not to be rude but if youre still having trouble after a few weeks it might be time to pack it up and go for a more simple design     sometimes simple is better but i guess you know her more than i do how much progress have you made so far
  look at this sad pathetic lonely idiot if youre actually serious im so sorry that you dont have the motivation to make something for your partner if you even have one and instead think buying some chink made trash or taking them out and showing them how little you value money by blowing it on shit food is a better way to convince them youre the right guy for them    the heart is a bit gay but still props to anybody in this thread who actually puts in effort to make things not everyone has money but everyone has the ability to do shit like this it dont make you a bitch cause at the end of the day shes still gonna suck your dick and the only salty kids on the block are gonna be the fat virgin neckbeards who are jealous and angry at the world just sayin
  exactly a thoughtful gift is better than an expensive one if a girl doesnt like it then shes not the girl for me some of this origami shit isnt easy either
  ive got the centre heart and its borderive been playing around and it looks as if i should have folded the outside border the turned over and folded the bottom to the middle
  i have already made her origami flower once while waiting for her outside a changing roomit was like half an hour and i got feel ups that night
as close as a few weeks away and im still not completed
maybe you remember this from the origami gifts thread but last year for a secret santa thing i gave these models to somebody as a gift now christmas is approaching again and i want to be ready in time with some really impressive models ive purchased for this occasion a 4040 cm sheet of origami shop red tissue foil so not the actual tissue foil made with foil but it still has its properties a 4545 sheet of green sandwich paper the real tissue foil and a 4848 sheet of dark green elephant hide i would like to make among others the following models  eric joisels dwarf probably from green homemade tissue foil not the one from the shop  robert langs murex from white tissue foil made by myself  some kind of impressive dragon im not sure what to choose between jo nakashimas devil dragon kade chans fiery dragon 20 or tadashi moris darkness dragon i definitely want it to be complex but not ancient or western dragontier  what other suggestions do you guys have i want to give about five or six models in total i want to keep them reasonably complex or sophisticatedlooking i have access to plenty of pdfs of origami books and of course youtube tutorials and i dont need to exclusively use the papers ive bought although the red tissue foil could be reserved for the dragon also being able to make small sheets of tissue foil at home which i wouldnt prefer because they are very uncomfortable to fold with
  if youre uncomfortable with tissue foil try double tissue instead  2 sheets of tissue glued together with methyl cellulose this paper is awesome    as for impressive but not so complicated models here is some examples i personally like   fox by hoang tien quyet  horse by roman diaz  pentagonal rose by naomiki sato  pegasus 20 by satoshi kamiya most difficult of the list  rat by eric joisel simplest one
  thanks for the suggestions also nice rat  for some reason people make some really bad looking rats that everyone likes but yours actually almost looks like something eric joisel would have made  also since theres a high probability that the recipient will be a girl ill have to avoid things like rats roses or insects by the way
  well actually the bad looking rat everyone make are copies of the rats eric joisel made just look at the diagram but they are not really bad looking i just think that the rat was intended to have a pretty strong cartoonish style i wanted to do something more life like so the shapes are rounder the snouth has more realistic size etc the face is still quite long and thin though     for the girl part  just say its a mouse nobody will question that also if theyre more than 6 and if the origami is dope i dont think theyll mind the fact that it depicts a rat or an insect however i recognize that offering an origami rose to some girl you know might come off a bit cheesy
  holy shit is that the flower tower    much respect yo ive never been able to finish it
  flower tower  finish  just make a single layer and call it ready
  for some reason despite the fact that i always fold the flower tower from the same type and size of paper the results drastically vary sometimes i cant get past the second layer sometimes the accuracy of the folds is really bad for no reason also the most annoying thing is in the top layer sometimes one rabbit ear is not precisely folded and it sticks out from the bunch and then the upper tato has the tendency to easily bust open and good luck making it stay closed after this happens a few times
okay im bumping my own thread now
dude dont make a dumbed down ripoff of the ancient dragon just make the ancient dragon    wait  no  make a ryujin
on a more serious note how about roman diazs hippocampus its kinda pretty but quirky too
  where do you get your paper dont know where to get large square sheets for the complex folds i really want to do tessellations specifically the hydrangeas i like youre clover i was able to do the rose tessellation with just office paper but never got past three by three
  origami shop i mentioned it in the op if youre asking about the paper of the models in the picture theyre all coloured printer paper except for the dog which is homemade tissue foil
  really love the one on the left
do any of you know how to diagram origami is there like a graphics package to notate it digitally or is the only option doing it by hand a fucking nightmare
  dear anon truth is there are no shortcuts no matter which software you choose the point stands you have to draw each single step    this being said i used inkscape you may want to try dia or any software with vector graphics support    it takes forever the final model image is not a drawing though i took a picture and traced it
  try the treemaker
  thats not a diagramming tool though
  dont diagram diagram is for noobs cp shows the true skill of a folder
  drawnings are clean but why are you using this s shaped path  and why didnt you put any text on the diagram 
  not that anon who uploaded dragonpdf but sshaped diagrams are easier to follow  just walk along the path as you fold  of course regular lefttoright and toptobottom diagrams are often appreciated because thats the usual way of reading a book in the western world  to each his own  as for no text that isnt really needed when diagram is clear and not targeting total beginners
thanks for the diagram i made the model i like it
  those fucking nails
  fucking hell cannot unsee
  oh you cinnamon roll
lets fold together i am folding models from this book for fun probably in order come join in ask for help if needed and help out if you can
angelfish no harder than a crane
seal pretty easy for beginners
walrus a few more folds than the seal
so where is the starfish
  i will make that in a minute i had a busy day
  starfish messed up the final squash but you know only can go up
  not too bad  that asymmetric squash can be a pain to fold neatly indeed  i usually display the other side up which is usually a bit cleaner and symmetricallooking
  yeah i find it is usually a gamble whether i can do it with kami with a piece of lined/printer paper i can do it fairly regularly
crane i like this model the best so far
  what about the swan  its an easy one and it has legs which is rare for an origami swimming bird
  the point of me stopping is to let other people try some models (((    by now i have done most if not all of these throughout my life time
  here is mine with a small paper
  looks great
  took me long enough to find time to do it
tried out the angel fish not that hard but pulling it all out at the end was a little bit of a pain
  good fold
  folded the eagle now it is okay but got a little thick at the neck so the kami split with the crimp
  the owl is also good
im having trouble on step 17 with the bear i cant tell what type of fold im supposed to make
  it is a mountain fold of the topmost layer which happens to pull and tuck the corners of the circled coloured layers under the edge of the paper    if you need more help i will help you tomorrow with a little photo diagram if this isnt sufficient of a tip
need to get some bigger origami paper this was tough 
  looks cute
im a scrub and cant figure out whats happening between steps 6 and 7 on the swan the folds in 5 dont appear to leave enough paper to do the valley folds in 6
  in step 6 the central part between the 2 folded points is being pulled down you can see the final edge created by this move in step 7     on related picture that final edge is green  the blue part on picture 6 is probably the edge that annoy you for this step it will go down to where the blue part is in picture 7    hopefully that will help you a bit i cant make pictures right now  but be sure to ask again if it isnt clear enough
  that makes more sense to me thanks ill have to start over from scratch since things have gotten a little crumpled but ive got the general idea of the fold  forming it is more 3d than i was thinking    thanks a bunch friend ill ask again if i have any more questions 
  sure ask again if needed  and please post a picture of the model once youve finished it
    so anons where are you now from there
tfw complete beginner and folded a walrus  this is a happy thread
  congrats should post a pic
im attempting to fold the eagle and have an issue whenever i hit step 4 the areas i scribbled in pic related are not the inside of the sheet for me but are the outside i dont understand the instructions super well anyone can give a more detailed explanation for more of an amateur
  before you reach step 4 you should make the detailed wingfold sequence that is described in page 15 of the same book have you done that correctly if yes in step 4 you simply insideout the two little gray triangles at the bottom not the white ones that are the back layers
  i guess i didnt push in the back sides corners enough thanks for that
how do you do step 4 of the brontosaurus base
  nevermind i was an idiot
i cant seem to understand what exactly is going on here    could anyone make a few photos to show me i really cant imagine how the tusk is turned/unfolded to have white side surface
  hahhhahha disregard me i suck cocks    its just unfold the top layer fold the other way  the arroes are misleading imo
damn the reverse fold on the tiny bits are a menace need to make a bigger one and with thinner paper then it will be smoother and less crumpled
t rex
literally my first origami book  thabk you for reminding me of its existence op
probably a dead thread but whatever heres my shitty brontosaurus from shitty paper
snake
    looking good    by the way no thread is dead on /po/ axiomatically speaking that is
    a complete amateur with this stuff and im about to try the eagle but theres something i dont get already in step 1  it says to get half of the brontosaurus done omitting steps 2 and 3 so that means as soon as i have the preliminary fold i just do the squash fold and im golden   and printer paper is viable to make everything from the book right mostly worried about the size
  printer paper is viable to make everything from the book right    if you try hard enough yes    pictured a lobster made from cheap art paper
  it says to get half of the brontosaurus done omitting steps 2 and 3 so that means as soon as i have the preliminary fold i just do the squash fold and im golden  it means you dont fold the triangle from step 2  3 and you only fold steps 3 4  5  basically thats what you wrote    and yes you can fold all of that books models with plain copy paper the result may not be pretty and/or durable though
    thanks a lot will try some stuff later in the day then more than durability im looking for a relaxing moment folding paper so it will do
  if you manage to finish the fold could you share a picture of your result
  havent finished yet between the wing fold steps 37 which i cant simply understand and no matter how i fold they simply dont feel correct theres also the problem like that other anon with step 4 from the main diagrams   im trying to fold a few steps every day but its simply difficult to get going from that point
    pic came out worse than expected but right now im around step 6 of the wing fold while having done already the previous steps from the main diagrams of the eagle just simply cannot grasp how to continue with steps 6 and 7
  sink the flap valleys become mountain folds
  so like pic related is ok   if 5 is good then how about 6 it requires to fold twice but from where to where exactly added some colors in case of reference needed since i cant see how 6 becomes step 7
  try to sharpen that aqua corner    now what youre supposed to do to make your life easier    fold the aqua corner to top that will make the right valley fold    from there find the intersection of that fold and the center crease     make a valley fold that reaches from the intersection to the aqua corner    then just follow the creaselines to step 7
  wow thats pretty clear thanks now after so much i could finally see the resemblance between the diagrams and the paper guess its time to finally go for the main dish
woops went to sleep without putting this first  so the paper was heavily damaged and the piece started to become unstable as soon as i lifted it up to take the pic the techinque was lacking and the folding was subpar in the sense that it couldve had finer creases  but overall it was a pretty interesting model to do and at least managed to do it with printer paper so that at least is nice   thanks anon that helped me through the process was planning to do it through the week one or two steps at a time but ended up finishing it today
  that owl looks disappointed at me
on step 12 of this seal i have no idea how to do this crimp fold im still really new to this any tips please
  well there is a little error in that step it isnt written but you need to fold these 2 folds valley and mountain on both sides at the same time  basically   pinch the right part of the model the neck near the bottom with your right hand and insert your left thumb and left forefinger inside the belly   then opening the two fingers from your left hand spread open the belly   now push the body layers to the right as to cover your right fingers those are still pinching the bottom right part of the model   youve rotated the bottom part of the model which is the goal of that step   fold flat everything well that means mark both valley and mountain folds and youre done  hopefully that would help a bit
  this is what it should look like after doing the fold
  any news did you manage to fold that step
john montroll is harder than novice but not advancedit is intermediate correction
  lol what
fucking noobs
havent folded in a while how do my starfish look guys i think i messed the flatten part it was a small shit paper though
  looks great
  oh yeah no printer paper will fuqq you up  made this using i think 30x30 shiny red foil paper i bought a looong time ago  really no idea what it is but it turned out pretty good    reasonably easy model to work with i tried a horse using the same paper but it was too thick even for a mediumcomplexity model
  nice paper choice color and texture wise  earthy brown greyish white and an almost hairy texture
i folded the tyrannosaurus  im just getting back into origami after having done very little of it in the past 56 years
  cute cherryblossomed trex
  why does my fivesided square always end up looking like this with the bottom triangle partially under the big upper triangle unlike in the diagram where they touch corner to edge
  probably because you messed up somewhere before step 4  be sure you crease where and as indicated in the first 3 steps this is what gives you the right proportion for the rest of the diagram
  diagrams are the ideal but in reality you are constantly fighting with the tension and thickness of the paper and submillimeter imperfections that can either help or harm  it looks like there are several creases meeting at that bottom right corner since you need a fraction of a mm leeway these corners can creep away from the ideal  its usually fine especially if youre squashing that point it should come in handy
  im new here but what da hell is 5side square 
  read book attached to op post you might learn a things or two
  a preliminary base with one extra flap
  can you like film this not in a cave please lol
can i join the fun
  the more the merrier  cute face
  different anon also stuck on this step a nice webm/gif of how to do it would help the other one posted is too dark for me to make out what he did
  check page ten of the pdf anon
    kekd at and with your meme
  how do you get it right im using a cut printer paper how far should i be from the middle with the triangle tip
  how do you get it right  its trialanderror  look at attached picture and try to get the crease line from step 3 which is like put a on b to get through the left corner of the orange triangle  when youre done you can keep on folding the model
  page 10 is how to do a petal fold and i am well past that step and it isnt even required for this fold
  page 7 of the book page 10 of the pdf
  heres a pic of how its supposed to turn out from a better angle
  checked
  that came out wonderfully
  hideo komatsus horse
hello guys just dropped in on the thread and was wondering are we folding strictly from ops book or could i fold from another artist
issei yoshinos salmon
here is a turtle i just doodled
holy hell that horse and salmon i cant even understand the instructions and that size is unreal     heres my attempt at the eagle as well 15cm x 15cm felt a bit too small for the last few folds
im having trouble understanding passage 910 of the eagle im not sure how im supposed to unlock nor what its supposed to look like afterwards
  the man who wrote this book taught me geometry and calculus in high school he was interesting
  stories please
  he was certainly one of the most bizarre teachers and for reference this was at an all boys catholic school so the baseline was pretty weird his method of teaching was to simply hand us packets and have minimum involvement preferring to let us work through the packets ourselves that was actually pretty nice    certainly one of the strangest experiences we had with him was when the class below collected all of their geometry packets and put them in a trash can they lit it with lighter fluid on school grounds and melted the can i later heard they mentioned this during their graduation and he left the auditorium crying    in general he was just a strange man i actually dont have much interest in origami i just came on here because i know hes a prolific author if you have any other questions feel free to ask but ill leave you with one more    be me in geometry  he leaves the room for some reason  its late in the year sometime during the spring  one of the windows is open and his desk is unattended  working together a couple other boys and i lift his desk up and place it outside the window  go back to work  he comes back a minute later  looks around and in a flat monotone voice says  it looks like my desk has gone i wonder if i leave if itll come back  he left  we put the desk back  he came back  oh the incredible moving desk
montroll is an odd guy indeed but thats true for a number of origamimakers i suspect
  hottest man alive
  wow thanks for delivering did he do anyhting involving origami did he ever mention it to students did you know about it
  we knew about it yeah on days where we didnt need to do anything hed bring in some of his origami books and origami paper and teach us how to fold i remember making a crane following his book that flapped when you pulled the tail hes a good guy
  that is exactly how he does his classes at the origami conventions
  oh the incredible moving desk  probably the best way to handle the situation imo    thanks for the storry anon
need a bit of urgent help with the starfish i dont quite understand step 3
  check 
am i retarded
  dont worry mine is even worse and i had to throw it away because it made me depressed
  thats a beautiful book anon thank you very much
made all these 3
  forgot image
  wow you guys are so talented i wish i could be like you
  you could if you just bothered to train
  fuck that pose is perfect
  creepy
 op  i deadass just got this book for christmas what a trip man    folded this boi last night fell asleep before posting      talent isnt a thing it doesnt exist just practice        the first try is usually ass look how derpy my bears head is gotta make it at least a couple times to really figure out how all the proportions work
  ty for the book
trying to make the spider how the fuck do you go from that to that
  wait just figured it out
what makes special origami paper better than usual paper you use to write on or from a printer
  lots of things actually tere is a very wide range of origami paper with an equaly wide range of properties so what ill say doesnt hold for every origami paper but   its thinner printer paper is 8090g/sm origami paper often goes to 4050g/sm and can even go down to 2030g/sm   its stronger origami paper often has long natural fibers which makes it stronger  more tear resistant and fatigue resistant  its bigger almost every complex origami model need to be folded from a bigger square than 21cm  its nicer colored paper color sided paper sometime with a nice a nice texture to imitate leather skin fur etc  its less springy than copy paper and crispier you dont realize that copy paper is springy in every day use but if your origami model has too much layers it tends to open and unfold by itself the fact that origami paper is usually thinner and has more seizing in it tend to reduce this problem some origami paper even have a metalic foil sheet inside them to help the paper staying in place this also help modeling        oh hai doggy 
i probably needed bigger/thinner paper but i am delighted with these models
  took me a while too
made eevee today i hope pokemons are allowed
  well it is a cute model but this topic is supposed to be about folding models from ops attached book montrolls animal origami for the enthusiast  what about starting a pokémon thread though
  i love origami but never do it but today i felt like it so heres my little snek attempt
  gorgeous
  very cute im going to have to get some more paper soon and try out all these fun designs
forgot this thread even existed
  hi ive been trying to make this seal for awhile but i got stuck on step 12 how exactly do i make the crimpfold and repeat it behind
  you dont repeat behind for step 12 its a crimp fold which involves both sides i tried to explain it using the picture showing the zig zag pattern of the crimp for either side of the paper
  thank you anon ive managed to do step 12 but got stuck on step 16 again  i ended up finishing it but my seal got cramped back legs
  step 16 the flap goes in between the paper kind of like a penis
thread is moving so fast no one will notice im gay
  its been here for more than an year damn
  lets fold something
  i did
  i just started with origami and i have problems understanding the diagrams sometimes
  no fuck off
made the spider pretty cool lets see how much it can be improved through shaping
hello everyone i know this thread is a bit old but i stumbled on this book and tried to do a few of the models im stuck on stage 18 of the walrus i have no idea how to do those kinda squared legs
  that legitimately gave me a small startle
  pull the hidden layers out
    hi anon you get square legs if you pull out the inner layers of the triangular legs look at the first walrus pic in this thread you can see that the crease/fold of the two layers on the legs
  thanks a lot  it still looks a crappy too many tries on bad paper so i wont post it here but it did work out in the end 
sometimes after lusting after complex realistic origami models i start thinking that maybe for simple people who dont know much about our art models like the ones in this book not very abstract but still with obviously visible creases and pointy geometric edges are more impressive than even highly complex designs because they do realise that these models are folded from a single sheet of paper while they cannot comprehend the same fact for realisticlooking designs
  i dont know what the fuck is going on in the elephant step 28 i got the paper to look like step 27 but what the fuck is step 28 trying to indicate
anyone have steps for semirealistic crocodiles much like the style of roman diazs little frog/toad
  semirealistic crocodiles  something like this 
  thats rather realistic actually you have the instructions for it looks way too complex compared to the little frog tho
  too complex  what did you mean by too complex  wait a minute what did you mean by semirealistic crocodiles  how realistic you are looking for 
  yea i was vague in my descriptions i would consider pic related semirealistic for a frog/toad
im interesting in seeing /po/s best work
here it is a 11000 scale origami rock with full detail
folded this one just now
me too
  seems like a pretty complex fold pattern
this was my first time shaping with mc i loved the whole process i used a double unryu paper for it it looked beautiful when it was done drying up
  thats insane
  pdf please
  
post more amazing stuff faggots
  wow thats impressive
for those who havent found it    its also present in one of satoshi kamiyas books
first attempt at hideo komatsus horse
  kek
  nice one anon if you like horses you should try the one of roman diaz less steps but more modeling though    am i the only one here who start a lot of origami but is too lazy to finish modeling  pic related
all these books shared in the sharing thred and no one post his work      you guys arent just collecting massive amounts of books and never folding anything right 
it took ages to glue on the pattern
lafosses banana slug
  pretty nice  whats the name of the model 
a collage i made a while ago most of the works here are satoshi kamiyas models
  forgot the file
  would render much better with nonmetallic paper eg wizard praying mantis even mammoth tusks 
see all the amazing shit  i just do paper hats
i löv you blini
tedious
  fuck you i hate spiders
ive always made paper cranes from any scrap paper lying around like in a boring class or out of my bus ticket ive made hundreds i started making them when i was around 11 and im almost 15 now there are lots of paper cranes ive made hidden down my street sadly i have no idea when ill get to 1000 cranes maybe i already have so i might never be able to make my wish
  satisfying af
  not really satisfying its full of little imperfections because i was too lazy to do the diagonal precreases to be fair it wouldve been terribly boring the square grid is 4848 but it made it look superficially cleaner
  i think its called a giraffe
  i do exactly the same thing except ive been doing it for 10 years crane on man crane on
i tend to make an awful lot of these rats by eric joisel
a cute duck i made
a dwarf unhappy with the face though
selfmade man by eric joisel again the face sux
    really cool dude
  bear or wolf
pegasus from a single patterned sheet of karape approx 70cm70cm
the standard dwarf by eric joisel
mockingjay    i thought it was a dog
  i dont like the tail    are the feet unfinished      i dont like them    i dont like the paper but it looks wellfolded    i dont like the face    i dont like the paper but i really like how the model looks
   i dont like the tail   are the feet unfinished  i cant get them to stay in the right shape   i dont like them  not really satisfied with em either though i like the way the legs and trousers of the joker turned out    i dont like the paper but it looks wellfolded  thanks yeah its just a really cheap type of wrapping paper dont really have the money to spend a lot on fancy papers    i dont like the face  i do     i dont like the paper but i really like how the model looks  thanks its a3 printer paper cut square iirc the model can be found on youtube
      i think you should spend more time trying to fold things neatly and modeling you origamis it seems that youre using kraft paper if so there are some better paper that would improve the rendering of your models      folding looks good but i think this pattern doesnt work well with the model you should also try to wet finish with methyl cellulosis if you have if not you can also use plain water the parts where the paper unfold itself at the legs for example you could also use glue dont be afraid to use glue every good folder you see on the internet use glue for their models
   i think you should spend more time trying to fold things neatly and modeling you origamis it seems that youre using kraft paper if so there are some better paper that would improve the rendering of your models  yeah its more or less like thin kraft paper i might buy some better paper in a while   i think my bases are usually quite accurate but i dont know how to properly model / finish them ive tried folding a couple of bigger faces with the same amount and shape of flaps that are available in the dwarfs but that didnt work out all that good either    folding looks good but i think this pattern doesnt work well with the model you should also try to wet finish with methyl cellulosis if you have if not you can also use plain water the parts where the paper unfold itself at the legs for example you could also use glue dont be afraid to use glue every good folder you see on the internet use glue for their models  i used lots of methyl cellulose on most of the other models used a bit on the pegasus to keep the legs in more or less the same position   wouldnt i need way thicker paper for water shaping to work what   im working on pictured phoenix atm will try using glue and methyl cellulose to shape it properly i intend to film burning it and to reverse the video
forgot the phoenix wip pic maybe not entirely appropriate for this thread but whatever
  there are 2 separate things    wet folding is using a wet heavy 100g/sm usually paper that you dampen and fold while it is still wet generaly you would only use plain water for that    wet finishing is using a usually thinner paper you fold everything dry when come the moment of shaping the model you wet the part you want to shape you shape the part and then you hold it in the shape you want until its dry this can be do e with simple wather but is usually better with a bit of mc
  thats terrible its upside down
hideo komatsus japanese macaque  second attempt
  nice one anon it would benefit from an adapted color sided paper though    what paper did you used 
  its a 110 g/cm2 kahari  definitely gonna try to do it 2colored
thats my last one
  second attempt to make magic ball first time took about 4 hours before i failed at gluing it together in the end
fox
  i feel like you choosed the wrong orientation of the paper nice little doggy appart from that
  thats right i realized already when i was finishing the model but thanks
  i have tanteida magazines from 36 to 136 and i have never done any model
  i loved it
  wow nice how tall is it
  the size of a two liter bottle
made it for my gf on valentines day
  i like the leaves is it a kawasaki rose  i cant tell from the picture also did she like it 
  thanks its the new kawasaki rose aka angled kawasaki rose and yes she loved it
came out shitty but first attempt with both design and paper
  not sure why it was upside down
  i think it turned out pretty darn good
  youre from downunder  d
  holy shit
  heres my first attempt at jason kus origami nazgul it was using some shitty craft card 25cm so it was more of a test run got a 60cm one i have been meaning to finish for years
  this is the first piece of origami i made that i was proud of 5 intersecting tetrahedra making some stellated icosohedron iirc
  great work did you think of that yourself or is there a guide i think id like to something similar now
  that would make great dd monsters
  its from this book i have a scan of it somewhere it was in that big 16gb mega origami torrent ill try and get just that book uploaded when i get home
    page 235   meganz /vri3dbjjg3hf_n46b4c5isv8wdulc2om91myifipiuul9pj08
        it all comes from here anyway thomas hull website  
    crease pattern plz
  if it is not that one thats a close variation
folded a ryujin 21 a while back head still looks like a mess so ill prob make a second one
  i like it i think the scale of this one is perfect      really nice work i made this pug for my gfs birthday      looks like an absolute nightmare to fold im very impressed
  this is such a nice relaxing model to make i have 3 or 4 of them but its a bitch to put together without the webpage really fun puzzle to work out  sadly you cant do much else with the units beyond making other eq triangle faced solids as far as i can see
  can you share the file
      youll need pepakura to open the pdo file that i linked the pdf template is attached but i absolutely do not recommend going at it without the model open in pepakura    it took me about 20 hours to build but it was my first time with papercraft 10 to cut and crease all the pieces and 10 more to construct everything
  looks awesome i like the pattern
  it looks like an adaptation to jo nakashimas wolf    
first attempt at robert j langs butterfly
  whats the name for that type of origami
  i love this did you find a book by eric joisel or an internet source      also great work do you have the pattern      those leaves are crazy i hope she loved it      this is absolutely wicked im jealous the scales look like they took forever      this is a first attempt at a dragon i made a few days ago following this video by jo nakashima 
  the dwarf is just joisels usual dwarf the one with the partial cp
  this ones a tessellation although one of the recursive would this be the right word kind and not the tiling one
  box pleating
  isnt that just a crumpled paper am i missing something
  nope theyre all trolling ya its very obviously crunched up paper
  i have the link of video the video of how to fold it   
  the cp for that one is pretty complete he even added some shaping instructions iirc
  are you from germany
i enjoy modular stuff like this because its relatively simple to make but the outcome is pretty impressive
  im interesting in seeing /po/s best work  then youve come to the wrong place nothing but amateurs here
  but sometimes also tidious i need like 12minutes per piece and at 400count could end up with 14 hours or as i did multiple years because youre lazy as fuck
  m interesting in seeing /po/s best work  then youve come to the wrong place nothing but amateurs here  whoever /po/s people are and however they are skilled there is a best work it may be a crappy piece of scrap it may be a masterful piece of art but best doesnt imply a good quality its only relative to local /po/ work
  now thats fucking neat
  so just trashing up the place
aunt made a dragon for me
brian chans fiddler crab fun fold with a nice result so long as you have decently thin paper
  hi mech_tech
  hello
  yeah the joke
i havent folded anything in five years i was into origami for a few months and this is the best thing i ever folded a rat its printer paper so i couldnt fold that many details and it doesnt hold the right shape if i pull the tail back arms in and head done with my fingers it looks better it always looks worse in pictures for some reason
  i like this rat the ears are nicely built maybe you should get back into origami
  why do origamists and papercrafters alike hate golden venture folding
  probably because its objectively shitty
  my dude  its almost insulting how its become the face of origami to the uninitiated if you search origami on google you see a bunch of those
  nice im looking to get into the origami business any tips
  hurr durr well first you gotta learn the yoshizawarandlett diagramming system and then you have to read origami design secrets cover to cover and then buy 50 worth of thai unryu paper from origami shop  just watch tutorials on youtube as always recommended channels jo nakashima happyfolding jeremy shafer tadashi mori start with happyfoldings simple playlist
grane wid benis dddd
  i really dont like that model its way too complex for what it offers probably the hardest 30step model ive ever tried step 19 is a nightmare and im no stranger to complicated steps like that one
  nice    i dont remember the steps for this and i do wish i was able to squeeze out more legs i believe its based on crane base years have gone since i have done anything origami now that im older i think i have a better grasp on shaping vs adding details when to add those details and how extrusions are created i never understood how people got so many extrusions to make bug legs or spiders for example now i conceptually see it as a paper area trade off usually involving squash folding    i dont think printer paper is viable anymore need thinner and larger
  looks like fucking garbage my dude jesus christ i dont think ive ever seen a model that badly done before what even is it supposed to be ive seen 5 year olds picking up the hobby for the first time make more coherent models their folds are usually more accurate too
  10/10  before seeing your comment i just assumed from the thumbnail that it was a rat folded from printer paper and didnt bother to open the full picture but now im glad i didnt miss seeing that uh thing man those multilayered valley folds on those wings  truly are atrocious
  i have folded this one as well such a simple but fun model love making it
  ive actually made them in all sizes this is my collection for when im bored at work
goldfish design and folded by me
  oh my god you made me spit out my drink please be a real post
    how about you use some good paper instead of folding that poor rat in a shitty paper  thats the kind of pictures that made eric joisel sad seeing his models butchered like that

hi /po/    does anyone have the scans for        there were some from the archive back from 2014 but the link died    also are there any more who did touhou papercraft stuff other than ssa and lily
why is this thread still spooky    i actually like it but why only this one
this board is for permavirgins lmao
  i certainly hope so i really hope we dont have any normalfag filthy unvirgins here
  and yet youre here

dear op i do not have the model you requested but i have one from the same line    may god continue blessing you all and merry christmas      with instructions 3
one more from the line    may the birth of jesus christ enlighten our hearts    
another one    god bless you d

  bet this fag cant even 1cc in on lunatic  seriously tough i need the working links
heres a lot 
does anyone have this model all three links on papercraftsquare are dead and i cant find it anywhere else
    the template
i cant find this model does anyone have it
  found it here dont know the author

is it normal for threads to be up 2 years on /po/ 
  yes try not to disturb them
  thankyou
      update 
wow  a year old thread    right    ive got these two in case you want them    
  here the original source if mega is died has anyone trying do this they looks so cute it sad that i dont have a colorful printer  
  i uploaded those scarlet  the link is fine and it has exactly the same files
  do you have scans for the alice in the op
it wont be long until the official 1yr anniversary of this thread whats my reward
  right here unzips
well the 1 year anniversary of this thread is as uneventful as expected here have a patchy
  looks beautiful
    have fun anon
      hey 2016 and 2017 bros 2018 here thanks
nice to meet you 2019
creme was here
  seconded
any chen ones
  does anyone have template for this patchy the one posted before is for different model and without instructions
  i have this one you can download it here 
  ty such an old template
  this video is dead
    i did it took 5 months on and off    i fucking love it we all should make this shit
  we all should make this shit  nah not really into papercrafting
  as dead as my desire to live
  my wife okuu is so cute
   
  these are great i did them some years ago it was fun  this thread needs some more life btw
  nice haruhi
      fuck yes gonna try these
not the anon im redirecting but just sharing  
      for the sake of posterity ive compiled the cutout wireframes of remilla into a pdf this might be more accessible given theres only that source and a broken mega link
  went ahead and did the same for frandre should be straightforward to print as theyre consolidated into pdfs
  corresponding instructions for remilla in a single pic cause its probably not worth printing out though thats up to you theyre in moonrunes but at least there are photos to give you an idea of what to do
  same for frandre
byakuren  
i am a bit new to these kind of crafts i already have a cutting mat and modelers knife is there stuff i need like glue or paint
  gonna need glue a pva glue stick will do no paint needed
this is pretty cool
its not
its like saying a paper airplane or a fortune teller is cool
what do you think about making sculptures out of aluminum foil
  those are cool though plain aluminum foil isnt the best looking stuf     do you know how they are made  if they are made of only one rectangular sheet of aluminum foil well that mean technically theyre as much origami as any other origami model
  re as much origami as any other origami model    except for the gamipart
  except for the gamipart    well what is paper in origami and what isnt  tissue foil is concidered paper if half metal half vegetal fiber is considered paper why not full metal      you could obtain the same results with tissue foil instead of plain foil would it be origami for you then 
  i think that is not folding xd its just like foil was clay
cat starts whimpering and runs out of room whenever i mess around with aluminum foil  look it up  the sound of the metal scraping is in the ultrasonic range and is apparently so deafening and horrible it can cause seizures in older cats  and thats when i started origami
  some wet folding is like this
  /po/ is for paper and paper accessories only  beat it nerd  before we beat you
  it is possible to make origami out of tinfoil but because its so thin and holds any crease you put in it its rather difficult  that said i did once succeed in folding a semielaborate tinfoil swan
  that is interesting to know ive had my cat for a while now hes probably nearing 5 years old and i just got a kitten last month the two get along but the kitten always wants to play with something and the older cat doesnt feel like dealing with that shit so sometimes when im done playing with the kitten ill make him a little ball out of aluminum foil and let him play with that ive never noticed the older cats reaction but now i think ill stop with that just in case the last thing i need is a cat seizing in the kitchen
  you annoy the fuck out of me i like making things similar to what op does hell this is literally one of the common steps for making clay sculptures and people use aluminum foil and hot glue to make figures but this is absolutely not in any way origami origami is the act of folding a single square of paper into a design without the use of cuts tape/glue and all fold done can be simplified to combinations of 4 folds mountain valley inside  outside reverse folds wet folding is a variant which does not add any physical medium to the finished product and foilpaper still abides by the same rules as traditional origami crumpling a piece of paper isnt origami crumpling and shaping foil isnt origami just because you like origami and you like x doesnt mean x is origami      op youre stuff is fine id suggest finding tutorials on sculpting to add clay/epoxy layers over those to make them permanent and have better detail also since there is no miscellaneous art board here i support this thread being in /po even if its not papercraft or origami read sod off nerd 
  origami is the act of folding a single square of paper into a design without the use of cuts tape/glue    this is /a/ definition of origami the one you like obviously but it doesnt mean this is the one and only way to define origami  until before mid20th century origami in japan widely contained cuts and used rectangles  you are using the purist modern definition of origami    what about billfolding nonsquare rectangles and other shapes folding pentagons triangles   do you know of the traditional origami in europe using rectangles for hats boats planes   what about teabag pack folding  what about modular not a single square of paper either  and crumpling techniques are also accepted as origami even if this is indeed more controversial     also  all fold done can be simplified to combinations of 4 folds  if you want to go this way there is only one fold mountain and valley are the same when you flip the paper and many combinations of it what about sink/unsink spread squash swivel etc    anyway whatever float your paper boat is fine  many definitions of origami there is no truth are ok and the important is that we can fold however and whatever we like
  heh thats funny cause i made this flowchart  but i should change paper in paper or cardboard    but i wasnt trying to annoy you it was just completely hypothetical/philosophical i know including this into origami is a bit artificial and its closer to sclutping than traditional origami
i would say that if youre folding distinctly its origami but if youre just kinda crumpling it like in that image it is more a sculpting/claylike thing than tru origami
  this all the way i hate paper nazis trying to enforce rules on a hobby/art especially when it isnt because they think cuts and glue compromise the beauty and integrity of the design theyre just too lazy to get tools
  its kinda hard to create figures by folding aluminum foil its too thin
  fuck off you purest elitist /po/ is for people who like fun so you should leave
i have done it before it gets pretty hard and might take some practice though but it is still a great hobby
  /po/ is for people who like fun    /po/ is for people who like fun with paper your particular type of fun is not welcome here friend
  he can look into vincent floderer to see crumpled origami so yeah crumpled foil would go in origami thoki yenn had a diagram where you could judge just how far youre willing to go before you stop calling it origami maybe it was in an old bos booklet
  not thoki yenn but john smith i found the page for you 
  origami / kirigami    origami doesnt contain cuts
i often use tin foil for practicing bc i dont have access to a lot of paper that is large/thin enough i think that as long as you couldve made it out of paper youre fine
  /po/ is starting to look like /pol/
this thread spooked me good
  from /pol/ here    do you do hats
  why
    tin foil can be better than paper when trying to make some things like a rose for example
  i dont think it looks good when you scrunch it up if you take the time and make it similar to typical papercraft im sure it would look a lot better
  its not impossible to make origami figurines out of aluminum foil you can do things like you a hot iron to smooth out the surface and avoid crinkles     ive seen some seriously impressive pieces made out of aluminum foil which says a lot because its harder to make good looking origami out of aluminum foil as apposed to paper
  since you posted the pic heres the instructions for anyone that wants it   
  oh nice i wonder if you can create a metropolis figure with tin foil that would be so cool
  thats amazing thanks for sharing
    and the oru part if this qualifies as folding so does crumpling up a piece of paper into a ball
  dont you know about jeremy shafers origami monolithic rubblestone boulder
  kek
the amount of autism on this thread is unprecedented    admittedly i dont spend much time on /po but this shit is shocking
  my idea of fun is painting minifigures can i start making threads here
  as long as your minifigures are made of paper /po/ being about papercraft and origami it should be ok
  thanks now i have to rewatch akira
  akira is pretty shit desu
  tetsuoooooooo
papercraft and origami    wait so all this argument about what is and is not origami only applies to a subset of what this board is about something could not be origami and still be on topic    cool
  welcome to /po/ faggot
  thats where the p in /po/ comes in papercraft and origami  p for papercraft  o for origami  /po/   get it
  lol
  not paper  no folding  sculpting  get out kindly
  sculpting     what how the hell is it sculpting maybe you need to iron out the dents but youre still folding its origami
  do you have a higherres of your pic
  nvm found what i wanted
  its not bloody papercraft
  t brainlet
    you called
   used to do this all the time with my packed lunch foil but since i couldnt pack it well because all it covered was a soggy sandwich my mom made the best i could muster was scorpions and shit where i could just pack it all into one area  i tried with dragons but the wings were too flimsy since they were only one layer anyways  i would sell them for 25 cents until some bitch bought one returned it the next day because her dad called her stupid and demanded 50 cents because of interest rates or some shit
  get out  and go where
  /alu/  aluminum foil
bump
might as well make it paper mache
this thread is from over a year ago
  gonna be 2 years in 2 days
    holy fuck this thread is 2 years old what the fuck /pol/
  /pol/    theres no diagram there
  so /po/ is the real redpill
  /po/ is the true source of 4chans power
  origami war when
i suck the biggest nigger cock
  cool
you guys planning to have the oldest thread in 4chan also greetings from /pol/
  this is so bullshit do you think when moot made this board and called it papercraft and origami he meant papercraft and papercraft no dipshits he meant paper craft and other folded materials
  literally my intentions from day 1    600 days here we come
  thats still papercraft
  hahaha did you actually give her 50 cents
bump
  i saw this at an expo some months ago  they were all made with something like candy wrappers
  funny do you have any close up 
    interesting
sup
whoosp wrong images
ive been trying to make one of those polished aluminium balls that have been going around    will post pic if i perfect it
  please do
  not him but i made this one out of curiosity i acomplished quite a bit of shine with just a hammer but without sandpaper and actuall polishing technique i was left with tiny pits which i could not smooth out because i think i compressed it to a point where it can no longer be compressed and small flakes fall off whenever i try to work on it which may cause more pits i hypothesize that if i had a bigger ball id have more room to smooth out any pits and achieve total smoothness with just a hammer
  how much aluminium foil did you use for this did you keep it in all one piece
  it started with a 6x18 strip because i had to straighten out some headphones it got a little small so a pulled about a 18x18 sqaure of foil and wrapped it around the first ball funny enough i think the final product is about as big as the first ball
  did you rap and hammer a handful of layers at a time i remember seeing a video with this being the cause of that problem
  are you talking about this one   i think his problem was that his ball was dense and as the layers were added it was resistant to the hammer and the foil did not properly stick the pits you see on my ball originate from the wrinkles in the foil when it was pressed by hand hammering the ball closed these gaps either way these pits are very tiny its just that theres a lot of them and there are small smooth spots which is surprising considering it was done with just a hammer i have strong confidence that if i use sand paper and polish i can achieve an extreme shine
  theres no folding involved crumpling aluminum in a certain way to form something is not folding it is sculpting the aluminum in a way is like clay that you sculpt into form
  and demanded 50 cents because of interest rates or some shit  goddamn jews
  would introducing heat to completely fuse it into a round shape be cheating/not allowed
  if its too brittle then try annealing it with a blowtorch look up annealing temperatures for aluminum you dont need to do it for 3 hours like the guides recommend since you only care about the surface you can tell what temperature it is based on the color of its oxide layer below 800f on this chart or glow all metals glow the same color at the same temps im not really sure which charts to trust since their numbers differ by a few hundred degrees annealing doesnt melt metals but it softens brittle metals by reforming the crystal grains and releasing internal stresses
  should also add make sure no part ever hits the melting temp 660c/1220f if melted aluminum hits your poured concrete floor the water in the concrete will expand and make little explosions
that looks awesome really creative great work
  /po/ is for hasbeens
  no u
  no u
  this thread is almost 2 years old  i just want to appreciate that
  ha /trv/ler here i thought we were slow
  i knew someone who does that
  tell me more
is this the slowest board on the site
  are you op  if youre op and youre still replying to posts after 2 years youre an absolute madman
this post was created on my birthday
  yeah  
  yeah its op i still check on this thread at least once every other week this thread finna be the oldest thread on 4chan at some point i know it
  based
  i always liked doing that when i was a child
  orifold  kamipaper    kiricut  kamipaper    orikami origami is folds no cuts or glue traditionally with square paper the symmetry is why it is important    kirikami kirigami is a whole seperate field ascribed to what you have described cutting and glueing and shaping oft not using square sheets    as an expert modular folder i say they are origami every every piece or unit is made from a square dont take my modulars to try to prove a non factual point
  cuts and glue are kirigami different type of craft entirely dont conflate the two
  this by combining the two types of paper craft you diminish the finer points of both stop trying to be inclusive youre diminishing both hobbies
  no cuts  traditionally with square paper  not at all  traditionally it was done essentially for religious purpose and there was often one or many cuts and the paper wasnt usually square either  the whole one square no cut is a relatively recent origami rule
        4 posts in one day  are you trying to kill this thread
this is the oldest thread on the site right now and its kind of off topic since aluminium isnt conventional folding
  shut up fag
hi guys does anyone have these ive looked everywhere but cant find anything thanks
i want so bad these models 
im also interested ill try to find em would be ashame if they can never be recovered
yes please
if anyone finds the taiko no tatsujin one ill be forever thankful
  why would anyone want them
why didnt they even reuploaded it on the original site 
i hope anyone still find them someday
  someone please find the taiko one 
im not sure if this is the right place to ask but i have been wanting to make tissue foil paper to make more complex origami models does hobby lobby have rolls of tissue paper i rarely go there or would i be better off getting it online also does the kind of foil matter what kind of adhesive would work best i was thinking of using spray on adhesive any tips and tricks would be appreciated
i actually have never seen rolls of tissue paper the only way i have seen it come is in large folded rectangles wrapped in plastic    since the goal of tissue foil is to be glued and flattened this makes no difference that it has already been creased i found that the shiny side of aluminium has a hard time sticking with glue to tissue paper
  ah i must have been thinking of a different kind of paper that comes in a roll i was thinking of going to a hobby lobby or some other crafting store if i can find one to get some tissue paper at this point the type of adhesive is what has me stumped i read around that spray on adhesive can possibly add on thickness but im also afraid that liquid glue might soak though the tissue paper if im not careful what would you recommend
  you do want to have the glue soak into the tissue this is what makes it papery it adds stiffness    i would say just buy some tissue paper and foils and test different glues see which one works best and with what paper and foil the materials are cheap enough that you can afford to experiment
  ok i think ill just grab various glue and see what works best your help is much appreciated also a thought just occurred to me i could go to walmart and just get tissue paper there im not sure if it will be big enough but it should be so i dont even have to go to a crafting store and i can get everything in one place
  tissue paper do comes in rolls for example the clairefontaine brand comes in rectangles of 5075 wrapped in plastic but the canson brand comes in rolls    now for the glueing technique i personally prefer spray glue the big pro is that its easy to apply on the foil and that its not wet so the tissue paper will not wrinkle i have a hard time making my paper wrinkleless when using classic glue but im not an expert in tissue foil making also everyone has his technique but i think the easiest and fastest way to acces well done tissue foil is to use spray glue and the possible thickness added is usualy not a problem    if you choose to use liquid glue then you have to be a bit more carefull for the choice of the tissue paper usually cheap tissue paper does not resist being soaked and will be very prone to tear that doesnt mean its not possible with cheap tissue paper but its harder    for the foil you can use any kitchen foil it has to be thin
i use all dollar store materials    tissue paper white ones are 35 for a dollar in dollar tree if you got one in the area   aluminium foil regular not heavy duty  painters tape   glue i use elmers   a wide brush  a long tube i usually save the ones from the aluminium foil     1 tape down your aluminium foil make sure its stretched out completely  2 water down your glue not to much just enough to spread easily   3 tape your tissue paper to the tube and tightly roll it around   4 pour out glue and use brush to evenly coat aluminium foil   5 roll tissue paper onto the aluminium foil slowly and gently and remove from tube carefully  6 pat down any imperfections and wait for it to dry   7 once dry remove tape from corners of aluminium foil flip paper and repeat all steps
  spray on adhesive is probably your best bet as far as adhesive goes but it can be quite expensive diluting white glue like mentioned above would definitely be the more affordable choice if youre going to shell out the dosh for spray adhesive i would recommend making double tissue two sheets of tissue paper  methylcellulose it costs about the same per sheet and results in a much nicer sheet of paper for complex / super complex models
hey guys op here first of all thank all of you for the help as you can see i am working on the paper this is my second attempt the first attempt i didnt use a tube and as you can imagine it didnt work particularly well and i had to scrap it now i got a small pvc pipe and it works well i also managed to get most of the wrinkles out kinda messed up the corner but im sure i can cut it out other than that i think its coming along pretty well for a second attempt i will be working on the white side and then cut it out
alright i just did the white side and cut it out its not perfect but it went better than expected i didnt get the white and red side lined together properly thats why there is a sliver of aluminum on the bottom right corner hopefully that will be hidden away on the model but if not it cant be helped overall im happy with the results
  often the wrinkles are not that much of a problem you can try to smooth them out using your nails practice makes perfectish  i find that using spay glue avoid a lot of wrinkles since the paper remains completely dry but it can be done with white glue    i would advise you to recut the paper to get rid of the uncovered aluminium youll loose less than a centimeters from what is see so its no big deal     you should post a pic of your fold when youre finished overall tissue foil is a good paper thin strong and easy to shape imo the main downsides are that it gets crumpled easily and that reversing folds acurately can be tedious then again practice makes perfectish
  i have been folding for a few hours and the first thing i noticed is how stiff the paper is its still easy to fold but i am not used to foil paper as you pointed out reverse folds take a little more effort than usual to do but not a huge deal but i can only imagine how sink folding will work if you are curious im working on satoshi kamiyas ancient dragon this is a first attempt at it and im not a 100 sure if i can pull it off first try but im pretty confident in my skills so we will have to see how it goes
well seven hours in i was making the claws 5156 and as i expected open sinks are a bitch and a half and i tore the paper suicide has never seemed more viable im going to take another crack at it tomorrow
  keep going once you get used to it the pros far outweigh the cons
  what paper were you using before and did you folded models as complex as the ancient dragon 
  i was using regular kami paper of course i never attempted anything that complex on it due to size restraints that being said im no stranger to complex models i was folding this to test my abilities i was doing alright a few of the folds were not as precise as i would have liked but the big mistake i made was getting impatient on that open sink especially with it being as worn as it was i think im going to start with simpler models that satoshi has and work my way up
postee rolls online start at 399 plus post  you got your standard biodegradable pulp usually a tropical type paper im not certain how long the colours last but the expensive papers tend not to bleed so you can do two colour tissuethe cheaper brands that are called things like assorted gift wrap those runso would test before wetting cause fingers and clothes covered in ink happens  the big name brands dont run ie colour fast caspari simon elvin county stationerypapyrus tissuemost designer paper that comes with clothes
  bumping just for relevance
it shouldnt matter what kind of paper you use for complex models as long as youre using large enough paper the more complex the model the larger your paper should be because there is much more folding to do on complex models than the easy ones of course foil paper does make a lot of the complex models look great
  it shouldnt really matter what paper you craft withthats only if youre trying to make sensewhich your not  basically tissue paper comes as assorted packs in bold or pastel colours  art shops do thembut its more often than not swifter to pop by a gift shopcard shop or upmarket flower shops may have rolls of paper  the best way is to do a google search then you can discuss brandsand read reviews  no doubt you simply like the look of rolls for storage and ease of usedepending on where you reside

fiery dragon by kade chan i folded i was really excited when i was at the last step i never thought id fold a dragon in my life like a moment of ecsatsy  you guys know any more dragons just as challenging or more
try tadashi mori darkness dragon also his phoenix and leviathan are also enjoyable
you might also look up for jo nakashima dragons but they will be probably less compelling
try kade chans fiery dragon 20 sakusaku858s models from monster hunter are pretty fun too
  very cool dragon
which is more complex ancient dragon or western dragon

my childhood    you can check some original i think models on the bottom of the page the ones called cazadores torbellinos planeadores and volteadores are the ones im talking about  most if not all are pretty easy but most of them are pretty unique
i have been into origami for a while now and i feel like i cant find any challenging origami anyone have any really challenging origami instructions found some cool pictures but i cant find the instructions
  what do you mean you cant find any challenging origami  show us what youve folded and tell us more about the kind of challenge youre looking for
i mainly want the instructions for the snail above
  instructions in hebrew
  either  find some crease patterns origami tanteidan books are good for them and decipher them  or  follow diagrams from shuki kato kamiya and robert lang if you are too much of a retard to decipher cps
you probably already have this but take it anyway
and heres a really challenging model a pegasus try making this
thanks for the snail also i might do the pegasus
helppppp 
  not every one can fold from a cp alone dumbass
  dont be mean please
  the diagrams arent that hard to follow my dude
  you should be able to learn it tho
  pretty cool snail
saving the last thread in the catalog  bump for

just uploading some bits to make a functional set
its not clear from the picture cut the white mounting bit so you get what you want the balconys shape to be leave asis to have the balcony be two outside corners cut to the red line to have it be a flat end im using the flat ends as landings for staircases to go up to or cut to the blue line to have it be an inside corner unlike most of the system which is very modular the balconies you have to plan out ahead of time

i want you guys to print out part of this thread and turn it into origami    you might be wondering why you would make this boring thread into origami  well thats because this isnt just some random thread  this is going to be the oldest thread on all of 4chan    have fun
first for lazy bones like me i used this
  save a treewait
  wtf  yesterday i posted the navy seal copypasta in this thread so someone would print it and fold it i was banned for 24h for global rule 3 infringment and my post was deleted     i just wanted to use some text that was iconic of 4chans culture fuck the stupid janitor/mod who did that
i would happily do that but i dont have a printer
  so basically fuck niggers and jews asians and americans unite to stop these threats also origami is lit af

  was literally just typing that to post for you haha
  ahah cheers
somebody has origami works of quentin trollip
  not with me
  search before you ask
ive searched for it and i can not find it thats why i ask it
  ive searched for it and i can not find it  where did you search 
  found it within 10 seconds of googling origami works of quentin trollip pdf op        find it in the thread
  obv the only place the man who folded knows to look 4chanorg/po/catalog
  man who folded  ive seen this many times who is it a tripfag or something
  nah he used different names every so often but you can tell him by his constant repetitive demands and broken grammar always stating someone has whatever hes looking for he used to use all caps for a while just pretty annoying and always clearly the same fag
hi /po/  i know that everyone of you made this and maybe there was a lot of threads about it but it is my first papercraft and i want to ask if you can give me some advice about it like what to do to make it easy or where to be careful  i made 1 gear and it was hard to glue the teeth but it looks good  thenk you
definitely not recommended for a first papercraft try something easier first
  mmm well i started  i made a mistake with paper for the little one but the big is good  i cant stop now any advice
i made this almost a year ago hmm it super hard but easy enough if u have enough patient gears need precise try to dont make it loose out too much or rear too much pay attention at gear 7 dont use glue if it have to some part dont have glue and find all things you need to this first 6mm straw to make a cylinder for rotate exaclty 6mm like coctail straw with long curve strip i use that and a rod and tube matched to make the rotary axis   diameter can be diffirent a bit depend on what u can find just adjust the hole in gear 7 to fit the rod and tube u have and good luck any question  just ask on this thread
for glue use pva glue for a good timing u need a little time to adjust the teeth to make it perfect dont use any kind of quick dry glue unless u are skilled or u will lose the whole gear follow the instruction glue couple teeth at a time hold steady and wait to dry then continue
pva glue  oh lucky me i use that because it is the one that i have at home  i will use the mcdonalds straws it seems that they are the exact size  i had problems with the teeth in the gear 2 and i dont know if i should make it again or try it like that the hole in the middle is a bit deformed  thank you very much i will ask more things
make it again and nice if u can but u can still try the old one at last u will be attach gears to inner sphere  no glue only paper joint so if it cant work just make a new one d
i am having problems with the glue and the gear is getting dirty is there any way to hide it when it is over
i think we can peel it off when it dry but you always can paint it white red whatever or make a duplicate of the face with thin paper  should be then paste it on the gear
aileens tacky glue if its available might be useful for a project like this it stays tacky for awhile allowing for precise adhesion and has a strong bond when it dries and remaind pliable no cracking or stiffening   one solution to getting dry glue off the surface a nail file or lightly running it with fine sand paper
  i tried to peel it but i fear to break it it is good paper and i know that it will not happen but you know  i like the idea of the duplicate face    i will search for that dont you know the non comercial name i dont know how to search for it in my country    thank you both
hehe i have an idea try duplicate face with a kind of image on it you can try photoshop or kind of to insert some picture to the gear face then cut out and paste on that would be awesome i think d
mine gears long time ago d
and completed model   iframe width560 height315 src frameborder0 allowautoplay encryptedmedia allowfullscreen/iframe
  wow nice  i should make at least 3 more if it goes well so i will try a couple of options to cover the gears
  wow the pattern on the surface looks good really adds to the mechanical aspect of the project
  damn 3 more of this painful papercraft hhahaha that will be a big deal d
  i showed the original to a lot of people now mom girlfriend friend female and friends girlfriend want one and i am an idiot that women like use
  poor you mate d good luck with it they will be very happy though 
cant believe we got this far love you c
    video video
i made the cube one a while back warningpainting looks nice but takes forever
  op here  i am still working with this but i stoped for a while buscase too much work and study these days of course no video yet  i hope finish it this year
  oh video i want to see how it works
im looking for the instructions of any unicorn origami but i could not find any or at least a complete document any clue
ive fond this but y dont like it because is not origami  
  look at this list here    when you find one you want fold google the book title to look for the book keep in mind many books arent available online or are hard to find
thanks  this is te instructions i wold like to find      i gess they are like you said in a book and they are hard to find
  the creator has not written a book as far as i know so the instructions only exist in his video on youtube but his video shows the diagram on the corner of the screen   
someone have new books of origami
  someone have new books  no one has this book too new you are too soon to ask at least wait till next year or even longer
  will post once i get em
  could this be the idiot who folded once again under a new alias  you are asking the same dumbass questions as that other guy asking for stuff that no one has yet or asking for stuff that hasnt come out yet no no one has it yet
troll alert
olympiad 2018 thank
  its not out yet damn
ok
does anyone have origami new worlds by alessandro beber it came out a year ago
  its in the lower middle area of the last archived thread  go get it
  thank you also here it is again for anyone whod want it
anyone has tanteidan magazine 171 please share
  if you would learn how to read more than one thread you would realize that its in this thread 
kinda obscure but i suppose its worth a shot does anyone have aussiegami i read it in my school library as a child before i was good enough to fold any of the models inside and within months it had disappeared from the library altogether would be awesome to revisit it the paperfolding down under version was the one i had not the prehistoric one
ive looked everywhere and cant find anything the artist is called ingrid siliakus she does some cool stuff but wondering if she had any templates or does she keep this stuff secret
  its supposedly all from one sheet of paper too thats why im interested
the general style is called architectural kirigami and nope you wont find templates by ingrid siliakus online anywhere but there are a couple books with simpler patterns
  are you serious how comes and why not surely people can work it out right    if not do you know where i can find the simpler ones
  not one person is interested in this sort of stuff
  well ingrid siliakus earns her dosh from exhibitions and from selling replica of her works on top of that her stuff is so detailed and complex that she uses a laser cutter to save weeks or even months of manually cutting and scoring the models ive never seen templates of her stuff online and she doesnt have any on her website  and i think the complexity of her projects is beyond what average persons would want to try to copy anyways    but architectural kirigami is pretty simple and straightforward once you understand the basic techniques which are the same as for regular popup cards/books you can look at any other model like those from siliakus and easily copy them yourself    look for kirigami and architectural kirigami patterns on sites like pinterest or just google the terms and youll find plenty templates and check the book sharing thread here on /po/ thats where i got a few books from last year
this is probably too big to post
     thank you so much been a real help
  ill try to post some of the stuff ive got on my hdd but its not much most books are too big to post on 4chan im surprised the 5mb file even worked whats the limit for pdf here but i got all of them from an google archive somebody posted in the sharing thread and from public torrent sites like kickass by searching for origami and kirigami anyways so they should be easy to find
this template makes a nice pen holder cant find the version without watermarks though
this is a model i always wanted to copy
  basically im looking for something similar to ingrid siliakus city i just need a template so i can work out the rest
  what the fuck just from cutting one sheet of paper
    it looks pretty basic actually
    yeah its pretty simple youve seen nothing yet do you know peter callesen
  this book here has a few templates which have a somewhat similar style nested buildings bridges
  well thats what i have some other books are too big to post here
    
  clean version i was too lazy to distinguish between mountain and valley folds because its obvious which is which the book suggests to score mountain and valley on different sides of the paper for best results though
i knew i had a better version of the pencil holder and a few more incoming
  this variation is nicer
  
ive seen origami before but this stuff is blowing my fucking mind the detail and brains to make that using one piece of paper
  maybe its because it isnt origami but kirigami
so is this thread going to die like the other kirigami threads
  probably everyone just making weeb stuff with paper than any of this magic i find this more beautiful desu and a lot more complex im trying to designa tetris kirigami right now a lot harder than it looks
        god tier not exactly what op was asking for but pretty close    one thing to note about ingrids work is she turns the main fold on its side like a greeting card or birthday card this gives the buildings a better look and doesnt leave a gap in teh sides this is the biggest thing i have observed so far will come back with more if i work out the intricacies
  yeah youre right ingrids works tend to have a vertical main fold like books rather than the original cards    i posted masahiro chatanis book because he was the guy who actually invented architectural kirigami / origamic architecture see  so naturally ingrids stuff is based on the technique and inspired by his works the links at the bottom of the wikipedia article are worth checking out for some other interesting related stuff
cut the other day found the design somewhere online and copied it
  without backlight looks a bit more boring
    looks cool anon      first attempt
      i tried one from this book the escher stairs kinda funny because escher lived in my village
        this is great stuff
thanks for all the templates i have a laser cutter 
this is great stuff thank you all for your posts i had two books that show how to create simple popups such as letters and simple structure templates i can no longer find them but wanted to introduce my kids to the craft this will get us started i just wanted to say thank you
    nicely done heres another cool escher template
  picture of the finished model dont have an own version right now      i envy you wish i could afford one i got a silhouette portrait vinyl cutter the other day but had to realize that it doesnt work too well with thick cardstock so now im saving up for a laser cutter as next step      glad you find the stuff useful and have fun with it
wow the designs in this thread are incredible first time ive ever heard of 切り紙
i made some stuff like this a while ago even designed a pattern once lost it tho
does anyone have any christmas kirigami they would like to post tis the season and i would be much obliged
  i was referring to christmas related templates
    seconding this ive seen lots of nice stuff on pinterest but most of the time those fags only post finished pictures not the templates
    are you all banned from google  here     for an extra bonus click on the tab where it says images or whatever its called in your local google language
    of course we searched google but most are just pics of completed projects not detailed templates like the post before you explained i guess we were hoping for some help from genuine and generous anons who love to share in the craft
  yea but theres no proper templates its like this shit is hidden from public is it forbiddin art or something
  yeah i think its because kirigami is even less mainstream than origami theoretically there are plenty books with templates for popup cards somewhere out there but its really hard to find scans online  its even hard to find them in local libraries or book stores because its not a very popular hobby at least where i come from
      check this one im currently making a template     
  thats a lovely model although personally it would be nice if it had some colors to it
  well those architectural kirigami models usually get a lot of their appeal from backlight and shawows adding multiple colors could distract from that however im currently experimenting with similar models consisting of multiple colored layers and they have an appeal of their own gonna post pics once i have something worthy to be looked at hehe
หกดหกด
  does anyone have vol1 of that series ive been looking for a while and cant find it
any good free programs to design this stuff  free programs allowed too
  im only aware of two programs and sadly none of them is free they both have free trial versions though    popup card designer / popup card designer pro         popup card studio       the free demo versions have restrictions of course popup card designer has saving disabled cant remember studio maybe i never even tried it and since the topic is a bit obscure i wasnt able to find cracks or keys online and the full versions are a bit too expensive if you ask me if you manage to find something id really appreciate when you leave a heads up in this thread op here
  however its not really hard to design your own patterns on plain graphing paper or using snap to grid in a free vector program like inktrace once you understood the basic workflow  which you can easily learn by playing around with the free versions of those programs which is what i do
    thanks man appreciated   tfw your program is so unpopular no one will even pirate it
      if youre still around i found the program here works fine its a spanish site but its the english version     
  awesome thanks a lot
  nice
bump
great thanks a lot
hey im looking at a lot of this and wondering if im making the right assumption is the math of this that every line in the xy planefrom one end of the paper to the other has to be of equal length it seems like it would be relatively simple to make a 3d modeling software to help you make them and to tell you if a design followed that simple rule

  actually the limit is 8 mb
here are a few more kirigami books you can try  here is the first one
  here is the second one
  here is the third one
  here is the last one that i have
  here is a better version of the first one  plus i have the other two
  heres vol 2
  heres vol 3
  can someone explain me why there is two different parts of the saint basils cathedral
  actually meaning there is one full size and one which is only a part of it with blue lines
    then why not try the other book that says its of better quality than this one in this one  everything is right learn to read and check things out before you start bitching about something
    that one is just a bad copy get the other one
  wtf are you on im just asking a question thanks anyway    thanks man
  wtf are you on im just asking a question  you know people say that there are no stupid questions but that was a stupid question anyone could see that the first book was a very bad copy fyi im not on anything thats why i told everyone to use the second copy instead of the first one im the one who put the better copy in here after realizing that i loaded the bad copy by mistake
  i thought initially that you were supposed to print it on a doublesided piece of paper but couldnt wrap my head around it and i was still reading it without going through all the thread  you sound very butthurt for some reason chill out
how is it for a first i kinda fucked up and there is two part teared up during the folding that i got half right but i think that look fine still
  you sound very butthurt for some reason chill out    you sound like an idiot
  as someone who only does origami and not kirigami this is amazing
  okay man you win the argument    thanks
  a doublesided piece of paper  as opposed to a singlesided piece of paper you halfwit
wow this board must be slow over a year old
    11/16/15  f
    these two in particular are great    i want to try almost everything in these books
  i attempted the kirigami on the cover holy shit is this difficult to make cleanly pictured is the prototype made from regular printer paper ill finish the version with proper cardstock tomorrow
  also thought i may as well include the template i drew in cad
  final in cardstock
  is a simple design possible to do with just a scissors i dont have any lasers
  an exacto knife does a pretty good job
    anyone know what kinda laser cutter she uses    i would love a way to print out multiples of these to give out instead of cutting them all by hand     even just simple ones it would save me an effort
  can i still reply
  sure you can
  what about me
  obviously
  i also wanted to make this particular city i guess she has too much creativity
  not boring at all the shadows are much more subtle in that one me likey
  please respond
yeah ive been trying to fold this one for a solid few hours and i always get stuck around part 20 because the side represented by the white covers everything at the bottom represented by the red and thats the point where everything goes wrong and i cant really do anything
on 17 be sure to tuck it under so it looks like on 18    to make 21 you make 20 go back to 18 and turn it over  fold the edges up make 19 and 20 while maintaining the 21 shape    2122 are the true bitch you need to reverse that whole fold you will need to open the model when doing this its easy to end up on a 20 looking shape so you need to make sure while reversing it you are going to make the final shape look like 22    for 24 take the edge closest to you and fold it like on pic then the edge after it will deform and you fold that one into a pyramid
why are origami instructions always so shit why do they never bother to properly illustrate and show difficult steps from different angles
  because diagramming is fucking annoying and difficult and most designers dont like to do it hence the cps  also more difficult models might have more difficult to understand diagrams because folders are supposed to be better at folding and understanding instructions
    maekawas diagrams are well known for being very clear and unambiguous
  sure they are but as  wrote they are clear for people who know how to fold a bit
  now i wanna see those other models it says arent in the book
  must bump
  well shit i got stuck too but on step 11  inside reverse folds always get me
  can someone please explain how to proceed with step 11 what does he mean by inside reverse fold at 45
  hey me too
  well keep this for a little while maybe someone will learn something
i can do it but im having trouble uploading will poast step on youtube later if it helps
  
  just realized i didnt use two sided paper because i dont have any sarry
i love how your so overly keen to help on some questions but dumbfounded about shit you definitely my should knowpedo alert
  t elon musk
origami pokemon thread  post cps diagrams and your finished models
  are those 90 and 45 creases based on the division in thirds and sixths of the quarters
  the cp uses a 12ths grid
  okay then i might give it a try  wheres  though
oh nice i got trips    use the original fold as a shaping reference
  did somebody said cp
568055  first time on /po/ or are you just 13
    first time on /po/  uses  sign instead of     is this your first time on 4chan
  havent you seen people use  when they dont want to give people yous
  nope and ive been on this site about a decade maybe i just never noticed
  oh hi nepafarius  heres your manta ray that i made from white tissue foil
  nicely done one thing i noticed is people tend to miss the reverse folds near the back so you can see the fins adjacent to the tail    must not be so clear in the photos sometimes its hard to remember for other people its the first time theyre seeing the steps
  aight heres a couple of my designs no cps sorry  my girafarig design i didnt plan on doing this version i aimed for the beta but this came out of several failed tries im still working on the beta version
  my favourite design  stunfisk
  here are some notes that help me with collapsing this base
    and my attempt at relicanth
  fuck ive just realised i said top right corner i meant top left  updated in case anyone wants to save it
  nice job finding the reference point
  nice id love to fold this whats the base
  wait i think i figured it out
  3/4 of a frog base   the sink at the centre of the cp is just below the tip of the flap for the mouth and the smaller one inside doesnt really matter its just to make things a bit easier to move   the mouth squash is about 1/3 of its flap
  wait no its not a frog base i cant remember what its called but you should be able to work it out from the picture
  damn thats nice
i dont suppose anyone knows what the reference point for kakami hitoshis rattata is ive tried all the obvious stuff quarters thirds fifths sixths but i just cant crack it    source if anyone wants to see the final model  
  that kinda looks like sevenths i wouldnt be surprised a few of his models use 7ths
  henry pham has over 50 pokemon and please subscribe
  its a simple rabbit ear on the side of diagonalthen the next reference is where the lines meet the edgenow you have the top upper most squaredo the stuff in there no need for box gridthe less lines the better
  then you have a big rectangle in the center obviously those are halfway creases on either side of the 90 line
  kite and fish bases were the first things i tried as the site mentions 225 but they dont help with any reference points if i just fold the square on the inside of the blue lines here i can crease everything its just grafting on the excess i cant work out
  you numpty the golden rule of origami is every line relates to where it meets an old crease or parallel to or half way between or a section of a planeso as a newbie look at the half then the third then the square ofwhere the bisector or plane sometimes 80 hidden is line with the start
  i know the logic of crease patterns i have solved several with no help and no problems through various means of trial and error   look at the image i posted  the rabbit ear you suggested doesnt provide any other references that would naturally lead to the next one nor do they intersect with thirds quarters fifths sixth sevenths or eights so at what point does your suggestion provide a solid reference point for the blue lines in      if youre still so cocksure im not getting what youre saying show me on the crease pattern
  impressive

dear /po/  i am in the market for a paper cutting machine i have been looking around today and the sizzix eclips2 caught my eye pic related    is this machine recommended if not which one is your preferred machine i want to make lots of tiny cardboard boxes so cutting performance with thicker stocks is important to me as well as speed and reliability of cut as well as hardware which machine do you use and why what would you recommend for me    kind regards  anon
  i have a silhouette cameo 3 its pretty decent havent had any real problems with it some times it takes a few minutes to start cutting i think its a software issue or something but it still gets the job done  im find a lot of different prices for both machines shop around for whichever is cheaper
how is it possible to make circular fold
sage    make a circular fold
  be good
  the fold would have to be concave or convex
  precrease with the bone stick
  they just show the circle/river packing and arent folded
  assuming pic related
yell it scream it shout it hippies
  so it it just a reference in pic related of course    good thing im still not good enough to have to buy one of these
i said if i came up with anything new id share it with you all     im still focusing on drawing but at the moment i am waiting on books and these are related to what i want to draw in the future anyway    ive been focusing on minimalism and have been trying to come up with a couple     i decided not to post on the old thread i dont really like having to slog through petty arguments and people being rude to one another just to find the one or two people who are actually saying anything civil and productive     i dont know if ill share diagrams for any of the models i make next any fun i had sharing has been spoiled by greedy spoild people i always ask for people to post their finished products but so far have only ever seen one doesnt feel like im getting anything back especially for a community that seems so eagar to have every diagram possible     anyway this will probably serve as an update thread for people who dont follow my flickr     heres a minimalist gray fox
a a one fold sting ray
  lmao
  you did much better work in your last thread if this is what youre working on now then we dont really want any diagrams at least your last stingray actually looked like a stingray
  then we dont really want any diagrams  we  you dont speak for us  maybe you are not interested in simple models but other people are
  not many not for that kind of shit stuff that doesnt resemble anything at all
    heres a minimalist gray fox    if you say so 
  see i wanted to say that but it comes off rudely from the creator     there are many different types of origami and although many people on this board dont think so they are all equally important and beautiful        im sorry you dont think my designs resemble what i wanted them to but i vetted them against my family who do not fold origami and they recognized them immediately     that was kind of the point really as i wanted to learn to draw better to make a comic centered around origami that anyone can pick up and appreciate
  a comic  looks interesting and unusual to me can you give more details  ot i like that fox
  thats cool
  theres no accounting for taste
  i was one of the people in your other thread that was kind of looking forward to seeing some diagrams for the leafy sea dragon until you quit on it youll probably quit on this too eventually
  like i said im still learning to draw check my flickr to see how shit i am at it     basically a slice of life school comedy these designs were for separate characters
great work   few obviously fail to appreciate the beauty and art to minimal it works with drawing writing so why not origami   keep at it
simple baby turtle not as light as the other two
  now i have to agree with you that is a cute baby turtle that one i would like to see diagrammed  nice work this time
  minimalism can be good as long as its not an excuse for laziness or mental masturbation    fox is okay but a little flat to me i would choose a darker grey for the paper as it is the color change is not very noticeable    turttle is cute i like the paper     i think the ray is good but youre not the first one to have the very same idea i cant remember where it was but ive already seen a bunch of minimalistic 1/2/3 folds ray in a book
that fox is actually pretty good op i like it  has a brutalist feel to it  id like to see a diagram if you dont mind    would you mind sharing more of your works as well
  sting ray more like stink ray
  why the hell does everyone keep saying that the fox sucks and there is no way that i would proudly display anything that looked like that id have to tear it to shreds on the other hand the baby turtle looks great and that is the one i would like to see some diagrams of sorry man just my opinion
i cant believe im in an origami board and motherfuckers cant appreciate minimalism why arent you complaining about every single crane diagram in existance go make taxidermy instead      doesnt resemble anything at all  theres something wrong with you      why the hell does everyone manage to see beauty where i cannot   translated your lines for you  youre stuck in the mindset of the figurative every image is made out of shapes and each of those has an effect on the total picture once you realize and feel that shapes in themselves have communicative value to them you will also realize that sometimes one doesnt need much complication to send messages   i swear to god everyone who complains about more abstract and minimalist works has never really tried to not hate it i was once one of the retards who keep talking about classical art revival until i went to arts class and realized i was just one big dumb pleb
    hey im really digging this    ive been thinking about abstract origami creatures vs clearly defined shapes lately    i really like the abstract fox    i folded a horse figure a few months ago that didnt really look like a horse but had this abstract feel about it    ive been thinking a lot about the origami i see on youtube and how the figures are so crisp and delineated    everything is so symmetrical as well    ive just recently wanted to get into more abstract figures and some asymmetrical shapes    keep it up
  it would be cool to have some videos or a diagram
  ok mother fucker you have your jackedoff opinions and i have mine i think it looks like crap and you dont good for you but dont go trying to make everyone that doesnt like it see it your way because you had an art class or two and as far as resembling anything it really doesnt look like a fox at all so there must be something wrong with you if thats what you see i can dig minimalism but even minimalism has to look like something like the turtle
    blah blah blah again with the piece of shit fox you people are fucking idiots
  this thing could be a number of different animals but you chose to call it a fox good for you
  not to sound like an art snob but i just started reading drawing on the right side of the brain and there was a chapter about the development of childhood art at some point children consider hyper realism to be paramount and anything less to be worthless thats why i think people make fun of art that seems like there wasnt much skill or thought behind it       i have a few diagrams on my google drive that might interest you setting sail particularly and if you want minimal designs check out vivienne bertyspelling on flickr shes quite good      i mentioned in a previous comment that im brainstorming for a comic series i want to draw eventually and i dont think these designs are particularly lazy i spent quite a bit of time trying to get the curves just right and the particular pose for the best view
i thought of a model that would fit well into my story if i ever git gud at pen to paper art because of your comments thanks for your support even if its not for everything i make
  links to google drive
  
no new models atm but here are some drawings of my models i did slowly improving in still life going though drawing on the right side of the brain     going through perspective made easy after that then need to find a book on construction
  outstanding art work dude
   i still have a long way to go until i can make my comic shading perspective human anatomy have improved a tiny bit but i havent really dived into those subjects yet just scraped the surface     my life drawing have improved exponentially thanks to this book though which will really help when using references like origami models for instance
made a tiny shark while exercising 2125in piece of tissue foil 125 completed
  looks nice is it one of your creations 
  yes i posted the revised model in my previous post and posted photodiagrams a few years ago
  do you still have a copy of the photodiagrams
  i do not this was when i originally made it several years back
reading the comments against your minimalism op are disparaging i too specialize in minimalist origami and would love to discuss it more and see more of your work as someone who feels that origami  naturally lending itself to a series of simple shapes color fields and acting as a representative art rather than a realistic art  is more than suitable to minimalism
  its a shame maybe i would have folded this one 
  i dont really specialize in any origami and i was attempting to make minimalist design for my characters for a particular chapter in the story im coming up with i dont let to comments get to me they actually almost write dialogue for me     id love to chat about origami but you may find me dreadfully boring
  as enticing as the potentiality of other folding my designs is i am spending most of my time exercising my drawing
  well i said maybe because its hard to see the model on the photo maybe i wouldnt like the model if the photo was good or maybe id like it more    anyway i find that youve progressed a lot since the time of the shitty dragon and im always happy to see your creations if you ever retrieve the photo diagram or a clearer photo of your shark let me know also is the shark body 3d or flat 
  sorry if i came off rudely im used to having everyone on here ask for diagrams and offering nothing in return my last thread was the first time anyone posted their fold of my model and i have posted about 20 designs in the past few years feels like hollow efforts     its nice to have a fan out there i dont think ive improved all that much i just upgraded my paper which makes a lot of my models look better than they are     i have a clearer photo of the shark its a 3d model made from a bird fruit base hybrid i guess i got a lot of flack in the past about using sinks but most of them are necessary if not just fun in my opinion
  its pretty badass share the diagrams
  thats because youve always provided them in the past now all of a sudden youve stopped making them for your new designs like the baby turtle the leafy sea dragon which you just quit on and now the shark
  you shouldnt be too much concerned about coming off rude on 4chan     i folded your shrimp a long time ago and also the quaver not very neatly though     i guess the different layers under the dorsal fin are supposed to mimic the shark gills  if yes theyre not at the right place but its a nice touch
  theyre supposed to be just in front of the pectoral fins so i think theyre close enough to the right place since its hard to fold paper to the exact specs very good job on the shark
  i explained that i am focusing on drawing my few free hours are spent practicing and writing up storylines my newest designs are for the story
  bird fruit base hybrid  i know about the bird base but what is it you call fruit base
  fruit base is a frog base without and petal folds just squash the sides of the preliminary base and youre done
  wtf is this shit  abstract is one thing  drawing a circle and calling it a square is another  cut your bullshit
    yeah theyre meant to be gills i know theyre in the wrong place but i didnt want to leave paper unused
  also im really diggin that paper definitely a good choice for that model
  hey op im not the guy that asked about those being gills on your shark im the one who defended the shark with the diagram of the shark showing where the gills are supposed to be i already knew they were supposed to represent gills and thought you did a bangup job on the whole thing like i said it looks badass great job man
  thanks  i know that base but it was the first time i heard this name
heres a still life of my origami dolphin     im practicing my hand at formal and informal perspective right now trying to find a comfortable middle ground all that is on my flickr
  what a shitty dragon
  i like your fox could you take a picture of it standing
nepafarius u should just go on the origami subreddit its a cool community
now this place sucks even more than it did before  now more than ever would be a good time to shut /po/ down indefinitely
what the hell is with this new team crap
  april fools thing
   now would be a good time tu shut your mouth
  now would also be a good time for you to fuck off
  i really dont like the layout of reddit might also be because im not used to it
mouse design
  i love it i like the eyes and especially the ears
  thank you so much i honestly wasnt happy with how it turned out originally
made a diagram for the mouse an actual diagram not just photos link here    
  cool thanks maybe you could make actual diagrams of some of your other models as well    crab  dolphin  firefly  frog  leafy sea dragon  manta ray  octopus
  was actually thinking about that bundle them into a book
  that would be pretty awesome
owl
  pretty cool model are you going to diagram it
new design coming in a day or so just gotta make a stand for it
new model first the stand
and the model a roman centurion helmet
another picture to see the back a bit
for all you booty lovers
angel not even what i wanted to make but it turned out nicely
  the head is concaved so even at different perspectives it looks like the head is facing you
  very nice angel really like the interplay of light and shadow
  id say thank you but i feel that has more to do with only having limited light sources wasnt particularly intentional     also heres another new model of a flea not the most photogenic model tried for ages to get a good shot but the depth and shaping got lost on camera
  i like it it look like one of robert langs older models
  haha thanks ill probably be old and gray before i can make models that look like langs current designs
hey op you wanted to make a comic right why not instead of drawing it you make it out of collage if you get an okay lighting setup it could be very good
  well lang is pretty old and gray currently
      are you still thinking about that book  would love to see it eventually
  the comic isnt diagrams of my models its a slice of life type manga with unique characters and story that tevolves around problem children in an origami club      yes ive been working on some diagrams but im not happy with how some of them turned out    here a random assortment study i did a few nights ago there is also some foot studies on my flickr if youre into that
  what is your flickr anyways
      gonna add another drawing thats probably not kosher on this board so you can check it there
  how about it nepa are we gaining any ground with your diagrams or book yet
  my computer is broken and i dont have any money for a new one books gonna be on hiayus indefinitely unfortunately
  damn and i really wanted to get these 7 sets of diagrams  oh well
  thats definitely not good to hear
the fox looks a whole lot like lonely sheep dog diagram from one of those pageaday calendars  
  it is similar and very cute i hadnt heard of this publication until recently     i submitted my mouse diagram to ousa and received an email that margaret van sicklen was interested in my work for her calendar     she wanted my work to be in the 2019 edition though not the mouse i had submitted 
for some reason i was under the impression that nepafarius was from poland i have no idea why i thought that
  thats really funny i often do the same on here and assume people are from the us
  just here to post in a based hat thread
  yeah why was there a hat i always thought that was for 4chans bday is it also for old posts or something
  its just for the birthday but old posts that were around during a birthday sometimes break and show a hat for no reason possibly if the hat is cached somewhere in your browser
i made this origami tree frog by robert lang origami design secrets i am satisfied with how it turned out but since it is for a gift i would like it to look as good as possible what recommendations do you have
detail on the front
back leg i used 4545 cm tissue foil from origami shop they call it sandwich paper the forelegs are very thick and the eyes although recognisable are not as shapely as id like
while your folding is technically up to par your finished product seems lifeless    this is not really a specific instruction but you should try and change your mindset since your skills will only get you so far     each model a master designs is unique even if they folded it from the same diagram a thousand times the model looks alive because the artist treated it as a individual piece and not a factory model
  if you put it in a box make sure you poke holes in the box so it can breathe
  you can pose it more lifelike the general idea is good but if the frogs climbing the same side limbs shouldnt both be extended try tuck the left leg up more and extend the left arm further extend the right leg further and tuck the right arm in more all the legs are also all in the same horizontal plane  try add some vertical difference in the limbs like its climbing over something
i agree with  and   you should try to look at pictures of real frogs in their natural living environment to get an image of their body movements / limb position /   origami speaking look at pictures of akira yoshizawa models but those folded by himself his models are usually very simple however the shaping is the most important part to bring life to the final piece of art
i modelled mine after langs own fold does that one look fine to you
modular origami
  what module is used here
golden venture folding or modular origami as you inappropriately call it is the most pleb activity involving paper that there is while it theoretically belongs on /po/ i say the only place fit for it is a crematorium i despise this pathetic bastardised thing and i strongly suggest you delete this thread  oh wait its too old now anyway i hate golden venture  ugly cheap kitschy laborious way of wasting paper it gives origami a bad name just ask a random person what origami is and watch them tell you about da swans from many piece of paypa i dont know how to wrap this up so just refer to 
and just so you know this is what modular origami really is
  nevermind on closer inspection those are just standard triangle units im dumb
  origami is folded paper modular or not dumb ass
  what  when did i claim otherwise
    is this board so fucking slow you can predict the next post youre going to make  smdh
  i say the only place fit for it is a crematorium  fuckin lold   i guess its because 3d models are rendered using polygons and whatnot but this shit always makes me think of /v/
  tomoko fuse is my favorite
  its pretty looks pretty firm as well due to the compact use of paper i wonder what it would feel like and how its weight is    additive origami would be a nice name for it as well
does anyone have a diagram or instructions for this is there a website to modular origami like this i only found instructions for smaller things like a swan or a bear
fortunately no golden venture origami is trash
  anon seriously this would take you an absurd like really absurd amount of time to do it try to make the swan see how much time it takes and how boring it is then take a look at this dragon and realize it has more units than 30 swans the outcome is simply not worth the time     also what would you do with it when finished  this model is pretty fucking big and cant be moved around easily do you really intend to have a table in your appartment only used to hold that shit       anyway even if you had the instruction you would never complete it just do a paper mache reproduction it will be easier faster smaller and will look better
  i work night shifts in security and already made like 1000 pieces while listening to audio books i know its a lot of boring and repetitive shit
  its pretty much legos or clay but with triangular paper pieces instead  no diagrams just your imagination i wouldnt call it origami tho modular or not
ahhhh that looks nice
here is a collection of files ive gathered scale is 1270 ideal for xwingtmg   plus they look really cool
  so that file is colour teams of xwings and here are instructions
a wings
  and the awing swarm
here is one of each the tie the interceptor and the advance with instructions with swarms to follow for each
  tie swarm
    alt tie colours  first order
  interceptors
  royal colours interceptors
    and some other cool interceptor skins
  tie advanced several of
slave one its not too hard but instuctions are listed on the site in the pdf
  and a kath scarlet reskin
y wings from the rebels   the engines are fiddly but looks great
  and a swarm
the falcon you will need both parts and the instructions to build takes about 3 hours
  part 1
    part 2
  alt skin part 1
    alt skin part 2
  oops
tie bomber
tie phantom two normal 2 cloaking and 2 cloaked  the build is pretty similar to the other ties
  crap clearly i am tired  ok 6 regular is less than a meg but the reskins total over 8 so unless you really want it i wont bother
bwings because they rock
jedi fighters tiny
  b wing skins
if this gets some attention i have lots more
thx for sharing keep the good jobs
  pretty nifty
bump
  bump must save from /v/ invasion
this is auesome thank you for the uploads
nice
this is awsome if theres more to be please post
all these are on a dropbox ill see if i can find the link
  these are all the 1270 scale paper craft star wars models they are made by a guy in france a lot of them are based on other peoples work that he scaled and cleaned up    if you want other bits for the game you can get them at     ive built tie fighter tie interceptor xwing and currently working on the falcon
  you should crosspost these into the xwing/star wars generals in /tg/ op theyd find it neato
hey i have the files for pic related i printed them out on regular printer paper 85inx11in but it didnt fit the figure since it was too small of course how can i resize the file so it can fit a 6 inch figure like pic related
  take a picture of this picture with your iphone 3 transfer to google drive download open in mspaint print from there
  get a wide format printer theyre pretty cheap these days epson makes some pretty good ones i have a wf 7610 and can print max 13 x 19 and scans 11x17 great for papercraft and comics  ive taken some a4 paper crafts and blown them up to 11x17     otherwise in print settings just scale up
likewise you can always just scale down in the print settings
its that time of year again    since october and by association halloween is right around the corner lets post halloween themed papercraft origami and costume ideas/tips so we can help our fellow /po/lite friends     please no arguing this board is too slow for that shit    ill start with this wolf head i found in my folder and a question on whether i should do something like this or a helmet from skyrim
  ill also add this wizard and witch origami
friend of mine is looking for a wearable anubis mask anyone got any decent looking ones
  check out this anon    
  unfortunately the link is dead but hopefully this can give you some ideas i will keep looking for other masks also there are masks from the stargate series but not sure if that is what you are interested in
  anubis head from stargate    
  wwwmediafirecom/file/ulczgou0qg646m9
  this mask is from the game overwatch i believe    
tetravariations stuff is nice    baymanskathmamaildotcom
i dont want to make a thread for this so i am gonna put it here  
im trying to decide on what to make for halloween  either a helmet from skyrim or a mask of some sort i have no idea
  
  i have poor reading skills the post     the question was what to make not how to make it
  either a helmet from skyrim or a mask of some sort i have no idea  that is why there is a link to google for skyrim popercrafts to give you an idea
  this isnt a mask its some weird wolf pauldron that connects to a paper tshirt
  pepe mask  or has it been done before
  ah my mistake anon i thought it was cuase i was thumbnail scrolling for an image
tfw this thread is still here 3 months later  tfw it still has the spooky skeleton motif    slowest board
  halloween  btfo
bahahaaahahahahahahahaha
  kek
bahahahahaha
this thread is going to end up lasting until next halloween
  duderealtalk
  tfw im op  tfw thread still here     never change /po/
  you  still  here
  op
  well
  bump
  op here every so often i return to see if this thread is still here and so far i havent been dissapointed
is /po/ the slowest board  also why does this board exist
what is going on here
  i like knowing you keep an eye on it do you go on this board often
  ive heard people claim a few other boards were slower but this is one of the slowest we share papercraft templates origami diagrams and crease patterns and share works we make were a bunch of nerds for paper and this is a good place to be one
  i think /i/ is slower it often has older thread anyway    /u/ is also pretty slow but at this level comparison doesnt really matter all these boards are extremelly slow
  i love /po/and vist it at least once a week i normally lurk in the origami diagram threads and occasionally answer questions that pop up on /po/
  why are these boards kept around then i always thought /d/ was so slow because people are wacking it       i am glad you are still around hopefully we keep this going until next halloween
  theyre kept becuase slow as they are people still use em i guess
  i wish 4chan was known for its papercraft and origami board that would be so perfect     internet hate machine who loves to make swans
  maybe someday
  a man can dream anon a man can dream
  anyone excited for easter
cant let this thread die gotta last till this halloween
  yessss

  how do you make the hat
  halloween  oh cool  2016  wtf
fucking hell i knew this was a slow board but
does anyone still have the hello kitty halloween papercrafts that got taken down due to copyright i think i might on an old hard drive somewhere but i thought id ask before i break out storage
  no idea honestly im assuming theres a second page out there i dont have
can anyone hook a brother up with a zhelm
op here    meant to do this earlier but been busy with school    heres a folder with just about anything i have that could be considered somewhat halloween themed dude to my poor organizing skills  including but not limited to masks a couple of props for a gun and some skyrim shit and some origami     will be adding on to this and hopefully next year it will help more people    
  glad to see second year of this thread how you guys doing
  557656  keep this thread first post boys its halloween side note anyone have any pumpkin origami
hope everyone had a good halloween anyone make anything this year for it will be posting pics later
i love this thread so comfy
anyone got any like fish like these
test
  test what who here wants to make this their comfy oragami thread
  id rather not   i kinda wanna see if it can make it to 2018
its the perfect time to start preparing for next halloween
its 2018 and still this thread is alive
  how is everybody doing hope you are having a nice new year
  alive and well
every time i come here im amazed at how slow this board is
  the fact that we are still preparing for halloween 2016 in 2018 is amazing
  welcome to /po/
i check up on this thread every month or so im glad that its still alive and kicking
  of course
  i do too glad to know others are in on this i hope this stays for years feels comfy how you guys doing
  around here it is always halloween
does anyone have any ghost craft stuff
was the candy stuff on this board too
  i think there is some in   not sure though
  halloween 2016    god damn this board is slow
  every day is halloween 2016 in this board
  september 29 2016    wow /po/ i am impressed ill have to come by here more often and see if this thread makes it to halloween 2018
  they werent kidding about the early part
anyone got a roadhog mask pattern i will legit love you for ever
i want to make this one year when i get good    
why theres no new wintercuck torrent
    cute ideas i wonder if it would be possible to do a mask for halloween made out of this
anyone got a good knight helmet pattern  cant find any one that isnt roman or spartan
      
  how hard might this be if new
  skyrims dawnguard helm would definitely be easier id try that one first if you are new to papercraft and then try the other one after 
  papercraft is easy just connect it all together like a puzzle with instructions  my advice is just be precise and steady sloppy effort early on will affect it later
  thank you
  halloween is right around the corner need to start getting your masks now
does anyone have links to wcroft half masks have a masquerade ball this weekend and would love the fox or jackal
  im pretty sure all the croft shit is dead especially after he went on that take down frenzy

   feels good to see this is still around ive been away too long
been coming to 4chan for years this is literally the first time ive been here on purpose     thought id come in and ask about a dragon mask for my little girls costume but wow this board is something else
happy belated birthday to this thread it is now 2 years old      i have a dragon skull that can be used as a mask however its a bit much for a childs costume     i also have a much simpler fox mask as an alternative 
we are going to be so prepared for halloween 2018
  heres that and more  magnetxturnbtih7af0066c8731bda445d66e13a1d3c68b0a4e15dbdnwintercucktrudp3a2f2ftrackeristoleit3a6969trudp3a2f2ftrackerpublicbtcom3a80trudp3a2f2ftrackeropenbittorrentcom3a80trudp3a2f2fopendemoniicom3a1337
trying to figure out how to make something like this
  did you try their website
  how can i open it
  no luck seems simple enough where i should be able to just figure it out
this is my first time here and wow this thread is ancient im used to boards where if a thread is 3 or 4 days old its an accomplishment  this place is cozy though i feel like im tainting a sacred space with my presence or something
  nice to see this around still
anyone have pic related going to a witchthemed party and would be cool to turn up as black phillip
  send me a email man i have all the collecion
  thank you anon now i too can hold these for collection purposes
hello i hope you all had a happy halloween    ive recently organized the drive link   and i plan on adding more things to it for next year    will also be adding whats been put in this thread
  happy thanksgiving everyone
  omg i remember this thread when i was in high school
  weird to think this thread will be three years old soon
this guy on deviantart made this and it makes me cringe on more than one level  i just want to know if i am not the only one that feels that way
they just look like regular mana cards not holographic or old prints it may look stupid but it doesnt make me cringe at all
anyone playing for a while has more basic lands than what they know to do with when i was rebuilding my collection i bought 1000 for 5 from a store theyre basically worthless    as long as that deckbox can fit sleeves its a pretty neat idea i think it would have looked better if he had the card backs showing on the outside instead though
  nigga theyre basic lands and the books looks neat and well done its just you
  i think if the flap front back and sides represented each mana color it would be pretty neat
hi can you please watch my video please and tell me if you like my singing  thanks 
i like it
they dont fold very well and the printed ink flakes off after a while when folded like that those are my only complaints as i do not play magic nor do i know anything about it
he destroyed magic cards that makes me happy
  bending your cards  holy fuck i dont care how many cards you have bending them is a sin
  love books  get taught from a young age to treat books with tender care never bend pages leave them for the next generation  learn the same for comic books  handle carefully learn to read without ruining them with wrinkles  get job at borders after high school  doing inventory  anon these harlequins didnt sell this month strip their covers and box them up for the dumpster to make room for next months  watjpg  yeah tear the cover off like this preserving the bar code riiiiiiiiiiiip make a pile rubber band every 50 together for easy counting so we get refunded box up the books for d to take to the dumpster  mfw i am forced to perform ritual book and comic execution contrary to every collector instinct i have    it was like gore but not forgive me ray bradbury
  who cares theyre land cards theres like a billon of them for every other card grow the fuck up nerd like a man pussy
  why do you trash them instead of burn them of give them away why rip the cover off as well
  mana cards  its called lands anon its right there on the card
  if you purchased this book without a cover you should be aware that this book is stolen property it was reported as unsold and destroyed to the publisher and neither the author nor the publisher has received any payment for this stripped book
  nobody wanted to pay for it so absolutely nobody can have it because fuck sharing and fuck people      its like when foodstore put bleach on their unsold groceries so no hobo can eat them
  it makes bookkeeping easier for publishers bookstores report how many books went unsold and they are marked as such so it makes stolen merchandise harder to sell
        op mentioned more than one level of cringe give him more credit instead of stating the obivousits cringeworthy because its an ugly product of 10 seconds of an autistic 12yearolds imagination and 2 minutes of his labor        youre video is shit lul
  youre video is shit lul  you meant your of course
  dude theyre basic lands theyre not even full art people leave them on tables at card shops on top of the store owner giving them out for free     the only thing they did wrong was make it too small for sleeved cards
you may have autism if such a small thing can induce any sort of cringe its a neat little trinket made out of excessive lands thats all there is to it
    he probably thought he was cool for making that you should let him know what a fucking autistic fuckwit he is
  anime reaction image    opinion discarded
  theyre common inexpensive cards being used to create something useful and  i think  somewhat interesting i dont see your problem
  it bothers me that its all held together with bend cards if there was a better casing made from something else with the lands cut to size as decoration id be fine with it currently it just looks like crap where its bend and the flaps are completely useless
  i specifically selected that full frontal forest for my old sigarda commander deck before i dismantled it and sold it for food money
  
  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  congrats on creating the most autistic thread on a fucking papercraft and origami board
  youre on the slowest board on the chans and you still fuck up
  its my first time on this board it might not be elite folding prowess but as an mtg player i think its neat
  its still retarded it doesnt mean you couldnt mark them down as unsold and give them away regardless who the fuck would know if people arent going to buy it from the store and its going to end up as literal garbage i dont think the (((publishers))) need to worry about missing out on too many shekels from thieves selling them
  seriously shouldnt talk shit about this  he had an idea and saw it through  show me your first paper craft
  jesus christ i dont think id have the fortitude to keep that up
  stooooooooooooooooooooooooooop
  they do it because consumers are more sneaky and backhanded than you give them credit for the reason why produce is thrown away and not given away when it is going bad is because no sane person would buy the product if they could get it for free 4 days later its a counter productive business model that is centered around how consumers think
  nice proxy
        fake nerd bois not knowing what a bend test is
  i dont play magic but even i have heard of the black lotus
  you can add  to the mix
  are you that new
  mtg sellers bend cards to test if they are real or counterfeited  counterfeited cards usually bends and stay bent real cards are made of good quality materials and return to their normal shape spoiler at least for the first 3 times in their lifetime /spoiler      land cards are extremely low valueboth selling value and personal utility value in mtg and those are some of the ugliest forests ive ever seen  some stores even gift a pack of them to new players for free  he probably would have spent more by purchasing a small sheet of plastic/cardboard to make it
  as someone who volunteers at their local food bank and has also worked in a few retail/grocery stores i can verify that this is partially true  the other side of it is simply that many establishments are ignorant of what to do with old produce and throw it out ive heard stories of places that do indeed contaminate what they throw out but thats not exactly the norm  in the places ive been its pretty simple to just speak with the management and propose a deal with food banks most of them have the paperwork for it and the company gets to write it off its a winwin that the average person just doesnt think of    as for books and magazines well youre just shit out of luck its highly unlikely that the local library wants them as they also occasionally get rid of their own books as well obviously the interest isnt there if youre not selling them  in this day and age you just deal with it theres most likely a digital copy out there and you can rest easy knowing that theyre most likely going to be recycled
  i liked the unhinged land cardsmight be due to it having a full portrait which shows how good it looks
dah cards
  yeah and ung lands are like 10 bucks each you know
  the creator isnt pretending its gods gift to man hes not selling it on ebay he just posted it on deviantart to show off his idea    have a friend who works graveyard at chain supermarket  he always saves a trash bag of oneday expired frozen meals and hands them out to homeless people on his way home from work  homeless guy calls corporate and thanks them for good friends gifts  friend gets canned the next day  god bless our corporate overlords
  makes me cringe too it is all wrong
  care to explain how this upsets you      whats going on in this picture
  thats partly because hobos have sued companies mostly fast food places because they got food poisoning from their trash cans    am i still on /po/ this is starting to feel like another board
  except that grocery stores actually do donate some of that stuff there was a place next door to my grandfathers apartment that got donations from the supermarkets in the area of expiring food that old people could go in and grab for free
  the bend test will eventually ruin cards if done enough plus ive seen people fold cards in half to bendcheck them anyone whos played magic for a while knows how a card feels rendering the test unnecessary if i were looking to sell any card worth over 10 id hike the price 15x if they did the damned bend test
pretty funny how obvious it is to differentiate between people who play magic people who dont play magic and people who are pretending they play magic in this thread basic lands are fucking worthless and can be treated like toilet paper for all anyone should care making a deck box out of them is a cool and useful idea that should only be cringey because of the way it was crafted and the choice in art    now this this is a cringe worthy set of cards
  please please please tell me those arent real power 9 cards with art mods i fear it is based on the price tag why would anyone do this i cant believe anyone would throw away thousands of dollars of rare cards for my little pony while actually being aware of their value
  if someone buys them at that price doesnt it mean ponyshit art mod cards are worth just as much as the original cards both magic and mlp are fictional toy franchisesits not like a woc card with particular words and pictures on it is an inherently valuable object     basically it sounds like what you are saying is im jealous of someone who owned those cards and didnt use them for the purpose i wouldve liked to
  im extremely jealous because theyre the most valuable and rarest cards in mtg because of their limited print and their overpowered effects in the game itself modifying them makes them effectively worthless to a collector and no one would even think of buying those for that price without being completely retarded youre bitching that limited printed things which cant easily be obtained have value fictional toy franchises can still have a large domestic gross and as such be worth alot of money you troglodyte and none of your i dont care about that thing so its cost should be 0 has any affect on the market
  i dont at all mean to imply that things like rare magic cards dont or shouldnt have value rather im saying both mtg and mlp are niche interests with a number of extremely devoted fans who are clearly willing to pour quite a lot of money into their strange to outsiders hobby items appealing to these fans are certainly valuable because they can be sold at a high price yet to someone uninvolved in the hobby they would seem to be worthless     if you think defacing the cards in this way is a waste arent you essentially in the same position as some outsider who sees all magic cards as more or less worthless in the first place they have been removed from the sphere of things you care about but potentially become valuable and desirable to someone else     now of course its possible that the new niche for those defaced cards has become so small that there isnt actually anyone who is willing to buy them although i dont think any of us knows whether that is the case or not its also perfectly reasonable to argue that mlp fans especially ones who want to spend thousands of dollars on their hobby are annoying detestable etc but if you are someone who personally places a high value on paper cards from a fictional toy franchise such as mtg you might want to be careful about throwing stones
  if its what i think it is theyre making christmas tree decorations like baubles
  isnt it just basic lands whats the problem
  i knew someone worked at a pizza place used to put the mistake pizzas on some cardboard next to the dumpster so hobos could take them rather than ruin them place got fined and told to stop
hey this is somewhat unrelated but ive got a really annoying deck and it has nothing but tap target creature it doesnt untap during your opponents next untap step    now i figured being a complete dick wasnt enough so i came up with why not put on little snowmen on my opponents creatures to make them potentially completely lose their shit would love this one since it seems easy to craft and im shit at papercrafts but can honestly be anything snowflake xmas tree ice block i dont care just give me something relatively white i can print with relatively low color since im out of color tint     tldr id like a file for a simple snowman possibly pic related if not anything simple  ice related with not much color on it kkthxbai
what is up mah honky brethren
  there basic fucking lands the one thing that will never run out
  i honestly dont mind some of those alters the pearl and sapphire in particular look great    but i dont understand what the fuck posessed the guy to use real fucking moxen for it    i liked the lands though those are nice
im glad i never got into something as autistic as a tgc although ive spent a very large amount of time playing video games and watching anime which could probably be considered even more worthless
  tcg
  he says as he posts on the papercraft board
  at least the guru duals are pretty nifty
  giving them away would encourage people to not buy books and simply wait for the stock to be old its the same reason gamestop throws away video games    its not a practice i agree with but thats the way it is    they also rip the covers off to return to their vendor it acts as proof that the book didnt sell so they get refunded plus as another user stated its to prevent people from dumpster diving and reselling trashed booked which is a problem due to the first thing i said    theres nothing to stop you from getting the books out of the dumpster for yourself however unless youre above dumpster diving
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    
    is there a way i can get free books and games that people are about to bin
  at least hes only fucking up lands honestly i think its a neat idea if he managed to make the cuts a bit better and figure out a better way to crease the lid it could probably look really sweet
      lmao goteem
    op did u make dis 3
portal land cards    i havent played mtg since like 1999 but even then those things were worth a nickel
  my brother cut out the picture of hundreds of those cards back in 95 and stuck them on his wall ruined the wall
  those are not portal lands
  nnnnecroed
  no way that is real thats the most cringe worthy defacement ive ever seen
  spoilerspike dies/spoiler
  i hope im not too late for the screen cap
bumped for cringe
  hey anon i saw this thread and made this for you  tube snowmen because you said you were shit at papercrafts  two designs with and without top hat  edit if you want  the face of the snowman just tells me  yeah youre screwed  you are just gonna sith through this  fuck you
  i kinda like it
  not sleeving his cards  makes me wanna tear my hair out
  this looks like shit fuck you you fucking motherfucker
  thats a retarded way of losing thousands of dollars
  it wont crease if its legit
  white border  who cares
  looks pretty cool desu
  paper folding board  gets triggered by a picture of paper being folded
  yes you do
  cccardstock you bbaka
  the slowest board on the chans  wouldnt that be /t/
  what did that say before they deleted it
it could have been better if he scored the card properly
  incredibly cringy deviantart color me surprised but at least he trashed scars of mirrodin lands nothing of value was lost
    youre so full of shit
    well anon hasnt responded yet and i think he may have given up on this thread  yes i do check back on this thread to see if anon has responded
  fucking kicking a wall with a nail under my nailbed
    dude is that a tormods crypt in the background
  post i made over 400 days ago  still here  /po/ is even slower than i expected
  its a bunch of land cards if they defile a black lotus then thats fucking heresy
  didnt you notice  then
  ᶦᵗˢ ᵍᵉᵗᵗᶦᶰᵍ ᶜᶫᵒˢᵉ
was thinking what the fuck is this thread related to politics then i releasied im on /po/  lol what a gay board
  /po/ is ironically the best and most cute board on 4chan
  12000 for horribly cropped cards    reminds of the bootleg yugi cards i bought as a kid at an open air market in florida  good times  aside from chickens and muggings
why do you care its some painted paper from some shitty game
  dont you guys have sex with paper or something  isnt this haram
  as a magic player i think it looks pretty dumb
  this makes me happy for some reason
  no crease no problem grab a common card and try yourself
  bend tests are useless with good counterfeits and puts a lot of stress in the card    use a good testing like light ones or a decent magnifier to check the print    if you ever try to bend one of my moxes id fucking kill you
  a deck case made out of mana cards i dunno looks fine to me i think i may even like that someone did that xd
  you have to tearing off the cover proves to publisher they were destroyed not sold its a business/copyright thing
  theres a huge liability problem with giving out expired food if your friend wanted to do a good deed he could just buy it in date with his employee discount rather than feed people trash    its a thing because otherwise you get corporations getting a tax writeoff for freezer meltdowns that arent actually safe to eat or well meaning idiots poisoning people    the bigger problem is that canada actually destroys fresh drinkable milk to keep prices up because of how their subsidies are done literally dumps hundreds of gallons of the stuff down the drain rather than seize it for poor people or how usa uts funding to states that try to tell you what you can or cant buy with foodstamps
  you bendtest one of my cards youve just doubled the price that shit damages them long term put the money on the table before you touch it and guarantee youre buying if it passes no weaseling out or changing your mind
  would be cooler if it was a cigarette box
  mtg bondage edition  intriguing
  it was that employees solo action i seriously doubt thatd create a legal liability for the company  unless the company is under legal obligation to make every reasonable effort to prevent people from accessing their expired food then its a problem
    even if it was a problem of liability a lot of food is good even days or week after expiry yogurts for example  in my country some stores were pourring bleach on the food they throwed away to be sure no one would eat it this is illegal now and they are supposed to give away their unsold food aid association food for animals compost etc
  the bigger problem is that canada actually destroys fresh drinkable milk to keep prices up because of how their subsidies are done  what the fuck
  o
  its cringeworthy because its an ugly product of 10 seconds of an autistic 12yearolds imagination and 2 minutes of his labor  does that make it any less valid as a papercraft it brings happiness to the person using it and a thats kind of neat reaction to some people that see it
  theyre basic fucking lands
dis tread from 2016 still up and kickin lol
  just wanted to reply to a two year old thread i wont shitpost again i promise    f o l d i n g  o  l  d  i  n  g
  he meant it in the context like youre waifu a shit bro
  i think its cool
  cardgames are actually pretty fun sociable and strategic aside from the money part depending on what you played and watched id say youre miles below
why does this thread still exist
posting in ancient thread
        just goes to show how sparse /po/ is in terms of daily visits theres a paper planes thread thats even older than this one thats still kicking albeit not for much longer considering it just recently reached its bump limit
  it bother me that people bend mirrodin cards 
    hows life treated you these past 1 and a half years
  ok ive never been to this board but i wanted to post in a two year old thread
  holy shit me too
  its just fucking lands also if i recall blue is useless unless you have a shit ton of counters so the island is worth zero
  also fuck your opponent with goblins its the cheapest effective solution
  this doesnt work for modern cards they bend in the pack
would look dope with guru lands
  lord garfield has spoken
  ha
  what angry god would let that happen i ask because its happened to me twice my parents threw away my collections the first time was vintage heavy and had guru lands the second was original zendikar era with tier 0 decks
  he obviously doesnt play magic anon
  aat least its not paper
magic gore thread  based board
  iirc you get refunded for destroyed and unsold books
  theres a huge liability problem with giving out expired food  best before does not mean lethal after     best before dates are there to keep a product on the shelves and then replace it with a new and improved product they have very little to do with consumer safety
   both magic and mlp are fictional toy franchises    arent the both owned by hasbro      owner hasbro      type subsidiary of hasbro
please please someone kill this thread or something please i cant see it anymore
  see that  icon next to the thread click that problem solved
  i bought 1000 for 5 from a store  you got ripped off my lgss give out lands for free
  a sensible bookstore chuckle
  this is absolutely true there is no argument for bending them     op is right  /thread
  based deck card thread
  implying 4chan isnt autism the website
so im a little late to the party i know but whats up with the pedo shit and mtg
  cards are good to cut not to bend  if you bend it will happen that broke white back
  this is an abomination
the autist in me thinks its fucking awsome   i would literally pay 10 for this just to start playing magic again
  you should lurk some more
  you replied to a 2 year old post
  its cringeworthy because its an ugly product of 10 seconds of an autistic 12yearolds imagination and 2 minutes of his labor    for something to be cringeworthy we need more information or just make assumptions of the context my guess is that you are doing the latter the only way this is cringe is if the author is proposing it as a great idea are you the kind of person that needs to make sure something is great before sharing it
  kek
  this is so hot
  bit late to the party but it was a post trying to get trips
  i guess youll really cringe at my cubes then the book trash origami has the instructions on how to defile all your business and playing cards
                           all these people who dont realize you can bend test a 5 counterfeit black lotus    ii was pretending to be stupid
i havent been to /po/ in ages and decided to check in i remembered ops image and thought it had become a meme    its the same thread
  this is neat dont be such a wimp
  that sounds interesting do you have a pdf to share for that book
  final sin was not leaving backsides facing out
  tf this comment is 2 years old is anon even alive
  is this ugin melting      moderately played my brother sat on it but still sleeve playable 120
how in the hell did a thread from 2016 survive to 2018 am i going to see this thread in 2019 too
  given that its barely halfway to the bump limit i reckon yes also you should use sage when not posting something important to not increase the bump count
  a board so slow you actually have to use sage mindfully  fucking ace
only one reply was made to this thread in all of october  this has to be the slowest board on 4chan
  for deviantart standards this is very low cringe
  the most costeffective way  lol thats what i did cards costed a fuckton until you got some killer deck so i decided to just buy a couple of red decks and swarm the opponents with these   tax cards blue and white that force you to pay a tax for each attacking creature are an absolute killer of these decks and so are table sweepers white and black
hey /po/ does anyone have the link to this folder        it was shared on some archived posts and has worked fine until today now it just gives me a 404 whenever i open it it disappeared from where i saved it to my drive too so im expecting the original author probably got rid of it or something
would help if i knew what it wasauthor and subject  it would be filed and given its own folder
new square of origami paper folded precisely corner to corner completely flat  fuck
  every time
  lolwut
happens to me all the time any tips plz
    here is my technique it works pretty well for me you need a scalpel a straightedge and a cutting mat with a grid patern    once your sheet of paper is prepped cut one thin strip close to one edge of your sheet this will ensure that this side is perfectly straight  align this perfectly straight edge with the vertical line of the grid and use horizontal lines and straight edge to cut a right angle  you now have two perfectly straight edges of paper forming a perfect right angle fold the right angle in half now the two straight edges of paper are one on top of the other  align these two straight edges of paper with the vertical line of the grid and use the straightedge and grid to make a cut perpendicular to the two superposed straight edges     you now have a square if done correctly its virtually perfect the origami paper that are sold are usually poor quality square and you often need to recut them
  thanks i tried this but my square still turned out off by 2mm
paper from origami shop arrives  the big sheets were pretty sharply folded in half and in half again and not even precisely  what are they even thinking what if i wanted to make a tesselation from a hexagonal grid on one of those sheets
  screw that id never shop for paper there again and id tell everyone and their mother not to either
  something about the monopoly that store has on everything from paper to books in this hobby seems really fucking weird to me this shit is just another issue of many with them
  i wish i could but they have papers which are impossible to find anywhere else
tipbuy a dressmakers ruler or matt with a the measurements in it then you can make perfect squares
spend a lot of time making something  fuck up in the last few steps
origami paper  cant even spread the wings of the crane because it tore when tried to do it only slightly  even printer paper works better for a crane than this
  also  same kind of origami paper  this happens to jeremy shafers warrior crane basically a simple flapping bird after light usage  and the tear isnt even on the modified side
    origami on the tag doesnt imply anything about its quality
  then you need check your instruments or to git gud son
nicolas terry tissue foil  fold tadashi moris darkness dragon 2  too thick  i was scared that the back was going to tear fortunately it didnt but the legs are stupid thick i dont even think itd make sense to finish it
  nigga you cant even make a crane
  oh yeah
hello i have been lurking here for a while and thought that origami was really cool and that i want to do it myself however i do not know where to begin any help would be greatly appreciated
  just going to copy and paste here let me know if this isnt enough        airplanes are probably the best introduction since you can fly it when you finish and the folds are simple while teaching you to read diagrams    then try learning inside reverse fold outside reverse fold crimp pleating and fold the bases here 
 rhanks a lot
  boats planes the mount fuji one here     plenty really im new to the hobby actually just started today all of these are fairly easy then reverse fold is one you have to learn  and maybe in about a week try a crane
  try pic related
i want to into origami so bad but im totally lost and no tutorials are detailed enough kinda like those stupid ass tutorials that teaches you how to draw
  you cant possibly fuck this up      not detailed enough  just fold it like in the pic     just start with easy stuff
  i folded it like in the picture and ruined it
  
    kek wtf is wrong with you    no wait its not fucked up you just have to fold the ear down to make a face
  try again or   the red circle is the nose fold it down to be in the middle of the face
  nice dubs
op here thanks a lot guys youve been really helpful 
  no we havent wtf
      what in the absolute fuck is this step trying to show    why the fuck cant i learn origami i dont know where to start  i dont even have any fucking paper
  if youre still here ive made this clip to help you if you need help just ask me but keep in mind that /po/ is a slow board
  thank you i wish i had paper i have none not even printer or snything    i want to but cheap but decent origami paper
anything i can fold with standard a4 paper  dumb question of course but i noticed the fox is a proper square piece of paper
  craaaaaaaaaaaaaaanes  once you know how to fold them youll make a ton of them
when i was a kid i got some books pic related used to be my personal favorite it has models from beginners to more advanced the book uses all basic folding techniques at some point and it provides you with designed paper it has easy to follow instructions for the most part and is how i got good at origami     although at the time i didnt have internet so the internet is probally a better option and has a better variety i personally think getting some books is the way to go
  cute hands    cute webm
this xfaced cube is the ultimate beginner project if you need a book get the color photo book by the late rick beech his book is aesthetically pleasing vs intimidating blueprintlike directions
  i had that book too
  nice
  hey thanks for the clip im not the op but it helped me im not very good at reading diagrams yet can you record the whole processthanks
  i filmed it but its too big to upload here it is 
  sorry  
  so many thanksthis made my day
  the advantages of easy origami are twofold
aight start with some advanced paper figures like shenron paper figure
ran across the fox fold on the home page never ever have done oragamia/paper folding before but saw this thread was for beginners     tried it it was kinda fun but i need square paper and/or a ruler because these foxes look retarded
  t nilso
learn yoshizawarandlett system of diagramming should be available onlibe if not most books have an intro to reading diagrams may sound voring but itll help in the long run     watch happyfolding on youtube really good intro course     if you want to do complex models you might want to learn cp however the other two steps come first
  use tissue paper from a local store you need 2 pieces of tissue glue and a flat surface it really makes good paper especially double coloued
bump
there are many youtube tutorials out there for beginners i would just start with one of those
  if anything in this thread didnt help you coukd you specify what you need help with
  i bought this today and i had to look up how to make a crane on youtube anyway
  you can easily turn printer paper into square paper here  
      
how do i origami with toilet paper
    most models arent fit for thick paper that doesnt fold very well but theres a waterlilly/lotus model that might work with tp
we should really have a sticky with  this info ya know
  man this is comfy as hell
making paper crane is so difficult for beginner
  look for alizee glasser origami she makes lots of toilet paper models
  yeah i tried and it only looks good if i hold it together i think it is supposed to stand on its own
  nice crane
making straight folds is harder than i thought it would be
  cant you just do it with some scissors  like this 
  stop biting your nails its disgusting
  i made this quite happy with it
    dont mess with the freaking crane this cube is the easiest good looking model you will ever fold
bumping nice old thread   made me some nice memories
where do you guys buy paper i need some larger paper but its all decorative i just need some 30x30 plain paper
does anyone have a paper craft for smash 64 mario that isnt the fire ball one preferably just a neutral pose would be nice
no thread hidden get fucked
  something like this
  also is this the one you dont want
neither of these are what i want i want the smash 64 mario
  the download links are dead but this might be a good jumping point
  this is all thats available take it or leave it
  pray for my kike money though
    can someone backup every craft in the website it will close really soon and it would be a shame to lose this many good templates
  wow that sucks ass its gone for me along with all subpages
so did anyone save their pdfs the wayback machine didnt save all urls
  nevermind it did store the pdfs i was just accessing an old archive
  if the whole website is stored anywhere it can be rehosted by someone
  the copy on september 25    
just made my first origami craft o call it the praying mantis    whatcha think
thats not origami but it does look nice and surprisingly reminiscent of a praying mantis
  looks like shit dumbass youre a funny guy
  its glorious you really have a lot of talent op
has anyone done a print from hoborginc im looking to use pic related for cosplay but im not sure how to harden it so if someone where to step on it it wouldnt be destroyed i know how to resinbondo and rondo but not on a scale this small how would i go about hardening it
  nice
  try applying thin coats of epoxy from inside of each part and continue doing that until desired thicknessalso dont take my advice im autistic
  how much of this did you think this throughbecause what tool and how am i supposed to get the insides of this grip covered in epoxy
  also how is your jpg /po/ related
  maybe some sort of a disposable spray thingyor a soft brush
imo any papercraft guns or small items are mainly just show pieces and not really meant to be carried around all the time hardening it with epoxy would just bleed through the paper and make it look like someone rubbed grease all over it my recommendation is to just buy a cheap toy pistol and paint over it there are many tutorials on this such as      if you really wanted to make it out of paper it would have to be done buy hand using a method which involves gluing layers of paper together to create a hard material   
  absolutely does not belong is this board there is a weapons board you know
  surprised nobodys posted any of konigstiger93s videos in this thread paper guns that actually kinda work  
  thats not a real weapon silly its a papercraft model of one   /k/ doesnt have anything to do with this kind of project  whats wrong with you hahaha
  peboabbep  cnctembl  haraha    wut
  ok ok it means revolver systems and then the last word i think is spelled wrong but i think its supposed to mean nagant as in mosinnagant the arms manufacturer
  hey op you have any as val templates
    theres also tacome1942 who uses this technique
this pajeet has great weapons    
does anyone have any templates for this it seems pretty tough but i think i can do it
  bump
  that is a picture of st peters anon
how do i make a turret for my paper tank

    in good quality  take them or leave them  are good enough if you are really going to fold the models if you are not going to fold any of them then quality doesnt matter
olympiad 2018

  oh hey thanks fernando
wish there was a torrent with all these books people post on this board
  what are you waiting for create that torrent and share it here
  wish i could but theres a lot of links in the archive that are now dead so anything i could make would be way too incomplete
  thanks 
can anyone share czech origami society 2016 and 2017 
  no
interesting tanteidan releases magazines and convention books are available online soon after first publishing  does it proofs that japanese people are more generous than west world individuals
  no it is only because those books are the most famous and/or wanted for some reasons  also the magazines are often first shared by a nonjapanese
  thanks for the gorilla mask i can get busy forthwith
  
  in fact by a spaniard
  thank you thank you thank you
  i would say ousa/cos 2017 convention books are as well famous/wanted among folders but if you  ask for it it is more likely that youll get no from someone    and if you ask for new 2018 issue of tanteidan magazine youll probably get it pretty soon
someone have a origami works of fumiaki kawahata
hello i am an english with a long member of wood as a knight that i am asked for a book of origami from the korean group is of the convention 2018 would you be so lovable to pay it or pass the link 
someone have a origami pro 4
    no      hell no asshole who folded
  there you go another western world individual 
does anyone have langs insects ii
  any particular model you are looking for 
  it is here        it only took a few seconds to google it
  it only took a few seconds to google it  you should tell him to google it instead of posting it here next time he will just ask for something else without searching it first
i did a quick google before posting and the only thing i saw was scribd that site doesnt let you download the pdf unless you pay im looking for a copy of the book
  they dont charge anything you just have to sign up upload something and then you can download  its like an exchange thing
  i did a quick google before posting  well insects 2 is in scrbd and is free so what can you say except you did a lousy search most likely because you expect some other people will do the job for you
  another trick with scribd is to go to the file you want scroll down each page of the file even if its a  preview with many of the pages missing and when you reach the last page right click your mouse  and click on save as web page complete and it will save all the images to a zip file then you can create your own pdf from the images
  another trick  thats a neat trick thanks for sharing this technique
thats a neat trick someone sent me the link if anybody needs this heres the link    
  oops sorry i meant it saves all the images to a single folder not a zip file be sure to save it to your desktop so you can find it easier  create a new folder to put all the images in so you can separate them from all the other junk that comes with them then create your own pdf
so quiet here  everyone is busy folding to try to qualify for 2nd round of ioio
  no one here actually folds anything we just hoard books
  no one here actually folds anything  speak for yourself asshole    we just hoard books  what you got a mouse in your pocket  be careful with that we word
  speak for yourself  yeah show your productions t shut him up
  you got him there well done
  you got him there   
  
  in a bunch of parts  100 gold coins   you need to buy this attachment   cant download  dropped

the books that most people want are     olympiaid 2018 not out yet  origami pro 4 not out yet  cos 2017 wait and download all the 10 files     korea convention 2014 not raison d etre
wanted to see how long itd take to upload something so i uploaded ioios 2011 to 2017    password is ioio  took too long so i dont think ill be able to make a torrent of my whole collection for everyone to use but i dont really have anything thats hard to find anyway
  took too long so i dont think   google drive is much much faster than mediafire at least for me its almost like saving to a local hard disk where are you
  another great book that is not public yet is usa convention 2017 i think its time
oriland starry revolution anyone
  another great book that is not public yet is usa convention 2017  for your information both usaorigami convention 2017 and 2018 have been leaked in some other site

  i would love to have the rings and spiral version of the swirl star torus and ray star torus  sorry if my question isnt clear  thank you 
  thing is my upload speed is complete garbage actual dialup tier so itll take days to upload a few gbs despite my download speed being decent guess i got jewed by my isp  if my collection ever gets to be something worth torrenting ill just put it on a usb go to a cyber cafe dump it all on a pc create a torrent and leave it seeding im 100 sure no one will ever notice  so far most of my shit is from that one anons google drive folder but im slowly adding shit i find if anyone knows of folders and zips with good stuff post them here and ill add them to my collection once it hits 10 gb ill for sure torrent it like i said in the last paragraph
  ill for sure torrent it like i said  dear sir you are one kind and generous person wish you build up your collection soon

  my laziness found it   
someone have a most new pajarita magazine
anyone have a origami korean convention 2018
i need this book please
anyone have this book
  anyone have these books
anyone notice the origami community is almost dead
  yeah but the papercrap papercraft bullshit aint doing much better
  good to hear ive hidden all the papercraft threads off /po/ long ago i am left with a more tolerable but excruciatingly slow origami community
  honestly it looks like its gonna stay that way or get even slower
  probably because there are so many uneducated kids that start drama
  not only that no one wants to share anything  everyone just wants to hoard everything
  new people just arent too interested in getting into it
anybody got bogota 2016 cant seem to find it
  theres a lot of barriers to entry if you want to do anything more than easy af youtube shit to the point that most people dont even know whats possible with origami those that do usually reach a point of frustration and quit because no one wants to share anything and the ones that do figure stuff out then dont want to help others i had to figure it out so you can too the community doesnt help itself desu
the wisest course of action to take is to join zhezhixieyuan and exvagos to get free books also scribd  facebook groups and reddit  asking for help with with one model and ask for one subject instead of whole books
i want a book called rudegami by oliver zachary
  good luck with that
  /po/ should just become a general arts and crafts board with an origami general or 2
  really we have people stoking division here that we should be split it a papercraft board and an origami everyones pulling in different directions it seems maybe that justifies that status quo
  because this board is slow enough as it is anyone saying to split it is either joking or completely retarded
  zhezhixieyuan  damn shit gives me a blank page when i try to register do i need a chinese vpn
  yeah this is a good idea what about we just start posting other kinds of crafts
  we need a bigger posterbase so it wont do much good if its just the same 10 people on here posting we need hiro to officially change the name of the board if he even knows this board exists
  this bullshit is only related to /po/ and in no way to the origami community at large  there are many helpful forums in different languages i dont even include sharing forums in those associations and conventions all year round in lots of countries magazines from those associations etc    so anyone really wanting/needing help can find it probably not here though  the origami community is strong and helpful but /po/ is not a part of it as mentioned many times in this thread here is about hoarding books and diagrams not about folding
  i thought origami subreddit was pretty bad and casual
  most that come on here only want help or search for one model but get sucked into the collective freeness  anyhow scribd is offering 3mnth trial so if you arent satisfy cancel after a healthy test run
having said that origamiusaorg is a site that memberships begin at 30 dollar a year you get access to articles and diagrams but now i guess they need donations a lot of you guys are in jobs and careers so be nice and throw some coins their way  
origami is a craft that many pick up early and like other arts of its not encouraged them they often fall off by senior school due to pressures of choosing serious subjects  however theres another milestone in that by the time college exams come along literally most that given up paperfolding maybe friends found it embarrassing or impracticalthere again you get a huge drop off of online followers that may or may not come back to the art formdepending on what is expected of them
  pls its just a origami site i would load that link in a heartbeat
  flickr too all godlike folders are gone
i used to think some time ago that innovation in origami and the attention span of artists is finite maybe i was right    on a scale of 0 to do the needful how indian are you
  what happened to them    i use to follow and be active in the community back in 20082013 i went to showings and a few ousa i also shitposted edgy things here as this was my main board now i come only once or twice a year to check new models from the otms the thing that turned me away was seeing a bunch of poor over designed boxpleat models that along with school made me lose interest
  a bunch of poor over designed boxpleat models  this a thousand times i mean just look at this abomination
does anyone have korean masterpiece 2017
  all those folds just for it to look mediocre lmao unless it looks way different in real life
  not only that but the paper is really thick on the back seriously ive folded so many models that looked nice on paper had about 2040 simple steps but nothing could warn me of how thick and ugly the model would turn out
  obelisk is still folding as is sebastian limetneelesh kumaar  this chinese site has a lot of new folders that are doing original subjectsanime characters being my favourite category because few can fold humans convincingly    
i like human figure origami my recent fold of neelesh k design
      not even that all the god like origami requires glue you can make some without glue and do your best to wetfold it
everything
  seconded
can someone help with a reference points for this little guy  i tried with referencefinder but with no satisfying results
  how do you know there are no references for some of that points
  ok thanks have you folded it yet  it seems that most complicated part is that marked hexagon looks like closed or open sink is it
  because i am a pro  and a braggart and an asshole a little courtesy goes a long way you dont need to curse people for asking simple questions not everyone can fold from a cp
  there you go being the biggest dick in the forum again people like you shouldnt even exist oh  and btw im not the person who asked for the help mother fucker
  that would put me on the same asshole level as you and id rather not be there after this message i am done with you so you can say whatever you want but you wont get another response im tired of communicating with a dickhead like you
my apologies to the opening poster for myself and the jackass            who thinks hes better than everyone else in here youre gong to get people like that quite often
  you did not fold it
  hurr durr fucking moron    i am the best paperfolder in the wolrd hur dur
  next time be nice to those who dont know how to fold cps    teach instead of being an idiot
screenshot of the removed comments from the archive
heres the folded model that the deleted poster made it looks helpful to get the structure of the model
  ok so i tried folding this and failed miserably lol its not easy at all
  we start with too perfect diagonal bisector sthen try a rabbit ear on each halfwhere the line meets the edge your fourth fifth referencethen find the parallel you should now have your 90 once you have those most simple models are 45225 after thatdo anything obviously symmetrical rather than adding box gridsusually after you be mastered that pattern you can look out for 60 ref lines
  i know ive seen this in an origami magazine before a diagram in a parajita was it 139 ill look for it

hi /po/ first time posting  how to bend paper
  with your hands m8
  quality thread to follow
566778    start here     
  i asked before i still dont know
  use your xacto and start by gently applying it to the paper
make the extremities of the paper match theb press your finger at the center of the fold and then slide it to right and left thats the way ive learned workong for a cartotecnic firm
also new what are the people like on this board
  polite mild mannered practical go to page 1 and progress to 2 3 4 then youll get an idea
you cant dumbass itll shatter if youre not careful
bend over and place paper between the cheeks
  youll need to use a heat gun to soften the paper before bending it
hey /po/ i dont normally step on this board but i just finished watching the wind rises and i was wondering do you guys know how to make the paper plane depicted on pic related sorry for the shitty quality btw  any help is very apreciated
2nd plane same request
  the vtail on that looks pretty simple enough but not sure how the main wings are attached nose looks like the paper is folded on itself for nose weight      nice gull wings the nose seems to have a paperclip kind of paperweight the tail seems to be two parts at least i think
  crashing no survivors
the one in op should be pretty simple  the whole plane is cut from a single sheet wings and tail find all already attached to the fuselage  the nose should be made extra long and folded a few times on itself  then the plane is folded in half  the wings are then folded down at the root    the second one doesnt seem made from paper but rather from balsa wood or polystyrene
  tail fins
im not sure if this is the right board for this but i was wondering if anyone would happen to have an english translation of the instructions inside the howls moving castle papercraft book pic is of book
some of the instructions
  why are those instructions in chinese when the cover is in japanese
  i think it is a chinese reprint i have seen them on ebay and etsy i want one
show off help out critique watcha got /po/ 
last one ive got that i folded
  it really needs some ironing    the yellow one is horrible the blue one looks passable from a distance
    yellow was my test piece the one blue was my first 32x32 grid attempt i love the backlighting in yours what pattern is it

does origami help getting a gf
  not in acquiring gf but periodical minigifts with decent amount of effort are good ways to retain gf
  if a girl is interested in you then shell be interested in anything youre passionate about     if shes not interested dont try and push gifts on her itll only turn her off further do your own thing improve yourself and others will be drawn to you
yes
  depends on the girl
  its not a guarantee or anything but yes  folding shit for her out of receipts or pamphlets whatever when youre waiting around is usually going to elicit a positive reaction i gave my ex some kawasaki roses for her birthday and she loved it
youd have to be really good at origami in fact exceptionally good youd have to make goddamn dragons
  shut the fuck up you virgin retard
  girls really like it if you can bring them to origami
  i once folded a napkin rose for a girl which is quite easy and looks amazing if done correctly she was really impressed
  no but it can give you some confidence and stuff to be proud in which helps self esteem pretty well which aids you in finding people to connect to    fun hobbies are more fun to talk about than nonstop gaming
  this is what i was trying to say in my post women like men who like themselves and have something that interests them besides her     thats why nice guys fail they think that sucking up and making it all about them will make a girl like them but nobody likes a kissass
  honestly papercraft got me out of my niceguy stage and ive found plenty of hobbies to tide me over since     been a good ride
  apt summary best most concise advice
not really i suppose its more impressive than juggling or card tricks    only skill aside from being a functional human being im aware of that will get you a gf is playing a cool musical instrument and that relationship will also suck unless youre a functional human being
origami gets you lots of attention but dont make it seem like you do origami for attention for two reasons one they will pick up on it subconsciously and dislike you for it and two origami should be about the folding and not about impressing people    origami is the closest thing to sacred geometry in every day practice if you arent a nasa bro really spiritual dont pervert it with pursuit of women that you probably wont be compatable with if they are drawn to you because you make a pretty flower
women just steal ur gamis bro i made a complex rocket ship and my sister stole it so i made another one and gf stole it if ur good enough theyll dig it but more than that they just want ur hard work
  this 100
  fuck off you goddamn retard
  honestly likely not for most girls ive always thought origami was a girly activity   t femanon whos been folding since age 8
  its odd that you say that considering the majority of it practitioners are male perhaps its due to it being less physical
  can you post diagram for pic i really wanna fold it
  if it doesnt shes not the one for you lad
  without a doubt if i were single and a whoremonger i would have no problem getting a girlfriend of 8/10 or above anything below is an automatic acquisition these females melt over the simplest cutesy origami model i even had a few real pretty married milfs come on to me gotta be careful with the origami fire
  maybe become a serial killer   refer to heavy rain
  do your own thing improve yourself and others will be drawn to you  aka being a beta cuck 101  you wont draw anyone by tending to your passions and shit girls wont make the move on you you have to make the move on them i dont know who the fuck came up with this retarded idea that girls will come to you if youre good enough but you need to stop spreading this shit this is why a lot of people on 4chan say its fucking hard to get a girl despite the numerical superiority of women alphas wont give a shit about your sorry ass and will keep adding girls to their harem and this passive behavior thats being spread around by people like you only help them    if you want some real advice here it is  go work out and keep yourself in shape  chop off that long hair if you have it you look like a faggot with that shit  start talking to girls and new people more often so you can get over that social anxiety for once
hell yeah    i taught a friend some origami which he used to woo a date in france    and it worked although it doent travel well /
no    what are you going to dofold a paper rose to pick up a girl in a bar   might as well paint a big l on your face
do origami in class  when a girl passes by i get anxious that she thinks that i am doing it to look interesting  what do i even do in this situation i just want to fold in peace    also i am bumping origami threads so that papercraft threads disappear off page 1
  since op is obviously a queer of some kind does anyone the diagram or crease pattern of this
  seconded i cant find shit on this model via google 
it got me laid once but the girl was actually clinically insane not in the crazy ex who you call crazy because the relationship didnt go too well kind of way either like actually in and out of mental hospitals and rehab centers kind of crazy
what model is the most effective do girls appreciate complex models more can a girls feeble mind even comprehend the beauty of a tessellation for example should we just stop chasing the carrot on a stick held by the vagina jew riding us all and just give up
  fucking gami goblins
  a girl who appreciates origami is able to fold nice models or is learning may be a bit more receptive to another folder you should be able to start as folding buddies and slowly become close friends or a relationship develops
reverse searching led me to a deleted youtube video so this is how i think the topic model is made make 8 of them and lock them together i inverted the colors in the gif by accident but i think you guys can figure it out hope this helps
  show girl something i folded  nice how many pieces of paper is it made of  uh only one  huh
i think waitress/bellboy type origami like folded roses works to get herbut if you messing with her dont play with her heart or her  her mamas relationshipbe yourself and you know have fun  henry pham has loads of pikachu and obelisk does anime girls
  this except my gf is the origami nut this is the first time ive been on this board and im prolly not coming back lol  pic related every time i see that lil dino i remember her folding it for me as we were cuddling
  the gf i have now i got from being myself didnt make any opening moves except talking to her she started handing me notes every other day with cute/uplifting drawings on them until one day one had her number  not to mention been asked to a few girls choice dances and ive done literally nothing except do my thing
  i think you are henry pham you keep shilling that channel and your posts are easily recognizable because you type like an indian    is that the tapping clapping yapping etc trex by jeremy shafer    just bee urself my dude 
some girls like artsy guys but if shes artsy herself that maybe too much sameness  i used to draw and was good at it i think shed get pissed off you spending more time on cps than her
  ahahhaah u know nothing i had at least 45 times when some girls gave me a chance thank a dragon
  not if youre ugly
  starts off with potentially good advice about being assertive and approaching girls which is in fact not mutually exclusive with improving yourself but complementary to it  shits the bed with the same superficial getyourlifetogether starter pack advice pushed on /fit/ and /fa/    the only good point there is talking to girls and new people more often   believe it or not other people are also insecure and even if theyre more attractive they can always find something to feel insecure about they key is to be confident and assertive if necessary around other people and that comes from practice more than anything if you want to look good for yourself thats great but if you dont learn how to feel confident regardless of your looks youll become overly reliant on them and youll just be a slightly better looking socially awkward guy or you can go for plastic surgery until youre a 10/10 but then what if youre not as tall or as muscular as the other guys the issue with confidence must be addressed from within have you ever met scrawny average or fat people who were popular and had girlfriends what about people with long hair no hair or mohawks ive known all these kinds of popular and social people far more often than ive met of the fit and buzzcut variety   looking good might make more people receptive to you but if you have the personality of a log and cant keep a conversation going with anyone no ones going to waste their time with you
maybe i was given an origami rose that i kept till the guy who gave me reveal himself to be such a douchebag i threw it away    its icing on the cake but the cake still has to be nice
  but periodical minigifts with decent amount of effort are good ways to retain gf    my brother bulk brought craft jewellery he keeps on hand for such a reason when he was in college
i did some origami and i still dont have a gf  life sucks u make good origami and the girls dont come to you
  its a good icebreaker to get girls to talk to you but from there its up to you to make her a gf
  it can be great on a date as youre chatting fold up a napkin or leaflet or something into an interesting pattern and dont draw attention to it it makes for a great convocation piece
this thread is for all the fold up toys projects whether they be free downloadable paper crafts building videos or website updates rather than trying to put the releases into other threads i figured itd be easier to keep them all contained in just one     also if you want to share you fut builds thatd be great
to start the thread off heres a video showing off some of my limited edition and signed paper toys ive collected over the years these are just thenbuilt templates ive had in storage but soon ill be building a lot of these special items    
this commission project for vrprosthetics is now available for public download     featuring vr goggles and a prosthetic hand this model was originally printed and diecut for a prosthetics promotional event by hallam university these preprinted and cut models were handed out to guests of the event    
his commission project for hoe works is now available for public download     forge is a simple paper toy created for a musical visual event at hope works in 2016 as part of the sheffield year of making hope works teamed up with mapping creativity as part of this collaboration i created forge to help promote the event online  the model itself is based on the huge forges located in sheffield turning an iconic sight into a character by using molten magma as its legs    
heres a recent concept piece i made i dont get to work on many cars so this was a lot of fun
  this looks different from your usual stuff maybe cause its just a concept i would really like to see the template
  ill dig up the template for you it used some cool accordion folds to keep the model as few parts as possible so you fold the template together once to make a standard toy template and then again to build the car
im going to be live streaming for the next 45 hours creating a paper toy using licences space images feel free to join me      
  the stream is over for today we made some great progress on some space themed paper toys well be finishing the project tomorrow on a second stream from 9304 uk time
  i wish i wouldve seen this earlier was up all night installing a ssd for my wife i could have been watching this instead of listening to the clock tick away my life in the dark quiet
i just revealed this months supporter exclusive inspired by heman and tmnt the mutoids are slimy army builder villains all three will be released for supporters at the end of the month
new video  speed art desgin  space shuttle    this video features footage from a recent live stream sped up to show the design process of a simple space shuttle toy the model uses licenced illustrations converting them into paper craft nets    
    i made a new video taking on the creative market challenge designing an improvised paper toy check it out to see the whole design process from start to finish
  heres the end product the neon reaper its available for early access now and will be up for free download in two weeks time     
latest episode of lets design      i made an action to generate little germ colonies that i later used to make the paper crafts texture
  ive also been experimenting with some speed art videos on my second channel where i condense the design footage into a couple of minutes the result is interesting but i dont think its very informative     
heres a review of a rnli lifeboat papercraft kit i picked up recently     i was pleasantly supersized with the result the package didnt have a photo on it so i was expecting the worse but it turned out to be pretty great
  long time no see you need to make with the posting of videos and paper toys and videos and stuff again
hey ive been busy cooking up some paper toy halloween decorations including a hanging skeleton and a zombie head     you can download the here  folduptoyscom and watch the design process here  
  ive added a halloween section to the front of the fold up toys which ill be adding to over the next few days
  there arent enough diapers to hold all this baby shit wheres the cool stuff
  wheres the cool stuff  paper craft cool stuff pick one only
  well im mostly partial to origami but i noticed this  while surfing the board and it looked ridiculous childish so i ask again wheres the cool badass looking paper craft i dont see any here
  i was pleasantly supersized with the result    so you are served with fries and a drink
  no he switched out the drink for a vanilla shake only 60 more        doesnt contribute nothing but piss and moans you dont like dont make it you want to see something cool you make it   you wont only make piss and moans
  again i dont see any good or descent paper craft in this thread where is all the cool and good stuff  this all looks like a child made them with lines everywhere and you sir if you like this garbage then you are an idiot or something  basically here is some more pissing and moaning but that doesnt change the fact that this stuff in this thread is all garbage
  should i change the chamber pot mlord its quite apparent that yours runneth over  perchance your mother could allow you her nipple to suckle mayhaps this would calm the crying child  tis a shame her bosoms ran dry the day you were born really tis a shame
  really alex going under an assumed name anon your whit really amuses me you are  one funny guy or girl havent really figured that one out yet but seriously your paper craft really sucks
  sorry not sorry but this isnt alex alex has the sense not to indulge the rabble i on the other hand am sensless and you you are what the french call les incompétent
  i on the other hand am sensless  yep you nailed it
  yes i did i also nailed wait for it
  oh let me guess your mother
  no no no not my mother your mother  boom baby  why would i say my mother idiot
  no u
  well because youre senseless remember you dumbass oh by the way that was a shitty comeback seeing how you stepped into that one in the first place
        contribute something better so that i can learn and improve or stop moaning i like making simple and easy to build models that kids can make and i like to leave the fold lines thick visible    i just came back here to make another request thread and saw the two of you going back and forth dont take the bait people i dont need you to defend my designs or ability no one wants to see this tired thread getting shoved to the top of this slow board just to read people squabbling over little to nothing     heres a picture of a skeleton decoration i made for halloween to symbolize what this thread should be dead
  what this thread should be dead  if you want your threads to be dead then why the hell do you even start them in the first place  just run your little website and stay the hell out of here then
  do you ever stop and think that some people might hve an opinion different from yours take that attitude to tumblr   your opinion is shit anyway just my opinion doesnt mean shit either see thats how it works
  its all one samefag just ignore the twat
  my better nature tends to agree but damned if it doesnt get under my skin ill take your advice and sit it out from now on and post when i have something better to contribute
      screw you alex or alexa whatever your name or gender is stop defending yourself with alias

hey guys so i was organizing my paper collection earlier but then noticed i had a preference of placing the black ones at the bottom is that normal i also place the whites at the top but cover them with reds so the reds get dust instead    i really should separate them with one another especially the blacks what do you think
  i dump em all in a shoebox
  /thread
  is this a /pol/ thread i feel like this could be a /pol/ thread     i make tissue foil in 17x17 inch squares and break it down into increments of four then break one of the smaller cuts the same way i sort my paper by whatever order i originally cut them in larger papers in a folder smaller papers in a wood box lid l have
  i make tissue foil in 17x17 inch squares and break it down into increments of four then break one of the smaller cuts the same way  literally why is it autism
  haha nah dude i just like different sized paper particularly smaller ones that suit my designs better and its easier to quarter paper than by ninths or some shit    also thats just how i try to keep it in reality most of the paper is now scattered around the house or thrown into a drawer somewhere
  i mostly separate the papers of color from the whites then i further separate the blacks from the others this somehow prevents color mixing i would segregate all the colors if i could
i want to do some papercraft stuff but all i have is printing paper and notebook and some pencils are there any cool things i can make im thinking something touhou
bump
  why the fuck did you bump this 2 hours after its creation and then never again we have a thread up that was made in fucking 2016 bumping once a week is fine
  bumping on /po/
  bump
  printing paper wont hold up usual papercraft but you can try printing it halfsize if its something with large features
  ok
you can do some origami i made this today
      printing papers can hold themself in case of bw     from what op suggested there are paper child and dressing doll a cool origami is too op for printing paper to handle
  is that a chromebook looks good
a number of the models here with smaller pieces will hold up well on normal paper but im not sure what kind of paper you have there in your pic  
bump for interest
one minute im settling on the pool bottom and the sky is wavy light blue through eight feet of water above my head the world is silent except for the heartbeat in my ears my yellowstriped swim trunks are looped around my neck for safe keeping just in case a friend a neighbor anybody shows up to ask why i skipped football practice the steady suck of the pool inlet hole is lapping at me and im grinding my skinny white ass around on that feeling    one minute ive got enough air and my dicks in my hand my folks are gone at their work and my sisters got ballet nobodys supposed to be home for hours

post origami you folded  preferably one square no cuts

my rhino folded from 1 sheet of square paper not cut
  if possible can you share diagram
spider
if you want to see more or contact with me you can follow me on ig and if can plz u help me more follow thanks
this is a dimetrodon from a bird base    the other thread is super complex its as different from this as modular origami     in a totally different way i highly respect super comolex i look down on modular
  i dont like saying this but it looks awful that model would make a passable dragon though if the two flaps at the top wouldnt be joined
  i dont think its that awfull but the execution is bad and the proportions are way off
my griffin it was developed from bird base
  okay this is epi this is seriously amazing is it just a simple bird base nothing grafted on it it looks great
apatasaurus from a bird base
tyranosaurus rex  from a bird base
pteranodon from a bird base
      you must be from china since you cant manage to post your images upright
  yesonly bird base and no add anything  my dragon bird base
  theyre seriously cool designing from simple unaltered bases has mostly stopped in the 60s and i thought all their potential was exhausted but it seems i was wrong also the paper looks nice
          these are nice have you made any instructions for them
    beautiful
these are exceptional op         the traditional bases have almost limitless potential most of my designs have one as a base mainly because im lazy and dont want to make a custom base
  still waiting on a few of your designs to be diagrammed when are you going to make your book or booklet
    a bird base has four flaps five if you count the short one how did you get nine lengthy flaps out of it
      actually you can also pull out more than thatthanks if u want to see more you can follow me on ig kha_bop  i will draw cp it also diagram in the future
  you can also pull out more than that  thatd be called a frog base buddy
  not frog base i folded it from bird base
  mentioned in previous posts my pc shit the bed and am a bit strapped for cash will resume diagrams when im not limited to my mobile
  lovely rhino dude
  moose is that you   lovely griffin man
  no bro i am vietnamese
sup /po/ whats the smallest thing you ever folded    i just folded this about 3 min ago
  what you folded this on january 12 2018  you mean 12/1/18 this is the us dude  nice teeny tiny crane though
  this is the us dude  obviously not thats a euro coin and this is a northkorean sewing forum
feel free to post your collections your works in progress or your star hordes you can find lots of inspiration in the old thread  remember /po/ is a slow board so please dont bump the thread i created the last thread over two years ago heres to two more
  feel free to repost your favorite creations from past threads three years ago this was one of the images that inspired me to start folding
tfw too dumb to make paper stars    i tried but they never turn out okay what kind of paper gsm do you guys use for the strips
i have a paper shredder that cuts about the right length i run my supermarkets weekly deals magazine through it its the standard glossy catalog paper fairly stiff gives you good color variety and they hold up well i used to use notebook paper when i was in highschool ive also used receipts for one project
  long live the paper stars general     lucky stars tuto  pic related    very important  when wraping the long strip around the pentagon do not crease strongly soft creases will help a lot when puffing out the little star
  hm guess ill try again with glossy paper ive got paper strips which are originally for weaving but they are pretty thin and dont work well tried with regular copy paper as well and it wasnt much better despite some tutorial claiming its good for stars
how do you make the star puff out on both sides whenever i try to pinch the edges in one of the faces always end up inverted
  it really works with any kind of paper i like the usual 75/80 g/m2 i wouldnt use more than 100 g/m2 0 wrapping paper is also nice just use a longer strip if the papper is thiner
  take regular copy paper  1cm 04in wide stripe  fold tightly  it helps a lot when you have longer nails  stick middle of the sides with your nails making kind of marks only then press to the center slowly  however it inverting one face still happens sometimes just try to feel the right amount of pressure
  i made my gf 731 for our 2 year anniversary  one for every day wed been together each one with a lice note on the inside not sure if that is a lot or just a small number compared to you guys
id be more than happy to take star paper requests if anyones interested
  when wraping the long strip around the pentagon do not crease strongly  i just saw that its opposite of what i wrote    but i dont feel the difference still maybe for begginers its easier to make them more loose
        nice
  how does this work do you start with the white end
im new to this how exactly do you make these paper stars
  see    and have fun 
  did i do it right
  seems like it just a bit rough around the edges keep making them
started doing stars yesterday and i did quite i few of them but they are different size even though i use same sized stripe evertime any tip to do it more consistently
  theyre easiest with about 1cm wide strips yours is a little too big to get perfect angles easily
made a tiny vial of white ones with two red ones for my boyfriend for christmas i wanted to give them to him the first time we met up irl but i never got around to getting plain red paper theyre different sizes on purpose to represent the different people in the world the two red ones have notes in them white ones are kind of shitty because i used thick sketch paper and had to cut the strips with scissors     you guys usually cut out stuff like  with an xacto knife right
  i have a paper shredder that cuts about the right length  what brand ive been looking for a paper shredder that cuts in a workable width but all of the ones ive found were too thin
  yep it saves on printer ink to only have a halfdesign on it since you wont see the inner white parts    typically its easiest to use something like a widespaced paper shredder or a guillotine style cutter failing that xacto knives are pretty cheap and accurate if you still have troubles with wonky edges after using those try measuring the strips out on both sides with a ruler and connecting the line between them to make an easier to follow guide
hello there here are my stars from few years ago  guess i have some printed paper for another jar xd
  very beautiful collection you have there the ones on the right are my favorites    heres my jar of glowinthedarks i tried to get a picture of them really in action but my camera couldnt pick up their light properly
  that same image inspired me to start folding as well op     feelsgoodman
    praise these dubs
the struggle is real    get paper  get jar  use up paper  get more paper to fill the jar  be stuck with leftover paper  buy new jar  use up paper  more space left in the jar  circle continues  be left with hurting fingers and more stars than you know what to do with
how long does it take you to make one
  40 seconds
  more like 10 minutes you stupid paper wrangler
  being rude on one of the most comfy boards  being tripfag    ok 40 seconds speed folding 5060 sec without a rush
real talk if it takes you more than 30 seconds to fold a paper star you need to fold more paper stars    i bet you still have to look at the strip of paper while you fold too
/po/ anons are saying mean things about my country in /int/ please come say something nice about my home country and how it is one of the best in the world thanks faggots    
i wanna make these so bad but the idea of doing so intimidates me
kiwis with kiwi green stars
been a while since i made anything for anyone theres a cheeky message under the lid if the recipient ever thinks to open it i specifically told them not to otherwise it would ruin the arrangement
    this is fantastic great work anon
  what could you possibly mean by this
here is my 5 gallon fish tank i have also filled vases and wine bottles with these guys i can share more if anyone is interested
  better picture
what does /po/ thinks of my 7 pointed star     unfortunately you cant puff a 7 pointed star as much as a 5 pointed star
  seems very nice mind posting the vases/bottles
      incase you guys were wondering what the hell this is
  do you have this in a higher resolution
  how do
  when doing a normal lucky star you make a loop and pass the paper strip one time inside the loop to make a 7 pointed star you have to passe the paper strip in the loop 2 times in a certain way     ill try to post a photo when im home
question how do you get your strips of paper do you just cut every single one out with a knife or a pair of scissors or do you put the paper through one of those shredding machines for destroying paperwork
  here i made a photo i hope its clear enough i think 7 pointed star are fun to make once or twice but 5 pointed stars are definitely the best      i dont make a lot of origami stars so i cut the strips with an scalpel all by myself i bought a pack of strips of paper initially intendend for quilling and wanted to sue them to make lucky stars but the strips are too thin to make good lucky stars the same goes with paper shredder i guess you want something like 1cm large strips to make good lucky stars but paper shreeder usually make way thinner strips than that
  by the way if that wasnt clear enough    1 passes under 3 and 4 and it becomes 2  2 passes under 1 but over 4 and it becomes 3  3 passes over 4 and 1 but under 2   4 passes over 1 but under 2 and 3
anyone ever make lucky stars with the straws
  how long is it meant to be i took a 1cm row from the a4 sheet of paper but some times it seems like it was too long then other times in too short this is very confusing
  its okay i found out
    ty /po/ i have this nice skull now
  i love this gg
  looks dope
how do i get good at making these
  practice
  such craftsmanship
hi /v/ hope you guys have fun on our board ill make some paper star patterns i hope youll like

    im the one who posted  fifty years ago i just used a glass milk bottle think mine was heavy cream actually im fairly certain whomever has the cool skull container used an empty bottle of dan aykroyds crystal skull vodka    personally i just like to repurpose whatever i have lying around although theres gotta be a bunch of places online where you can get good jars for cheap mason jars are always in style
what am i screwing up
  nothing squeeze more evenly and pinch more deeply
  thanks
  how  i love the spiral in the middle
  thanks for answering what a shame i dont drink vodka nor milk
  thats one way to do it      no problems i dont drink vodka myself but ive considered getting it just for the bottle
  do any of you star friends happen to know of a similar small and simple design that is closer to a moon like pic related  the most of the ones that i found on google are too intricate and the only simple ones that show up look too ugly    i want the class of the paper star but in moon form
how do i make these well i always seem to fuck it up
how do i make these
  having slightly longer nails helps    
  put in some effort
ill have to take pictures of all the bottles ive filled with these i still need to get an empty patron bottle
  oh these looks cool ill probably copy it
  go for it my favorite thing is to fill bottles and jars with stars the color of what they originally had salsa jars are fun gifts
  might have to do something like this
      you can get a lot of cool glass jars and containers at thrift shops or just ask your neighbors if they have any empty bottles you could have
  i do these while operating heavy machinery

hi does anyone have instructions for this crane man i want to make a bunch and pose them  thanks
  its diagram is in the beauty of origami
bump i need to make this
  with small modifications 
  homo  lol
wtf is happening from step 11 to 12
  i think you have to repeat step 8910 on the other side i hate those fucking diagrams without words how long is it to ad 810 beside the fucking arrow 
  figured it out thanks a ton ill post a picture when im finished
  waiting for it     ill also post the diagram of the human crane in beauty of origami this evening if i have time
  i need to use a bigger sheet of paper
this has to be the most deceptively hard thing ive seen mostly because of those confusing diagrams
  how did you do that i cant understand
9x9 paper seems to be a decent size for this first go at it
step 31 can eat my ass but step 33 didnt make sense because you can fold them up at that area but a good bit lower oh well i made mine with 18x18 and made hang to string lights with claw hands
wow im glad it rotated the image all fucky like that cool
  im confused about 8910 seems the model wont lie flat but im not getting where to put the paper does the point need to be folded behind the rest of the model and its not done on both sides
  クレーンじら
  ジラ
u fukin wot m8
  i tried to make something like the monster from the ritual
  idk what the fuck is happening there
adapted mine to be a little creepier and crawling on arms and legs
hes praying the dude who made the diagrams suffers a little extra in hell
  he looks retarded
  thanks senpai
good luck making this shit looks like a mantis
  looking at the other images it seems i still fucked it up these instructions are something else
  american education  lol
anyone know what i would have to look for to make this
    the worst i have ever encountered are the origami instructions in rupert the bear annuals  it would take a while to find the worst of them as i pretty much every annual ever published
  share them
  what in the fuck
so i have had a quick look though the books published between 1945 and 1980  1200 dpi gets file sizes of 16 mb  doing 150 dpi with 15 compression runs about 330 kb per 160 x 230 mm  my scanner is only a4 so i have to scan each page then stitch two pictures together so add another 20 compression  the quality seems ok but trying to line up the pages takes time  it would almost be useful to have a web cam inside the scanner
from 44 books i got 36 scans of around 100 pages  still have not found the ones im looking for
i will post the animals first
thanks for all these more please
  thanku i hope at least some of this sees use  i get the feeling that most of these patterns are out of circulation and forgotten    there are a few that are almost too lame to upload  i will have a look though some more of the books  they have other paper craft projects that dont involve less folding
  thanks ill take all these you can find they are perfect for teaching youngsters how to fold
  plane  i had no idea anyone ever wrote this that way
  the instructions are clear and understandable but i dont know they seem autistic  like the idea gets across but theres no language to make it easier to understand at a glance despite trying to weave the dialogue around a story  its all technical instructions that assumes the reader understands whats going on entirely already with the folding i imagine this may be hard for many people of all ages
  autistic people are stupid so these instructions and diagrams could not have been made by an autistic person you people should really stop using autistic in your posts since you dont know what you are talking about in the fist place
  theyre not stupid they just learn and act differently its primarily a social disorder  i meant it genuinely not memetically no joke  i have an autistic little brother these are the exact sort of mechanical/technical instructions without any flowery language about how things look that he finds much easier to understand
  autistic people are stupid  anon youre the one who doesnt know what youre talking about
  the surprising difficulty of this guy adds to his powerful aura
  
  try this book    
  horrible instructions tease me until step nine then origami magic to step ten
tanteidan convention 24 pls anyone here 
i couldnt decide whether this is better for the planes thread or this creepy leg creature thread but heres ashikun he was pretty popular a few years back
also 10 legged crane was a thing
    this is what i think its trying to show 810 ive opened it up a bit and i havent tried to do the over side yet so who knows
  i have no idea how i got from 10 to 12 but im here i think
  im aborting this i cant get from 24 to 25 i thought the missing white side was a patterning accident but i think i fucked up bad somewhere between 8 and 12
  turns out i didnt missed read 16 ive got this
fuck this i must have gone wrong somewhere between 8 and 12
theres a model by shinji sasade which may or may not be closer to the one in the pic 
  being europoor  britbong  russian  nigger  canadian  mexican  american  jewish  iranian
this is amazin
  can you tell me what step 1617 means how does the white part turn colored
  for step 16 you take the edge of the paper on the other side of that single white flap and turn it over to the front so that the colored side will be in front a bit like an outside reverse fold but harder
  thats funny i think i made the same mistake as you  maybe ill try it again later
    please tell me theres a diagram for this
to commemorate spyros 20th anniversary im opening a blog dedicated to spyro papercrafts that ill be posting over time the first one is spyro himself feel free to edit the template if you need to    
  cute are these your own creations
this is perfection
      thanks yes i made them myself using the original ps1 models i just released this one
  man i miss how old spyro looked hate the redesign
    all the polygons
    this is absolutely amazing
  thank you for starting something like this spyro was may favorite franchise as a kid and ever since the ps2 era its left a sour taste in my mouth i might use this as motivation to start converting models into papercraft what particular programs do you use do you just import and deconstruct in pepkura designer or something else
/po/ stuff often manages to impress me everyone should visit that forgotten little pocket of 4chan if you never have before
  meant to visit /pol/ but clicked /po/ by mistake and im unironically glad i did printing this with the last of my color ink    does anyone know of a good place to get a crash bandicoot printout in the same ps1 style
posting the pdf in this thread so everyone can access it straighforwardly
  lineless version again for access and the sake of posterity many threads on here end up outliving its links if you want the pepakura file too though follow the links otherwise    and hope op doesnt mind instructions  1 build the horns parts 16 and set them aside  2 build the eyebrows parts 810 and set them aside  3 build the eyes and the eyes support parts 1114 and set them aside  4 cut out the crest parts 15  16 and set the pieces aside do not glue them together yet  5 for part 17 valley fold the tabs marked with an asterisk then glue the unmarked tabs under them   6 glue both crest pieces parts 15  16 to the marked tabs of part 17  7 finish the head by adding parts 1824  8 glue the previously built horns eyes and eyebrows to the head  9 build parts 2532 to create the front part of the body  10 build the wings parts 3338 using the same method as part 17 valley folding the marked tabs and gluing the unmarked ones under them  11 glue the wing membranes parts 3942 to the marked tabs of parts 3338 dont forget to cut out the extra  12 attach the finished pair of wings to part 26 and then add part 43  13 build the tail parts 4449  14 build part 50  51 and attach the front part of the body and the tail to them using the leg holes to glue those hard to reach tabs  15 add the remaining parts 5255 and close the model at one of the feet
  use the big head mode on reignited looks more like og
    
hey po/ do you know where i can find the last version of pepakura designer 318 full with the patch to view locked models thanks a lot for your help
  i have no idea i just paid for it and receive the updates
  thanks for a really useful post
here you go op im too lazy to write a proper patch so youll have to apply it manually    00021df4 0f95c3  32db90  0009568a 01  00  000977b0 894108  909090    using a hex editor navigate to the address before the colon youll find the value before the arrow there change it to the value after the arrow then save
  00021df4  i cant seem to find any of those addresses does it work for the 318 version
  install hex editor software  use that softwares search function find those number and replay them  then do
  i tried with notepad with the hex editor plugin should i use another
  hxd is decent and free
  ive followed your advise that address does not exist maybe they changed it in the new version
  the patch is version specific so the addresses definitely exist youre trying to edit pepakura3exe correct make sure you arent trying to open it via a shortcut as hxd will happily open the shortcut file itself rather than the program it links to    in hxd hit ctrlg to bring up the goto dialog make sure its set to hex and put in the address without the colon it should take you there
  dunno if the given numbers really exist already tried several 318 exefiles and none of them had those digits anyway i now have a quite good version however i cannot save as registration codes missing all the keygen no did not work if there is a still valid one please send to paperpastesafetypostde thanks
  me too cant find that code
  try this 088490455347
  thanks but the code did not fix the problem so i tried to find the digits in hxd again what eventually solved the problem at least for me this worked fine    00021ef0 0f95c3  32db90  00095850 01  00  00097740 894108  909090
   here i just noticed the download on tamasofts website says ver 318a this is the version i made the patch for perhaps 318 without the a is what you have installed that would explain why the offsets i provided didnt work for you
535895  thats it thank you but thus we now also have the digits for 318
hxd will not let me change codes    any help please
hi po/ do you know where i can find the patch to view locked models    thank u for help me
  here you go      manual patching instructions as usual if you dont trust my program  000127b3 894108  909090  00028f8a 0f95c3  32db90  0009c99a 01  00  0009ea50 894108  909090  using a hex editor navigate to the offset before the colon youll find the values before the arrow there change them to the values after the arrow and save    for anyone who cares something interesting i discovered while debugging the code path for the new pdo format  pdo files contain a byte that tells pepakura whether its locked or not in previous versions it would validate this value against a salted hash of the password to make sure you hadnt tried to tamper with the file and unlock it manually with the upgraded pdo format theyve introduced in 40 the hash check is completely missing so you can just open any locked pdo made with pepakura 40 in a hex editor change the byte at 0x44 to 0 and have pepakura open it without complaint
thanks for the help
according to changelog they also made this version highresolution
  ah so this is what they mean by robustness of locked files is strengthened
  i know im a moron or idiot perfect but im new with this handle hex editors and i hope someone is kind enough forum to explain to me how can i install the code you shared us it would be for me a great help and value     by the way i use the hex editor v611 neo serves this editor to modify the pepakura designer 40 with the code that youre not sharing    thank you very much for your help attention and patience
  you dont need to touch the manual patching instructions unless you want to the automatic patcher accomplishes the exact same task just put it in your pepakura 4 install directory with pepakura4exe and run it      yeah must have been an oversight on their part
    thanks for your answer and excuse me again but with this it says at the end of their posting and their patch     also apply the patch or what has to be done on their part with hex editors    i mean this paragraph    for anyone who cares i discovered something interesting while debugging the code path for the new pdo format  pdo byte files contain that tells pepakura whether its locked or not in previous versions it would validate esta value against a hash of the password salted to make sure you had not tried to tamper with the file and unlock it manually with the upgraded pdo format theyve introduced in 40 the hash check is completely missing so you can just open any locked pdo made with pepakura 40 in a hex editor change the byte at 0x44 to 0 and pepakura have open it without complaint     thank you for your patience / understanding attention and help
    you dont have to worry about that bit its just some technical info i thought people might find interesting the patcher program handles everything no additional effort required on your part
  thank you indeed for your time and patience    also for sharing this cool patch personally do not use it to sabotage to designers or artists trying to steal his works perhaps just changing the size of them or remove / put the lines    greetings and thank you again
  seems like they fucked up support for some version 3 pdos too  i get failed to open on a bunch my old files confirmed its not a problem with your patch happens with the original exe too
thank you
401 is out so heres a new patch      manual patching instructions  00012623 894108  909090  00028e8a 0f95c3  30db90  0009c71a 01  00  0009e800 894108  909090      sounds like they fixed this from the patch notes the reduced robustness of locked files is still present though bizarrely
  the reduced robustness of locked files is still present though bizarrely  is is still byte 0x44 because i tried and couldnt reproduce that    i was just doing it out of curiosity your patch works fine thanks
  oh sorry about that it turned out the offset varies from file to file look for a 0x02 byte probably with a 0x00 byte on either side within the first 0x50 bytes of the pdo thats the one you want to zero out you might have to do a bit of trial and error if theres more than one byte that fits that description shouldnt be more than 2 or 3 though    i should also clarify this only applies to the new pdo format that v400 produces pdos created with pepakura 2 or 3 dont have this problem
  it worked  thats really cool
  thank you    now i can change this 
to this
new version new patch      manual patching instructions  000135c3 894108  909090  0002a40a 0f95c3  30db90  0009cd2a 01  00  0009ee50 894108  909090    enjoy
  fast like ligthing   thanks again for your work
  thanks anon
  cool thank you 
  any hope for ver402 and beyond    update history  ver400  file format of pdo was changed robustness of locked files is strengthened
  the link in the post you replied to is for 402

hi   what about patch for 403
  there you go    00014613 894108  909090  0002ba5a 0f95c3  30db90  0009e64a 01  00  000a0740 894108  909090
  hi i was unable to locate the these in the pepakura4exe  i have v403 installed    its my first time using a hex editor i may be looking in the wrong place    btw i am not the same as   he could have asked a little nicer
  oh i just noticed that  just copied the patch from      is the patch for the 402 version not for the 403
  if you look closer youll see that the patch part looks the same but the offsets the first part before the  are different    this  is mine and its for version 403 tested and working    to use the hex editor you need to go to ctrlg if using hxd type in the offset so in the first part of the patch for 403 it would be 14613 and hit enter  the cursor should go to the correct offset and you should see 89 41 08 which are the values unpatched you just need to change those 3 values to 90 90 90 according to the patch and then move on to the next part of the patch once all the 4 offsets are done you just save and it should be patched
  oh sorry my bad i was using ctr f instead of crl g    does this also unlock editing mode
  peppatch    thank you
  this patch is to unlock editing on locked or password protected pdo files
  anyone who can and be so kind to put it so    it is that i dont know well how to handle the hex editors thank you very much in advance
hi can you tell me where peppatch403 download the software the way they do not explain sorry for my english one google translator
    posts bartman  gets dubyas    nice
    not the based patchposter but here is the patched 403 exe i used his instructions for just replace your existing pepeakura4exe with it and it should work  
im late but happy birthday
  did yiu ever build the stocking model
congratulations this is one of the oldest threads i have ever seen
you rock it works thank you so much 
is the based patchposter still around  will someone be so kind to link me a functioning patch for 404
hi could you please give new instructions for hexeditors at least
just use 403 
se podria cambiar la version del programa por ejemplo si es v404 a v1000    you could change the program version for example if it is v404 to v1000
patch for pep 312 hd for oppening locked files hex tut would be enough
  saludos me refiero a cambiar la version del programa si es pepakura 3 ponerlo pepakura 8 por ejemplo        greetings i mean to change the version of the program if it is pepakura 3 put it pepakura 8 for example
  894108  909090  0f95c3  30db90  01  00  894108  909090    unfortunately this doesnt work anymore for 404  the values are there but changing them didnt patch it /
any news here for the 404 guys
kind of a stupid question but can papercraft patterns be adapted to cloth to make plushes sorry if its offtopic but it didnt seem worth it to make a whole thread
  you can but plush will not be soft it will be unnecesary seams and hard corners    cloth can bend in two dimension at time to make soft curves and papercraft patterns avoid do that cause paper cant do it so it make bad plushes    anyway a papercraft pattern can be a alpha version to start modifying and make a proper plush pattern
    here you go guys these offsets will work for 404 sorry it took 5 months havent been doing much papercraft lately    00014673 894108  909090  0002b9da 0f95c3  30db90  0009e68a 01  00  000a07a0 894108  909090
  looks like 405 is out now too heres the new offsets    14683 894108  909090  2b9da 0f95c3  30db90  9e67a 01  00  a0790 894108  909090
thanks guys
this is nice but i feel bad with pirating this maybe if i get some monies in the near future i can pay the license so i can show my support on the people who made this you guys should too if you got extra bucks this software is really nice
  the patch were discussing doesnt crack the program you still need a valid serial i dont see why youre going all moralfag theres like 1 post itt actually providing warez
the patch is only for lock file not for program the file was lock for creator that mean you cant edit the file like change size color etc
  official web page pepakuraru
  finally a true image of the bitch

  this is not /r stop embarrassing yourself         install pepakura 403 and copy paste this to your installed folder  
      im working on a new patcher which ill have ready soon  it uses a pattern search rather than fixed offsets so it should work with any existing or future version of pepakura 4 assuming tamasoft dont make any massive changes
hola a todos soy nuevo y lei todo no se nada de editor hexadecimal pero porfavor pueden crear un parche para pepakura designer 406b  porfavor

  thank you very much for the tutorial 
mahck can u share the executable file
     download the necessary files and the tutorial it is not difficult
wow what an ancient thread
heres the new version i promised sorry it took so long      as i said in my previous post it works off a pattern search now instead of fixed offsets so it should work automatically with every current and future version of pepakura 4 until tamasoft make major changes to the codebase    i rewrote it in c so you might need to install the latest redistributables    
  thanks as always anon had trouble with the hex editor as my copy would crash after editing the values but the patch ended up working great
  installing the old version was a good shortcut to getting it to work because im too dumb to get the most recent one working
  is  not working for you
    file could not be written  trying on pep 406b
  tried running the patch as admin
  honestly i have trouble doing simple things    funny though that i was after this  same model
i patch the pepakura software but i still cant edit pdo files in designer cause still requires a password no code like xxxxxxxxxxx but like xxxxx anyone can help me
hello everybody someone has the codes to patch the new version of pepakura designer 407
  see here    new patches for every version are no longer needed
i do not know why the problem with some butt the patch work great just fellow this personand it works keep up the good work you done great job thanks again
how about 407  open files with password  thanks

thanks
    im having the same problem i get the prompt that says saving/exporting is only available with a keycode did anyone else get the patch to work on 407
    nvm just realized that the   patch is for opening locked models
pepakura 407 2018 offsets    endereço 14af3  00014af0 coluna 03  89 41 08  90 90 90    endereço 2c3ea  0002c3e0 coluna 0a  0f 95 c3  30 db 90    endereço a002a  000a0020 coluna 0a  01  00    endereço a2180  000a2180 coluna 00  89 41 08  90 90 90
  the patcher linked here  already works with 407 and beyond fyi
i will continue publishing offsets every update
hello i cant believe this post is still here i posted it over 2 years ago thanks a lot you helped me so much with the information and the patchs  anyways here i found some key codes for version 407 i needed this because i wanted to export the unlocked model but it asked for key code  045062174032   048502494840   048447066424   040995965258   046890714934    i hope they work for you as it worked for me

  pepakura 407 2018 offsets  the info provided below does not give you a free illegal working copy of pepdes  what it does do is it allows you to eddit including resizing pdo files that have been password protected      why use offsets  because many people are finding that the patch requires files they cannot install without first uninstalling previously installed more up to date versions of ms visual c dll files  i searched for hours on ways to do this without risking my pc boiling over then followed this thread till i found the info i needed      download/install/run hxd hex editor    in pepakura designer 407    use cntrlg to go_to the given hex offsets    change the value after the colon to the value after the _    endereço 14af3  00014af0 coluna 03  89 41 08  90 90 90    endereço 2c3ea  0002c3e0 coluna 0a  0f 95 c3  30 db 90    endereço a002a  000a0020 coluna 0a  01  00    endereço a2180  000a2180 coluna 00  89 41 08  90 90 90    eg go_to 0014af0  scroll to colulm 3 and change the next three values 89 41 08 to 90 90 90  repeat for each set of offsets      this allows you to edit password protected files inside in pepakura designer 407    thanks to mahck for the offsets    ugs
amazing thread everyone
  patch requires files they cannot install without first uninstalling previously installed more up to date versions of ms visual c dll files  that shouldnt be the case could you elaborate
  tyty i just used 4934 successfully
  no sorry

  babbys first slow board
  what are you new or something
i somehow got a code somewhere and it worked will i get fucked if i update it
  just dont let it die
do you the patch for versao 411 2018   thanks
  tell me about it
this is a culturally important thread and must be kept alive
one day in the distant future ill look at this threadand wonder how shitty my life is  sup
  true its a time capsule    but what is this thread even about lol
version 411 code  083153038951    found on a sketchy chinese website but i tested it and it works    youre welcome
  guy wanted had a bootleg version of that application and wanted to apply updates to unlock new stuff in it anon gave him hex codes to change in the app code to unlock it it seems to have evolved into the same thing but for every update that followed this thread is a time capsule for all the ways that anon can deliver and can be a persistent aid over years look at this thread with pride for it is a testament to our better selves
new thread instance old thread is archived now  pik8 thanks for the recoloring awesome work
man im glad you reopened it i wasnt finished posting the models i am making for this
i have the other three armies for crossmire but i have to test build them before i post them i hope to have the bigu sakura white lotus superheavy completed real soon too i just felt it didnt have enough detail bits and started adding things i should have that up soon too that way jackcaos can include it on the drive and website
  thanks a lot
here ya go crossmire theblue falcon anti aircraft tank
blue falcon bikes
blue falcon transports
blue falcon tank
i was really hoping to get a third plane on here since the falcons are so heavy on air support but the stands take up too much space
the agile ii is the only one i still have to build up but i think it is too small for the scale i went too far so ill have to post it when i get it done right also the antiair tank can no longer aim its guns up and down because the parts were too fiddly in my opinion so i just glue them at about 45 degrees the turret still turns though
i couldnt fit the stand on this one so i made a page of stands
here are the flight stands
red hammer bikes
rocket truck no longer rotates but still raises and lowers
red hammer tank it should also be mentioned that the helicopter propeller is to be glued onto the body so it doesnt rotate either all this is to make them easier to build at this scale
transport truck
the peoples hammer is giving me trouble it was fiddly to build at full size and sizing it down makes it almost impossible to build i have to choose a pose for it that is both dynamic and balanced so it is easier to build and still looks cool ill probably post that one when i post the agile ii
also i havent test built the white lotus yet so youll have to wait for that one
  nice joband i can wait for the white lotusthank you
  its just that i like to test build them before posting so i can make sure i have them useable and shaped right without having to post corrected ones later
finished the test build on the blue falcon agile ii i got the right size here you go
the only thing i really changed about this model was in attaching the fuselage connectors to one of the halves they are supposed to connect it reduces the number of parts on the page and eliminates one step in assembly not a huge improvement i admit but anything that cuts down on assembly time and adds to simplicity at this scale is worth it i kept the turret movement because this model really doesnt have much else going for it otherwise next up is tackling that peoples hammer wish me luck    if you have suggestions as to the best pose im willing to hear you out im probably going to go with something pretty simple like one arm out to the side and the hammer over the head midswing
okay i feel stupid now i posted the wrong one the width of the wings is off on that other one this one is right sorry about the mixup
alright got the white lotus here is the plane i was able to get three on this page
anti aircraft
bikes
tank i could only get two of these you could always add some figures into that empty space so the paper isnt wasted
transports
and i finally have the bigu sakura landship ready i made up a datasheet but havent playtested it it may be under or over powered i tried to make it a fair ballance similar to the other superheavies here is the datasheet first
page 1
page 2 ive found that by building the main hull first then adding the bow and transom you square this up first then you put the control tower onto the deck from underneath so the tabs are folded out this gives structure and stiffness to the deck and then you glue the deck onto the hull starting from the back working forward if there is extra deck sticking out in front just trim it off i left plenty of extra grey and black to allow for that the flags can either be out on the two back corners on top of the deck or glue them to the outside of the back
page 3 i forgot to mention that the tabs for teh main hull walls that go across the inside of the hull are folded out so they dont interfere with the turret holes if you make that mistake simply trim the visible part of the glue tab away when you have the deck in place
and finally crossmires mini version this one fits on only one page though it doesnt include the data card
just a note on the mini version the gun barrels simply glue to the surface of the turrets i didnt include the parts to make them aim up and down because of lack of space and wanting to make it easier to build at the smaller scale
im still working on building the peoples hammer this thing is the definition of fiddly
  i dont know what this is but it looks neat
  thank you very much
  np now if i can just finish the other customs ill be golden
  it was fiddly in the original scale has this been reduced or kept the same to give it a more imposing relative size very cool model though good articulation was tempted to make alternate weapon/forearms for it
i shuffled the parts around a little bit so the drivers fit in now also thought it would be nice to have numbers on the turrets
  i made these smaller models because there was a need crossmire and i knew i could fill it i knew someone would rearrange the models so they could print what they wanted without wasting paper and im glad to see someone has you could also do this for the troops page to get only one faction printing an entire army of infantry on only a couple of pages is pretty sweet nice job
my gosh the peoples hammer is a tough one especially at the tiny size im still not done with it
  anyone knows what happened to mini dungeon adventures
i have it if you need
  im looking for the 40 with the count vludd stuff why is it so hard to find
ill try
and the fourth ed rules are too large a file size to post here sorry
  dude thank you very much  you are awesome
 just found the thread with all of the new mines they look grate thank you and i did one for you
hey /po/ im from /tg/    i was hoping that maybe you guys and gals could help me im looking for foamboard templates for buildings and the like for table top wargames    not so much paper craft as foam craft     ill post the 2 or 3 building templates ive found so far as examples
    things like these
  and stuff like this
  pattern for ops post
   i have a few paper terrain models laying around somewhere i can upload if i find them and if youre interested it would take some work to convert to foam board i imagine due to material thickness
  /po/ isnt /pol/  take the l and leave
  /po/  /pol/  hnnmmmmmmm 
  /pol/ is paper on lithium
bugbaits imperial bastion  keep in mind that there are a number of pieces with off sided measurements ex the top floor has 4 outcroppings that should be of similar measurement each but it can be clearly seen that this is not the case you even have mismatched angles on said outcroppings    use with caution
  more bugbait this time a fortress of retribution  again be wary of measurements
  itll be alright    thanks
i posted this awhile back and saw that the link was gone so here it is again plenty of paper models for fantasy wargaming

im gonna make a lamp shade for my bedroom im thinking of including red celophane to reduce the blue light any suggestions for cool patterns
bump but maybe you already picked a designed out
the website is to showcase some of my models as well as act as a free resource what should i add to the site to help fellow enthusiasts    what more should i add to the website and a general critique of how it looks and feels please ill be greatly appreciative    orikamiin
as for the look and feel i like it it stands out from the abundance of origami websites stuck in 2000 while not being too bloated the fact that a single sheet category exists is quite weird but i guess it makes sense i took a look at the models and your instagram and i really really like them what model is the one on the banner at the top of the page
  also you could specify the book where the model is taken from like robert lang does on his website or a link to the instructions if theyre available
works well on mobile it feels more like a portfolio site so i dont think you need to add more in terms of resources/patterns     the questionable photoshoping dont really do your designs justice though
    thank you for sharing what you thought of it one big reason i made it is because 90 of origami websites ive seen have really clunky and old interfaces i wanted to keep things simple but also elegant    thats an excellent idea ill look into doing that for the models
  im lad it works well on mobile while my heavy focus was on desktopit really shines there i know that most people would use it on their phones    while it has a showcase of models i made and i will keep updating it with things i fold i want it to have free resources and easy information for people who like the models they see    i thought about including a difficulty rating but that becomes quite subjective ive found    the questionable photoshoping dont really do your designs justice though    hahaha the dodgy photoshop is something i knew someone would pick out honestly after spending weeks on it i skimped a little over there
  those fucking tips  at least put in some effort if youre folding stuff that even the average housewife can do
  ill keep that in mind the next time i fold the model thank you for sharing your opinion
it doesnt even load for me so i mean at least the loading screen looks crisp asf
  its not all that impressive right now
its stuck at the pink loading square for me
you have an h floating around the mobile page hehe
everyone has a webpageeven if it was free you could try and have an original thought instead of following the sheeple who couldnt see a gap in a hedgerow
will be a page to just show models or will add the diagrams ir something
  simplicity and instructions in any formatwonko has a site that has photo tutorials and beginners like those
i really dont like the aesthetic the overuse of fades is probably the worst part origamime is a site with much better css minus its overuse of slide in and fade appearances of elements it has clearly divided sections a navigation bar thats clearly separated from the rest of the elements and very quick loading times    also your website really has no practical use which would be fine if it held up as a piece just showing off webdev ability but the design is too poor for that
a very ambitious tryuseless to have great number of views if the models are poor or the navigation clumsy  try to find out what models people want to fold or get stuck on  why do what others have done competently before you

  how do you do this make it with cardboard paper scissors and tape/glue
  go back
  not cardboard only a4 paper scissors  glue stick   here is another fun  old photo 3 yrs
is this good
  holy shit wheres the template
finished that ring from the weird ring thread fiddly little fucker    cant believe i was too slow to fold and bump a /po/ thread
  glad to know my efforts helped someone
    i want to die
    what is this shit anyway
  its called papercraft and its a shit hobby that should be excluded from /po/ god i hate it so much
  hahahaha where did you fuck up
  where did 4chan fuck up oh when they included papercraft in the subjects of this board must i really go to /r/origami for a pure and enjoyable origami community i want /po/ to split now
  /po/ is too big and too busy a board to support both papercraft and origami
  you know there are two letters in /po/ one of them the first one stands for papercraft
  chill out man
  ahahahahahahha
1star exercise by alessandro beber
dwarf be like eyooo ma nigga
finishing up death just shy of 3 foot tall its really well and i hope to make it more life size in the future
  i think it looks great heres a suggestion go over the areas where you glued it together with a light marker test the color on the same cardstock beforehand to see if it matches
  i think papercraft is cooler than origami change my mind
  bredy
  and a suggestion from me throw that in the trash an make an origami grim reaper
  you have to go back
  /po/ stands for perfect origami
  hes gnot a gnoblin and hes gnot a gnelf
hi /po/ ive recently gotten back into origami again for the past few years i havent been into it returning to the hobby i found an amazing model but couldnt find diagrams for it so i improvised the folds myself to come up with something similar its not finished yet its a modular piece but i wanted to show you guys maybe ill make a brief video on making the units as well if anyone is interested in the meantime what pieces have you created yourself pic attached is mine will post picture of the model that inspired me as well as a note on key differences
  pic is original made by lukasheva ekaterina and it is called the minotaur kusudama link is the gallery that i found it in anyone know how to make some of the other models here     
  as you can see my version has dual colored faces on the corners of the cube shape the symmetry that this model follows is the cuboctohedron which has squares the spiral faces and triangles the stellated triangular faces on the corners
  finished model slight warping at corners i need more space on the folds with alot of layers to avois that next time spiral pieces are six layers which is a lot for thos points
here are a few diagrams for you show off your results
  it seems you like jo nakashima can understand why his aesthetic is very nice
  yes i like his work i like yours too thats why im still waiting on diagrams of the ones i mentioned in the thread you started
  and i am working on them sorry im not the fastest at what i do
  oh you do good work just take your time i didnt say i was in a hurry i just said i was still waiting for whenever you get them done
do you have a dog diagram
  what kind of dog
anyone have akihiro kosuge whale 
only diagram when the model is good enough lots of people waste time on drawing diagrams for garbage models
  it never got released it was supposed to be in drawing origami tome 2 but for some reason it was left out
  for some reason it was left out  it was too close to kamiyas orca which might or might not be a valid reason
  granted they are both nice killer whale designs they look nothing alike although they appear to be similar here is a shot of each one first the akihiro kosuge design
  and now the satoshi kamiya design
  sorry if that came out i was tired and crotchety       well thats a very subjective thing     they are rather different and i prefer kosuges version
  i prefer kosuges version  i do too i wish he had released the diagrams
  simple  15 minutes  actually took me 1 hour and it was quite difficult
  these times and difficulty levels are more for experienced folders not beginners it doesnt matter how long it takes or how difficult it is as long as youre enjoying what youre doing
what is the most difficult diagrammed model 
  depends on what you want to call diagram also some models difficulty cannot be compared as they might be difficult for different reasons anyway there is this 350 step origami flying beetle by shuki kato and this 400 steps gigantausorus also by shuki kato they are both completely diagramed no cp or cp/diagram hybridand are the longest in terms of steps diagram that i know that should be a good start
    it took me 2 hours and i am not happy with how the arms doesnt even stick out of the body
  these times and difficulty levels are more for experienced folders not beginners it doesnt matter how long it takes or how difficult it is as long as youre enjoying what youre doing
  i meant that it took me twice as long as this guy 
will you do the insects at some point  i hate watching youtube tutorials /
  im a newfag and didnt understand step 29 so i didnt do it lmao
  looks like you skipped 28 as well or didnt properly do the step look up crimp folds step 29 looks like a simple mountain fold of either side inwards
  sorry if that seems rude on jo nakashimas video step 28 begins at 1000 if you want to see how he does it is done     also here is a video to show pleats and crimps      it says pleats and crimps look the same in diagrams which is true only if the author hasnt included arrows which nakashima has double zigzag arrows indicate a crimp no arrows with alternating valley mountain folds with or without a single zigzag indicate pleats    step 29 becomes simpler when step 28 is done properly it is simply folding into the cavity of the model
  not rude at all this being 4chan the fact that you managed to give advice without calling me an insufferable unlovable faggot who disappoints his father makes you a saint    i did do 28 but i must have botched it
  my fist complex piece after a few years not doing origami the smaller folds were really difficult and it took a me a long time to figure out how to do the head
  well i kinda got it never had to do a curve fold before and in general im pretty bad at 3d shaping stuff
  looks great very well done
  currently waiting on some nicer paper
  ber bottle  please this is a blue board
there is a new design by jo nakashima quite a cool phoenix but i cant be fucked to watch a 41 min video
  thats only 41 minutes origami isnt for you if you dont havethis kind of attention span
  love folding hate watching
  what i personally like doing is watching youtube tutorials for complex models on 2x speed it allows me to assess the complexity of the model and enjoy the interesting steps also i like to mentally scold the demonstrator for dumbing down various steps down to brainletlevel even in videos that an inexperienced folder would never watch tadashi mori is particularly guilty of this sometimes he will even say stuff like this is called a reverse fold while teaching some intricate dragon
  time to fold it 20 minutes  video is 12 minutes   hmmm
  first attempt really like this model gotta try it again now that i understand it with some better paper also thank you for your effort
anyone got a pdf of this
  does this look like a damn diagram
  cant believe i fucked up the wings
  whats up with these ridiculous dunce caps
snek
here are hundreds of origami diagrams for you    
  what if we organised all these models by day or in separate pages to make them easier to find  nah we can just put them all on the enormous main page with all the images and make them searchable by their spanish names  all those diagrams are great but how retarded is the creator of the website
here is my almost complete le penseur heres to making many more beloved sculpture 
  very nice
  is this like a base for a sculpture im kinda curious bth can you post a better photo it looks awesome
cant find this one
erm sorry guys i missclicked
cant some one help me find this model
does anyone still have any models from this site   i made a cute nano from nichijou back then but now that i look it up again all downloads are down pretty disappointing since i wanted to get sakura too from there
  youve probably found them by now but the wayback machine has a few zips saved these are the ones i was able to find            
  bump for this here
  dead site  i agree
  not op but thanks
niseke was a fad for a while
  thank you for these
join this site it has lots of charactersafter you earn credits download and get more accessoh a browser with plug ins and a translator is essential
how do i open pdo files ieerror while parsing the package but i could read the html file
  ladyferrari邀请您访问折纸学院  
im specifically looking for sakura nano and azusa but it seems that none of them are archived anywhere    i dont even know how the search engine would work with japanese names
op here  fukn foundem    im so happy
this is a crease pattern that i have no info aboutthe author of is a human figure and its symetrical along the diagonal axis thats all i know lets finish it together
568760  the problem with a lot of crease patterns is the draughtsman dont want to draw attention to themselves with giving too much free tutorage   on this example not only do we not know the subject as we look at itbut we have no direction regarding the limbs arms legsheadhairapr indress details boots  if you were to post a photograph of the model as we look at it
decrease the cost of sex
    if that was a guess to the subject your way off  this is a high maintenance anime character will post more when i locate file
  reminds me of the cp for a ryujin 35 head on simple crane cant seem to find the original cp
  i had a look at the ryujin and most of the orientations are nw and have folds similiar
op this is the model its supposed to bei believe its winry from full metal alchemist  the collapsed cp is not anywhere on the web  i have what looks like the elric brother body armor
if its not windy then its the maid from seven sins the storys are similar too with the body armor thing
winry
  the maid from seven sins  the what thats a sakuya from touhou
  in the first episode the girl who arrives at the inn with an armored suit and falls asleep on the bed 
    the picture you posted is a touhou shes a playable character on pcb th07
  a human figure that created a mysterious crease pattern sounds like an anime
  i just randomly came to this board and ive never done anything similar i can tel that your image is supposed to be a woman in a dress or a man if youre a queer am i autistic i have a measured iq of 155 so its possible
  you are correctnow that we have established the subject can we discuss how to collapse
i want to craft an advent calender in a squirrel theme and as gifts i want to have small acorn paper boxes one for each day but i cant find any nice templates  can somebody help me out here
ads getting smarter
  what do you mean by ads 
    perhaps ads for wintershit papercrafts
  what if i had just hoped somebody could help me instead of criticizing what i want to to with the template 
anyone here making their own tissuefoil with methylcellulose  what kind of tissue paper do you use/prefer and where do you get it from  any tips or tricks that might be useful  ive had a few successful attempts but the layers of tissue tend to separate upon turning a fold from valley to mountain and vice versa    thanks in advance
where did my other comment in this thread go the one about this finally being a good thread in this wasteland of a board
  you dont make tissue foil with mc you make double tissue with mc mc doesnt stick to foil which is probably why the papers separating    for tissue foil use elmers or white glue watered down or since you have mc and tissue paper already skip the step of trash tissue foil and just make far superior double tissue by mc  roll paper on  mc  roll paper on  mc  let dry
  you dont make tissue foil with mc you make double tissue with mc mc doesnt stick to foil which is probably why the papers separating    for tissue foil use elmers or white glue watered down or since you have mc and tissue paper already skip the step of trash tissue foil and just make far superior double tissue by mc  roll paper on  mc  roll paper on  mc  let dry    yeah i mixed up there a little bit im trying to make double tissue not tissue foil  it looks perfectly fine when i pull it off the glass but sometimes separates when folding  can you maybe recommend a brand of paper which works well for you  ive already tried adding more powder to the mc but it didnt make much difference so it might be the papers fault
  the mc should be the consistency of egg white if its too thick it wont absorb into the paper so it wont stick together properly so it could be that im in aus and grab a bulk pack from office works or some fancy shit from a news agent try a different brand i found different brands and even different colours from the same brand can behave way differently
as mentioned mc is not recommended for tissue foil but there ive heard of people using cmc carboxymethyl cellulose for that     i use the cheap canson and clairefontaine brand and it works well its easier if you buy some fancier tissue paper which doesnt tear when wet but its not necessary maybe the problem is that you dont use enough mc  what i do is that i glue the first sheet on my window by applying mc on ti with a paintbrush when the first layer is completely soaked i glue the second layer on the first in the same way i brush till the second layer is also completely soaked     ive never had any issue except for minor layer spearations on overworked corners which you can fix easily with glue
  i am sick to fucking almost death by this shit how come when ever i make it a thread about it this no one responds and all i get is more captchas are wrong all i want to know of if tinsel worked better with water based color on paint on papora google wont eeven give me right results on forums on its topic seriously why have none of hou thought of this yet all im saying is that dice folds are more complicated than deciding what type of paper is best used for box making treats youd think that a simple yes please will get the job done here on
  you alright dude
someone has the book paper  form  origami for experienced folders  zsebe józsef
  that statement is probably correct
  i concur
  i dont think so
who
  need this please
  i think i might have it
  really can ypu post here
showem bois
what is this
currently unfolding the entire dangerous zombie armor from a gamerip someone put online  its fucking me without lube but its gonna be so fucking worth it
  share it wont you
do you ever give away your paper creations do people appreciate them tell some stories itt
  give away some of my own designs get mixed reviews number one thing ive noticed is people dont find it anymore impressive that i designed them myself probably assume all of us are creators and not just folders     a lot of my female friends decorated their rooms with my models though since many of my designs are seathemed bitches love the sea
i give away probably 80 of what i fold if i didnt id run out of room people seem to put far more value into it than i do maybe because i can just make another one  i like to leave stuff at coffee shops i like the owners seem to like it and at some places other people will leave things as well i like to show up and see something new though i rarely get to meet the other folders
  of course its practically my entire motivation last christmas i spent an entire weekend constructing a super personal and pretty christmas card for an internet friend with a bunch of popup papercraft features and they loved it very much
  same here any models i make because im waiting like at the doctors office or waiting for an appointment etc i leave around sometimes i catch a kid discovering it and they get so excited other times older people will smile and take it or give it to a kid    other more involved models i give away to people who appreciate them if they ask me about it and seem to appreciate it ill give it to them     some people just dont care about them though i made a rose once at the hospital while waiting to see my father after his surgery and put it on a window sill thinking maybe it could lift someones spirits it came out really well a cleaning lady came by saw it picked it up and just crumpled it and threw it away in her eyes it was just scrap paper    so yeah gift away to people that are attracted to them sometimes i see them folding beginner stuff afterwards and its a good feeling
  do you ever give away your paper creations    no     do people appreciate them    fuck other people
  my tears have been jerked bro
  most of my motivation to make papercrafts is to give them away as presents the pic shows a couple examples    i made the dog for a birthday present for my girlfriend it ended up taking way more time than i expected but it turned out great she was really happy with it and has it displayed in her cubicle    i made the kusudama for my grandmother last christmas with a little note saying who its from her memory is going but i hope it reminds her of me
  give girlfriend origami for christmas  haha everyone ive dated has given me origami for christmas
  i got a bunch of free drinks at a bar for making origami dragons for a bunch of cougars
  thats beautiful anon im sure both your girlfriend and your grandmother loved them
  in a hospital she has to assume a sick person made it or whatever and toss it btw she wasnt giving an implied judgement of your paper
  maybe that means that youre the only one she has ever dated
  give cute girl in my school some origami as a random gift at the end of term  thanks anon why are you giving this to me  panicjpg  im giving everyone in the class origami  spend the next hour folding shit    yolo
  lol nice story
  thanks my nig
all these anons leaving their lil origami creations behind wherever they go  suddenly i feel less lonely  i should lurk this board more often start making something other than cranes for people to find
i gave this beast away to my 10th grade english teacher because shes like 62 and we affectionately teased her by referencing the incredible hulk    if youre reading this mrs bothwell we still love you    ks  mb
  hulk smash
  yeah dude i dont feel bad about it some people just dont notice or arent interested if they do thats alright
back in sophmore year i folded a pretty shitty rose and just left it on the table when the bell rang the next day it was pinned up on my teachers corkboard next to her desk
as a pass time i fold peterpaul forchers fox i usually end up giving it to someone and if not they end up on my shelf dozens of people have these by now some keep them on a shelf for decoration others lose them after a while  ive noticed that therere two types of responses  either they see it as a cool little trinket or a very personal gift either way i enjoy when people accept them  for something that takes 15 minutes to make it sometimes brings a lot of joy  pic related  my wee army of foxes
i usually make origamis at school i used to gift them to my closest classmates then i noticed they didnt really care about them because they think its just paper i can remember a lot of situations where id found the origami on the floor or they would just forget them somewhere  makes me kind of sad theres not too many people here that thinks origami is good or impressive
  ive become somewhat zen about my folding ill regularly fold something and then destroy it soon after much like the sand mandalas it is about the creation and journey origami leads you on not any end result so view those models on the floor as passing and move on
  thats nice anon personal gifts mean a great deal to many people no matter how small and simple    i like to fold things and leave them around my workplace for people to find
  she wanted your cock
  this i give away 99 of what i fold and everyone is blown away by even the simple things i worked at toys r us for a seasonal job     i had a nanager lucy gillette who was in her 50s but a hollywoodbeautiful euromilf think she was portuguese very strong work ethic yet she was beautiful and outgoing she found outi was making other coworkers origami and wanted something too i came in with a kawasaki rose one day for her game over this lady paused and lost her strong demeanor all the coworkers around us couldnt stop making comments when she was able to respond she said if you werent married i would kiss you she herself had a boyfriend who was her exhusband but her comment completely ignored him as a barrier to some side action    if i werent married i would have been with so many chicks in my life lol origami is the best pickup line
  u
this started as forgot but moved to gave away    brought a couple pieces of origami paper to work  when the store was slow i folded up a single crane   intended to bring it home for my thousand cranes  somehow left it at my register when i left  come back in the next afternoon  morning lady found it and stuck it on top of a pole behind the rewards screen  do you know who did this points to bird  that was me  comments on how cool it was which made me happy now i dont want to take it  crane is still hanging there maybe 23 weeks after first folding    also at work ive folded up a rudimentary penguin because of how many customers said it was freezing that one was gone the next day though
be in some kind of group about personal improvement and some other things  each one of us has to say something gay about what wed give to one another if we could  stuff like id give you wings because i know you love exploring the world  thats the level of gayness were talking about  its my turn i sperg out and end up saying id give you each an origami model for next time  next time i bring them each something  it was pretty nice there were also only about six or seven people so i didnt have too much to do for that i remember giving away dai watanabes little bird and jeremy shafers flasher and mini flasher hat among other things
i used know how to make a tyrannosaurus boys and a unicorn girls origami used to make them at work/school when bored and gave them to small children the way their faces lit up was golden
  yemen  on a coach from al mukalla to crater in aden  recovering from a fever still pretty sick   doing origami to distract myself from persistent urge to vomit  fold robert j langs scorpion from origami insects  their kin  takes over an hour  kid in adjacent seat watching the entire time  after i am finished he reaches out his hand and indicates that he want to examine the scorpion in greater detail  hand him the paper model  kid methodically unfolds it then hands back the creased square of paper  allahu akbar
  why did he do that just like i unfolded your model teehee or was he curious about how it was made
  i sensed no malice or spite in his actions maybe he was just curious or he thought the whole point was begin again
a ton of garbage papercraft threads on the top of the catalog  this one buried  there is no justice in this world
when i was in the third grade thats when i first started origami i made a swan for this one girl that sits across from me and that was it idk what happened after that
  sounds like a buddhist mindset actually like the monks that make sand mandala and then wipe them away
  oh youre back the origami part of the board was so soulless without you
  as a kid i did that i think with someones paper airplane i wanted to figure out how it was made as time went on i still end up doing that sort of shit peoplell hand me neat things and ill instantly want to take them apart
  im sorry you feel this way anon
  so far i give everything i make away i dont really need it for me being able to have folded it is enough maybe ill feel different once i get into complex models with quality paper but i dont think so im just not the type of guy to keep stuff as decorations around the house the people ive choosen seem to like it at least in a wow cool way thats more than ill get from keeping them
  it looks really nice where do i learn how to fold it
i used to make random shit to pass the time at work i ended up giving some away since people started to notice its funny how much people are amazed and seem to cherish these things even though i only made them because i was bored
  dont know if you found it already or not but i found it with just a quick search
    yup thats the one i think therere a couple of videos of it too though i doubt theyd helt much for the smaller folds takes 15 minutes or so 35 of them and you should have it memorised
  beautiful picture youre a nice guy      kek
  can i use normal a4 sheets or do i need colored cardboard
  normal a4 sheets are fine all the foxes on the shelf  are made from cheap dollarstore paper any paper will do cardboard will make it harder
  thank you
i went to the shinkai makoto exhibit when it rolled into the city in japan i was living in with this girl i bought the art book they had and 2 of their 1/100 5 cm/s i cant remember if i told her i was going to make it for her or if i just did it and telegrammed her photos but anyways i made it for and learned how to write her name in cyrillic so i could address it to her properly    i think she called it the nicest thing anyones ever done/given to her so that made me feel nice incidentally shes the only woman ive met so far who ive felt i could love
i had learned to fold all completely on my own when i first start high school in an attempt to make flowers to pic up chicks ended up never picking up chicks but instead went on to do a four year career of sorts with it working my way up to satoshi kamiya and robert j lang always gave away some portion of my stuff that i just made because i was bored and looking back now i probably could have picked up a few chicks with it i just find it weird that learning to fold entirely on my own i still ended up like all of you guys giving it away its weird
    based     youll have good karma 
someone from work put out origami paper and instruction sheets on the tables in the lunch room which made me pretty happy    ive been folding them during breaks and leaving them in the lunch room it would be nice if someone wanted to take them but i doubt anyone will without permission
hello alex here from fold up toys a little while ago i did a request thread on here taking suggestions and turning them into downloadable paper toys for a video series i had a lot of fun making the models you were interested in    ive just finished all my major projects for the year and wanted to try this again but this time work towards a larger overall goal putting all the toys based on the requests into a selfpublished book    ill still make the models available for free download but this way i can wrap the request project up in a neat little portfolio friendly bow     so tell me what youd like a paper toy of and if i like your suggestion ill make it the op image has some of the models i designed from the last thread as examples
do a variety of little houses so when you do things that are supposed to be big like a giant robot you can give them a sense of scale
  paper toy request thread lets make a book  yeah lets not
  a series of superheroes doesnt have to be copyright stuff maybe come up with some like paper fold guy or origami girl or /po/ troll
  i got it or queer guy or gay man
   op  i got it or queer guy or gay man    thats an intrresting idea do you ever think about using papertoys as a form of activism something to bring awareness to issues we face in our current state of society
  thats also a good idea make a bunch of queerguy and gayman paper models and hang them all over the country with strings in the form of nooses
  so childish and edgy
    pls please please dont politic my hobby
  please dontwe just want to make origamidont turn it into something full of hate
hey alex nice to see your request thread is back again been a little while  i know you have that other fut going  lets make a book  exciting do you have a general theme in mind for this book or is it really going to be whatever anons reasonably suggest any case we probably dont want to go overboard with franchisespecific characters and stuff if we want this project to age well    i like this suggestion
  so childish and edgy  good one i really got burned  sounds about like all the stuff created by this op
   you    whoa not sorry i asked glad i did i know other artists from other groups have tried in the past during the platform model boom but its nice to see that people want keep papercraft and origami pure
this    or      how about some super robots to go with the scenery or scenery to go with the super heroes something where by the end we can have a full scale diorama   think mini dungeon adventure only on a larger scale and not so blocky
  that could make a good cover actually a sort of cityscape diorama of the various scales of toys
      wow peeps youve really gotten into the spirit of things and run with these ideas what great suggestions i really like how these ideas build off of one another and its given me plenty to get started with ill be starting the design work on monday and will begin with some miniature buildings and use it as an excuse to talk about the techniques we can use to mathematically slice a cube up in interesting ways      i have no theme in mind im quite happy for the book to just be a jumble of random characters and concepts ive got enough larger bookstyle projects in the works that are following a single style or theme that the idea of a book full of random designs sounds quite fun because im not planning to pitch it to publishers and to just do a small print run we can do whatever we want franchise characters included
  do you live stream on twitch ig or other place i know you did a couple times before
  i sometimes stream on the main youtube channel but if no ones watching after the first hour or so i usually give up because i can get more work done if im blasting some music and not worrying about which camera needs to be used etc if you do manage to catch me whilst im streaming say hi i love to talk to people about design
  make some clothes to dress up your halloween skeleton with
request update 1    ive started work on some little buildings after designing a few myself and finding it a little tedious i decided to licence some artwork from talented darumo to use as textures here is the first preview honestly im enjoying working on these little buildings and skyscrapers so much i could probably fill a book full of just these
   i wouldnt mind having a little city i could build with roads and cars and little paper people and maybe run a thomas the tank through it and hang some paper toy air planes from fishing line and put them all on a motor and when i get tired of living in this big pointless world i can sneak away to my little paper city and know that everything is going to be okay    looking forward to this
request update 2    these little buildings are a real treat to work on ive finished 8 so far along with some little extra detail elements i was originally planning to juts make one toy per request but as usual ive run away with the project   heres my idea so far taking the requests from this thread into consideration a simple a5 book filled with little buildings some of which are half destroyed the book would also include two giant kaiju inspired monsters fighting in the middle of the city the book would come with everything you need to make a distressed cityscape     i have some old concept art for a buildable kit called kaiju  collateral damage somewhere ill see if i can dig it up and use it for this concept   thoughts
  sometimes its nice to work on something simple and easy these look good and fun   the monsters are a good idea but you could fulfill 2 request by throwing in a super robot something in the classic anime style like gaiking or mazinger not pacific rim realistic type
would love to see a heavy gear or armored core mecha papercraft
can someone share chen xiaos housemaid diagram
  here
  thank you
i have 100 gigabytes of paid papercraft models where can i sell my collection

  we dont need this jackass to prove anything  we just need this asshole to stay the hell out of here
  where can i sell my collection  i might buy some at a discount of 5  10 but you have to proof you have the right to sell them
  give them for free
      op here i can record a video of the folders and files and send it to you contact me on telegram this is my handle on telegram    vortextech
  i can record a video of the folders and files  why dont you post the video here  then everyone can see it

  the idiot that started this thread
  ok jew i pay u 1 just for ur mores  take it or gtfo
if you have it we already have it

  nice fanfic nerd
  your gif answered that question unironically
    vidya meets cardboard papercraft what does /po/ think of this synthesis
  4/20  6999  nice
  fucking awesome cant wait to get this for my son
its not free    
i cant believe that /v/  cardboard did this
  yes it is    
  their source is an old article you fucking retard  
so whats the point of buying labo cardboard if you can just print the designs at a graphic store for less     right back at ya
  a thread that was 10 years old died for this
  4 months but what ever
  ease of use/mind for the uninformed like prebuilt pcs or anything else where you pay someone for something you could personally do cheaper
hello this is your wakeup call youre an adult whos about to pay an absolutely ridiculous amount of money for some branded cardboard  stop it
  so i found out the patterns are not free but say someone found a way to scan the pattern and upload it online could nintendo do anything about it
  sorry satan but fun is fun
  the problem will not be the patterns those will probably be not officially available on the internet at day one  the problem is even if you get and build the cardboard thingies for free you still need the games
  the software comes bundled with the patterns
  im a fucking retard sorry
  the gaming community has millions of grown adults paying thousands upon thousands for intangible rewards that are based on the luck of the draw you should consider that satan
that music killed my brain cells
  sounds like retarded kiddy shit
  couldnt have said it better myself
bump
well heres some new information for those that are still interested in this    variety kit      giant robot kit  
no replacement parts ever
  nintendo is tapping into some odd shit i never would have imagined that they could somehow recycle cardboard into an overpriced accessory but here we are     there are soyboys that will buy this shit up absurd the genius of nintendo is offset by the total stupidity of anyone dumb enough to pay 80 for a cardboard robotjust because it has a nintendo branding absurd    this is capitalism working correctly
  just watched enough of this video to confirm my previous statement nintendo could put branding on one of their outgoing trash bags and people would buy it
whoa
  /v/ is a cancer that will consume this place along with /vg/ later this year i almost miss the sporadic pools closed raids and the /pol/ misclicks compared to this
i think the posters here have missed one little point here  it also has a group of games for kids which come with the cardboard so it is impossible to just make it and play unless you are also copying the software
i thought a majority /po/ would be more excited about this
  its a 70 pice of cardboard i think you need to back to /v/
question does anyone have a good blueprint for the labo man
comes out 2morrow who else buying here
all of you fucks can just download the designs from here    
im surprised that there was no 2nd shitstorm after labo was released
    removing the color is ez in inkscape
  thank you based /po/ster
  more baby labo stuff
  kind of looks retarded in the commercials
nice any idea wher to get replacements of the other parts     also what dimensions are those printed 35cmx50cm
  the scale is missing and theyre definitely not meant to be printed on a4
      doesnt look so bad not worth 80 but i could see it at 50 with their other games
  wifes son  ftfy
  my wifes son loves it
where can i find good tutorials for making paper fractals youtube doesnt help much
hey /po/ im looking for some 1/150 scale paper craft city buildings for a kaiju diorama display im making    ive found some myself but i just wanted to check here to see if there are any others that you guys have since youre probably more experienced with looking for this stuff than i am
  there might be a couple you could use here    
  or maybe here    
  heres another site you can get 1150 scale highrise city buildings    
  would you be able to post the buildings you have
  it says they are 11500 tho
  here is a 1/144 scale hangar      also try this site     not sure of the scale tho
  is your kaiju paper craft as well im working on pretty much the same thing however my godzilla is made out of clay but i had the exact same idea for buildings
        this gave me some great ideas for jerking off
  this just tells me that you are a jerk off
ive never had the chance to build this but am pretty sure itll work just fine
can anyone help me with this cp i unfortunately suck at cps and have been waiting for the diagrams for this model but seems like they will never get released any sort of help is appreciated
now that looks complex
picture of the model or at least a name might help dont make it a challenge to help you
  probably a lizard or dragon with the scaling pattern along the diagonal could be a bug or scorpion or something
    filename
  please see the file name its the motorcycle by itagaki yuichi
  dont attempt this if you suck at cps i think its not that hard but for a beginner it will be a nightmare

  very nice i dont have permission to do anything
i been doing all of otms crease pattern challenges so maybe i can help    its a diagonal grid of 72 which is 3x3x2x2x2 so fold diagonal 3rds then one of those thirds into thirds then add the halfs    heres a picture of where things are at i dont know motorcycle anatomy tho     the two dewlaps come together and lock together so theres just one  crimp the wheel sections in and out all the way across on both sides first then fold the middle bike section eventually you can just spread the wheel sections out to make them it was easy that way to me anyway
  ty kind sir these landmarks will definitely help
 good luck
can anybody help me solve this cp some photo diagram or some reference point thanks
it looks like its from a computer program it doesnt give you angles honestly dont know about these    anyway if you do one half corner in halfs and the opposing sides one in thirds you get a reference point those are the yellow lines on the picture with the green lines being helpful lines you can get from the point
  this may help  
like geometrical origami more than figurative/animal origami  however  i dont like folding huge grids for tessellations or making tens of modules for modular constructions  i enjoy the process of folding a figurative model but hate shaping it since im not an artist and it comes out looking bad  this means that the only models i would completely enjoy making are the really simple ones without any shaping and those are not interesting to me or anyone else at all is there anyone with the same feelings
i like figurative origami better but i also dont like shaping thats probably why i have a shit ton of not finished origami projects stuck somewhere between the geometric base and the final model     i still find shaping rewarding afterall i find that my finished origami are pretty good but the shaping just take forever and its not funny to fold so yeah i know that feel also folding a huge grid isnt fun to anyone    but you can still find some figurative origami that require only little shaping/interpretation and still look good
  if you want to fold animals without shaping try komatsu hideo models they are great even without any shaping  there are geometrical figures from one sheet of paper too look for some of john montrolls books
 this one you say
  not op but thanks for the pdf m8
  im op and thanks for the pdf m8
  file deleted
  im op and i dont even remember what it was perhaps a meme i dont know
  i can now access the o c t a h e d r o n
  i used to be a big fan of modular origami as well i tried a lot of different designs and this one stood out as the one i liked the most if someone can find the instructions it its pretty easy to make and more stable than a lot of other designs once you put it together you can make a cube with 6 a star with 12 and a larger star with 36  i think however if you try to make shapes any larger than that it becomes unstable
  thanks man
its a variation of the sonobe model which is pretty easy 
  video instructions for the specific sonobé variation used for these icosahedra    3 colors is sufficient
  theres all kinds of modular stuff out there to work with
  indeed
  it was a meme cant remember what it was though for this inconvenience have two complementary memes on the house im the op
  yes for example hideo komatsus horse other extreme would be robert langs praying mantis which is  technically really simple for a complex model but the shaping on the final two pages takes forever
i enjoy shaping the figure out its just the last piece to add is always the worst one since i end up crushing the surrounding units
    your images have absolutely nothing to do with the topic at hand if you are going to talk origami then post images of what you are talking about we dont need your crappy memes
hello /po/    this may be a kind of a weird thread here but i think that if anyone can help me it is you guys    i am an entomologist and i need a reliable way to make beetle cards just like the one pictured here these cards are used to mount really small specimens and are used in three sizes ranging from 5x9mm to 10x20mm    i thought about using punches or paper cutting dies but they cant be made with these little round corners my currently idea is to cut it with a guillotine but i have not found a way to round these corners radius of around 05mm    can you guys help me    thank you very much and sorry for being kinda offtopic
this is a quick draw i made from the cards to give a better idea they should be cut from a thicker paper like 0020 thick card stock or something like that
    well it is a paper related thing and this is a place with people that work with paper
  id personally use a hand scalpel like the lads in the stencilling thread to round the corners off maybe 2030 seconds cutting per slide providing you have the slides all the size you want them but youll probs find more success in /an/ /sci/ /diy/ or /wsr/  more of an artsy board this itd be like asking architectural advice on /i/    good luck regardless anon hope you mount some mean fucking beetles
make a die out of a stronger material like wood or plastic and stack your blanks up then clamp that shit down really tight near the corner and sand it with some really fine sandpaper to match the blanks on top and bottom otherwise you could use a mini plane for woodworking to follow the blanks but sandpaper is way cheaper thats how you would do a real stack though clamp them and wood plane them with a mini plane on a shallow angle and a new blade good luck op
      thank you both these are both great ideas i will try it out i dont know anything about papercraft or origami so sorry for the unrelated topic i thought it would be at least somewhat related
have you looked at corner rounders from scrapbooking craft shops     heres a photo of a cheap one purchased from a china based ebay merchant sent postage free for a couple of dollars to canada
this thread still has a birthday hat and i want to preserve that fact
my face when i come on /po/ and an image of one of my specimens is on the board  anyway british entofag here  i buy my cards from the czech republic the one pictured is from a site called paradox even after postage i think they are affordable high quality cards at standardised sizes    considering the amount of time spent preparing specimens its not really worth spending all that extra time trying to save a few pence
any recommendations for some good beginner origami
crane
any books by john montroll  any modular or sonobe
  even better a swan
ey /po/ one of the new pokemon from pokemon sun and moon version is kartana it looks like this can you make it in real life with origami and if so how    /vp/
its possible but youd need a rather large square and there would be quite a bit of paper wasted on the premise that this thing has too many long limb like flaps    either that or you make it from several sheets
cortana is an computer program not an pokémon theres no way you can actually make it in origami form    for an serious answer yes
    yeah orange white and yellow is difficult to work with
someone should do a modular model for this
looks like a couple of people have now
no instructions for either of them though that im aware of
of course they are like 3 weeks now on the net a kartana papercraft pdo file on the net just use google people is it that hard
  w2c those oragami gloves
        origami is not the same as papercraft those are papercraft we are discuting origami
    papercraft instructions       i bet that op meant papercraft most people think that origami means anything with paper
  awesome it would have been the worst waste of potential if this hadnt happened  i mean pokémon literally made this for /po/
  origami means papercraft in chinese
  triggered  it means folding paper in japanese
hands down best pokemon
    isnt is a super beast
you need to do bird base
i dub thee /po/kemon
  ultra beast dont know where super came from on your comment
i wonder if you could also do necrozma with papercraft since its so angular
    agreed it was a /po/or joke
wow
  nice
hope to see papercrafts of the new necrozma forms or whatever they are though the solgaleo and lunala bits arent so angular so it could be more trouble than its worth
bump
  that new ultra beast assembly would make for a good papercraft also nice dubs
has anyone made a glass sculpture of a nihilego
buzzswole origami when     also dubs
  fuck off calac
   
            checked
  
  checkem

first kartana in pokemon  now nintendo labo  it keeps happening
bumping an ancient thread
i wouldnt mind a celesteela one to go with my other pokemon papercrafts making the palettes would be a bitch though
we need to save some ancient threads here keep bumping so they wont go under
  also save the designs so we can repost/make a new thread thats /po/ related
isnt this just the new mecha from darling in the franxx
  you just have to fold it in pure white then color it in afterwards
i heared that is a trend in japan and its used for good luck they look exactly like kartana
    is it considered poor sport to use multiple sheets in origami
  wow i am the first post in april 2018 awesome    happy april fools day /po/
this is probably the oldest nonmod posted thread on 4chan right now pretty cool if you ask me
  theres one over at /i/ that was from 2014  it was nearing the archives so i gave it a bump
  i wonder what made it stay
  i was gonna go dig up the ancient /t/ thread but it looks like it finally fell off oldest one there is from 2015 now
  wrong see 
  you wish  
  666 days old  woah  if the 666 trips were anywhere close this thread this day wouldve been the perfect fit for them
the only thing youre meant to do with paper is wipe your ass other than that youre an autistic fuck
  yes  also printed details are not allowed  also cutting is forbidden  all kartana posted are papercraft not origami
  t /vp/
  even /pol/ manages to show some common courtesy when they visit this place due to misclicking but you pokemonfags cant even do that
is there a way to import a pepakura file with its texture into a program like sketchup so i can draw over it and create a 3d model with popped and recessed detail ive got mechs i want to 3d print that are only available in papercraft form
  you may want to ask /g/
if pepakura file is not locked you can export geometry in obj format with designer    i never did it but i think its posible
i cant help you because i dont know anything about 3d printing but can you post that file so i can make it too 
got any
  looking for similar to these 11 for one is way too high i could buy a real pumpkin anybody know of a good cheap/free papercraft halloween decoration set
_ツ_/
did the geometry myself
fkn cool reminds me of a luger i did back in highschool wish i kept it  how did you manage to make the arms and legs like that is it similar to the thingy on bread bags
  thats exactly it layered on some paper over it as well
  neeto any plans on sharing
  these bits are a bit sloppy but other than that great job do you intend to share this tamplate or is it just one off thing

hello /po/ i like to leave small origami models like pic related wherever i sit could you send me some more small simple origami models so i can start doing different stuff apart from swans bonus points if you post instructions
  you got the crane a classic you probably know
  and the frog another traditional model they have a hole between the legs where you can blow to make them round and cuter  both diagrams come from origami club which has easy models some too childish
  they have a hole between the legs where you can blow  impressive very nice
  damn forgot to mention the innuendo
  i think boat is the simplest and it is easy to do in small scale     i make boats out of my sub receipts takes about 20 sec to make
i started leaving my designs around while i was shopping for a while 9/10 theyre likely tossed but i like to think one or two people shopping picked some up
i leave origami too  this humming bird is an example but my tyranosaurus and diplofocus are at origamiresourcecom under the pen name ruben rodriguez
was posted in another thread but its cute and easy to fold with small paper

  same asshole from the other thread that got deleted why you mad
so i recently got into team icos games and i found out that they released some official ico papercraft a few years back but im having trouble locating the models does anyone happen to have them i believe there were 4 2 of the main characters and some scenery
  here ya go enjoy  
  cool thanks  much appreciated are these a4 size
  i believe so except for the first and last image their resolutions are only 510x725 while the other are 800x1000 so the other 2 might not look so good but better than nothing 
hello im looking for a good book/video series to start off my origami adventure but im not sure what to start off with i know a couple designs by memory but theyre really basic any advice
  john montroll  teach yourself origami is pretty simple
was anyone there at the getty museum to see robert j lang in person
who the fuck is robert j lang
  yeah he was super rude to me i told him can i borrow some of his expensive handmade papers but instead he slapped my ass and kicked me out  ill never fold any other model from him
  papercraft scum get out    wait what
  i saw robert j lang at a grocery store in los angeles yesterday i told him how cool it was to meet him in person but i didnt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for tips aor anything    he said oh like youre doing now    i was taken aback and all i could say was huh but he kept cutting me off and going huh huh huh and closing his hand shut in front of my face i walked away and continued with my shopping and i heard him chuckle as i walked off when i came to pay for my stuff up front i saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen milky ways in his hands without paying    the girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional and was like sir you need to pay for those first at first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter    when she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually to prevent any electrical infetterence and then turned around and winked at me i dont even think thats a word after she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly
    those are funny af but depressing at the same time i didnt know sir robert lang was a douche disappointed
  anon its copypasta an old one at that
i went to the getty museum to see some getty images
how do i request that the mods delete this thread  mods mods mods  i cant post much else because of it
fuuuuuuuuuuuuck its tooo old to delete fuck
my hard drive recently shat itself and i lost all my templates including modelik templates thats the most upsetting part  basically this thread is dedicated to sharing your favoririte templates with a man whove lost it all
  no it isnt its for sharing with everyone  youre hard drive failure is your problem not ours so you can search the internet for all your template needs  good luck with your searches
  this post was just another excuse to put more garbage in /po/  please delete this one too  it really has no relevance in here
even a pdf would not hurt
  the author name is hoang tien quyet    i didnt find the pdf and i dont know if this model be in some book    there are a cp only
    hoang tien quyet  wouldnt doubt its him reminds me of his designs especially his eye of horus
models and tips for a beginer
  drawing on the paper  ishygddt
  this hurts me on an extremely deep level
1 buy patterned paper with pretty colours and fold with it if you dont have any white printer paper is a good substitute  2 do not hesitate to draw on the paper make the model yours it will be beautiful i recommend permanent whiteboard markers draw your lines two or three times to set the colour in i also suggest coloured pencils generally make sure to include at least two colours in a model  3 googly eyes are a must if you want your models to look professional  4 origami elitists and other jerks will tell you to make sharp accurate creases ignore that  the model will look nice either way and you shouldnt waste so much time on that stuff it often wont even make a difference if you start witha perfect square or not  a4/letter sheets are okay too  5 the same people would insist that real origami uses no cuts as before ignore them  there are some really nice origami spiders and crabs whose legs are made this way try them  6 for learning new models nothing beats origamicom which has good instructions in clear and polished english quality stepbystep animations and a variety of fun models many of which are inspired by the best culture in the world the japanese culture  7 if books are more your thing i heartily recommend the one in the picture you can find a shining review of it here goo dot gl slash 1ggdrc  8 and finally if you prefer video as a form of instruction the best origami youtube channels are in spanish but thats not a big issue because just seeing the paper is enough to understand what to do just search como hacer origami  and an array of quality tutorials will be at your fingertips  with all that said i hope i gave you enough information to get yourself started and much more and remember if you have difficulties /po/ is a helpful and active place to ask and your question will be answered within minutes happy folding 
  dont listen to  those look so cute
  power
