    this one was a washed out blue mess when i took it  im surprised i was able to get anything out of it had to crank the temp slider to maximum    anyway i appreciate the composition advice  the only thing really conflicting with it though is how close to subjects you have to be underwater  the strobes really only have a 45 max effective range the shark in the old thread  was probably only 23 feet away from my camera doesnt leave alot of extra space in the photo when photographing large subjects the only way i can think i can work around that is by buying a superwide lens and dome  however i can apply the advice easily to smaller subjects and macro shooting thanks    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makeolympus imaging corpcamera modelem5camera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2017 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/40color filter array pattern894focal length 35mm equiv18 mmimagespecific propertiesimage width4608image height3456number of bits per component8 8 8pixel compositionrgbimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20181127 234337exposure time1/60 secfnumberf/40exposure programcreativeiso speed rating800lens aperturef/40exposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash autofocal length900 mmcolor space informationuncalibratedimage width1000image height750renderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardgain controlhigh gain upcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal
    oh i might as well add that ive read that pros will often use the sun in shallow water to help illuminate larger objects the strobes wont cover so thats always an option unfortunately i dont find myself in that situation often when something big comes along    anyway i see what you two mean now after going through my folder about everything being centered single focus etc now i know what to work on for my next trip
  best one of the ones youve posted      dramatic clouds nice        i prefer the colour one i find that in the black and white you lose some depth in the trees also the slight blue colour adds a melancholy atmosphere      great shot but i might crop in on the waterfall a bit more      would be better with an animal or person in the frame to give it some life          the other anon was right if youre trying to do something abstract you have to take the photo from a vantage point people wouldnt normally see it from      solid portrait      cool turtle        too dark and centered underwater is hard as balls though so decent shots considering      i really like this one i just wish the walls werent so dark so you could get more texture but being underwater really limits you that way    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makecanoncamera modelcanon eos 6dcamera softwarecyberlink photodirector 8 windowsimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution240 dpivertical resolution240 dpiimage created20181128 010607exposure time20 secfnumberf/50exposure programmanualiso speed rating250lens aperturef/50exposure bias0 evmetering modepatternflashno flash compulsoryfocal length5000 mmrenderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balancemanualscene capture typestandard

  colour with some editing but really the picture lacks sharpness which is a big issue for this kind of photo looks really blurry what lens are you using sort of looks like it isnt even centered properly that amount of blur in the foreground is nasty      this would be great as part of a set it is a really nice photo but it has little power if it doesnt connect to something else id really see it as part of a reportage though    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makecanoncamera modelcanon eos 5d mark ivcamera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2018 windowsphotographergiacomo fimagespecific propertiesimage width4422image height6632number of bits per component16 16 16compression schemeuncompressedpixel compositionrgbimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage data arrangementchunky formatimage created20181127 092421exposure time1/160 secfnumberf/18exposure programmanualiso speed rating200lens aperturef/18exposure bias0 evsubject distance000 mmetering modepatternflashflash compulsoryfocal length13500 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width693image height1039renderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balancemanualscene capture typestandard

  really cool look
  raw is good but if theres no information in blacks then bumping up wont save them  for night try to work with the darkness as negative space never done underwater but i imagine its difficult as hell to get good lighting and wide apertures for that        for the cave one work on isolating the diver and light keep the rest of blacks and shadows of the cave dark with only barely detail zone i and ii bring up light on the diver and emphasize colors and lights flowing through water casted on diver might have to play with colors to get diver to stand out in light  heres some inspo for what you could go for      this ones actually pretty good do some post procesing wiht lighting and colors and you have decent photo

  good black/white levels  but i like it more blue like in original  just tone it down a bit so its like this     you could also spotedit the white balance/saturation for the diver to get him slightly more normal  keep in mind although its technically correct to white balance to a neutral white you can allow some of that blue lighting in the final image to convey that it really is underwater after all just like you would not white balance away a golden sunset    just google underwater cave diving photography for some more inspo

  spooky      almost a good shotshame you cant see his hand on the fretboard         if youre trying to focus on the inside of each room and its contents eg girl then theyre too dark if youre trying to focus just on the light and shadows then its too bright not really sure what youre going for here      this isnt your school yearbook       the color is far too artificial be more subtle
  i was actually trying to focus more just on the light/shadows and my girlfriend happened to be there and i liked the way that it looked   so darker for just the light/shadows  its not as if i dont want the rest of the room to not be seen i feel like it plays a part in the rest of the photo and drawing the eyes in what specifically would you change about the first photo for example

  this one is mine    i like this one the color version isnt as good imo    solid though a bit simple        okay but not quite enough    feels really cramped but it isnt bad              solid underwater work i like all of these    i like it but it feels like you took the pic at a slight angle and its throwing me off    feels kind of john carpenter i can dig it    i like the bokeh of course but the subject is awkwardly far up    its a picture of some boats    i like what youre going for but like the other anon said the colors are unnatural    really good cosplay portrait    i actually like the look of this    like    really like    its ok    its ok    i like it    i agree with the first anon    no    weird flex but ok    nah    its a neat texture but the dof isnt helping    most of it is one color crowded blurry    i like how you put the sun over the little mist point so it looks like its a rocket blasting off    hd snow boring    hd snow but more pleasing to the eye    this feels like two different pictures im not sure what the overall subject is supposed to be    my favorite this is cool looking    cool looking shot    nice were you in the creek or on a bridge    i like it but its a bit noisy on the eyes    its almost good but the tree isnt in focus so including it is just distracting from the beauty of the in focus landscape behind it    im ok with this    i like this despite myself its kind of timeless    i want to like it but i dont

  nice subject failed attempt    you want to show the plant but you also show a tree some twigs and a blurry lake the background is very distracting the perspective is boring  get closer      nice the tones especially      boring    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce6000camera softwarecapture one 110 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/10imagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiexposure time1/60 secexposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating250brightness10 evexposure bias2 evmetering modespotlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryimage width1200image height800renderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal
  boring snapshit    looking for feedback  the leaf is a jagged texture but you are putting it infront of a background that is also a jagged texture and the same color too so it doesnt stand out you can visualize this by turning the photo grayscale squinting at it so it blurs a bit then see what your eye will naturally be drawn to theres usually two things contrast and brightness in this case theres no contrast because color is the same luminance of background foreground is the same and texture is the same and if you go with brightness then your eye gets drawn to the patch of background on the far left of photo    theres nothing compelling someone to look at the leaf no subject/background separation sure muh 50/18 babbys first prime lens wide open bokeh but that does not overcome the poor texture contrast  also theres no composition to speak of its just a fucking leaf centered in frame

  heres an edit
  i know the colors are bad i was fucking around with the sliders
  sign my yearbooook
      the sky looks to rich to me the oranges and blues seem just over saturated and the pier seems ultra crisp nothing major still a good photo
  what are you trying to show with this image if its how run down the room is then a white light isnt a good choice makes is it seem sterile if you used an incandescent light thatd help the atmosphere of he shot in my opinion also never hurts to have people in the frame      i like it if you took this again try to have the book and table take up the whole frame the striped background keeps pulling my eye away from the book

which is better    going to print it for a gift
    thx steve 3
  yeah this is very fair i just thought the room was pretty cool looking there was no power i found it in an old abandoned building it was very dark so i used a flash do you think i could try to edit it any better/differwnt to help with the feel of the image im still a pretty big photography noob so i appreciate the help
my recent
  simple fix to help that image would be to adjust the white balance to a warmer value     if you back there and shoot bring a powerful incandescent flashlight and use that maybe have someone stand in the beam and cast a shadow on the walls
  i like the one on the right better seeing the surface helps give you a sense of place in the image plus its brighter and catches the eye better
  lighting and framing on the right is way better

  this one im unsure of only because of where i initially ended up shooting it from   the house itself was up on an incline and i was out standing on the street which was quite a bit lower and going downhill on a slant so it turned out a bit wonky i think    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cs6 windowsimagespecific propertiesimage width1648image height2048number of bits per component8 8 8pixel compositionrgbimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution96 dpivertical resolution96 dpiimage created20181202 221939exposure time1/125 secfnumberf/71lens aperturef/71exposure bias0 evfocal length4750 mmcolor space informationuncalibratedimage width805image height1000
and heres a one off from when i was walking the dog this evening that i just snapped with my phone but having posted my shit ill reply to some shit      i actually quite like this but i wish that the little plant was a bit more in focus i really like the idea though almost like a naturally occurring terrarium if that makes any sense looks like you went a little buckwild with the editing in  though which is fine it just looks a little oversharpened nice job though    christ thats a long photo but im sort of glad that it is lots of different stars to look at and you get a neat nightsky gradient effect i know basically fuck all about these long exposure shots but ive always enjoyed them if anything i sort of wish that there was a bit more landscape to balance the picture out toward the bottom i still really like it though    not sure what you were going for i like the trees that said cool it with the sharpen slider/tool it looks like youre trying to make a stencil out of the picture    right one is definitely more interesting     personally theres not a lot in this photo that catches my eye some drab buildings that are off kilter and in a weird perspective you might benefit from fucking around with the perspective tool in lightroom or even vsco    well if you know the colors are bad why would you leave it that way its at least an interesting subject but the colors are just blasted and offputting    simple enjoyable to look at if not a bit over saturated     tricky its a cool looking room so congrats on finding it but its a wildly dull and offputting shot it looks like you came to repossess the house and your boss told you to take pictures of the rooms so that he could see what they looked like try and spend some more time editing and decide what youre trying to show with your shot and what you want to highlight and potentially discard    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertiesimage width1626image height2048number of bits per component8 8 8pixel compositionrgbimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution96 dpivertical resolution96 dpiimage created20181202 222745exposure time1/40 secfnumberf/24lens aperturef/24brightness07 evexposure bias30 evfocal length600 mmcolor space informationuncalibratedimage width794image height1000
the picture i posted in  was the one i was unsure of btw not   crits/replies cont    nice trips i could see this maybe being an album cover or something but the noise factor is insane also you might try to crop it down to make it a bit more interesting    nice perspective good use of black and white i really like the lighting in this shot even if the highlights are a little blown out    cool shot a little drab but i think thats what you were going for i like it quite a bit    i dont really think this is over saturated at all this is probably the best shot in the thread great framing great colors great lighting really nice shot man    this is also a really good shot if you still can i would try to get the whites/highlights turned down a bit so that it doesnt quite rape the eyes as much toward the top of the shot    the dude in the thread who said to shoot the whole person is an autist lmao i also like this shot a lot  said it best        i like these but at the same time they seem sort of snapshitty like you just took them and didnt do any editing/processing afterward which is all fine i guess you do seem to have a good eye for perspectives and interesting composition though if i had to critique one in particular id say in  you probably should have avoided trying to cut the persons legs off toward the bottom of the calves    pretty dull could use a subject somewhere in there its just grass and some thicc fog    i like this one a lot more good autumn colors fog plays a good part and theres actually some stuff to look at and catch the eye i still think a larger subject in this might be better but good job
  actually you know what im pretty sure i hate this shot composition is all wack and the theme i was going for didnt really come through as well as it did in the other three oh well

  good lord where is this i love this architecture and  why no its not granted it doesnt really fit with the other two but its a nice shot the architecture inframe looks scifi in a way mundane cat statue bugs me though
  folsom ca more specifically the old historic area of folsom if youre looking for specifics its just one of the houses on one of the main streets that run through there the house itself was actually really cool but i just didnt like this shot compared to the others i posted glad you like it though

  cool shot ocean looks great and the rays of sun are particularly cool i would recommend probably cropping it down so theres not a giant bright spot right at the top of the photo unless thats what you were shooting for you also probably want to make sure that the horizon is straight and not slightly crooked
  wew nice
  jup like said crop the blob off and align horizon stunning shot
  boring    whats that    2abstract4me    thats a nice shot like the textures    would work if it were someone popular    boring but nice tones    i like the autism level on that pic      boring    the house wall is more interesting  should have made a shot of the tree and the house those oranges look nice     underexposed no    leaf not in focus

  lurk more faggot  
  according to dxomark its the huawei p20 pro but they are all garbage anyways so why start a thread about phone cameras
  thanks but already seen that thread i dont want pics from your shitty iphone 5s or galaxy s3
  thats like asking which is the best swiss army knife to shave ones face sure you can do it but its not going to deliver good results in the end     on a more serious note phone cameras are so shit they are only good for the best of shooting conditions ie bright daylight the quality difference between them then rests in autofocus response time and mega pickles count noise performance is shit across the board     why a serious shooter would not even consider an entry level rabal is beyond me when the rabal offers so much more creative leeway and iq over a smrt phone
  and no one wants shitty pics from your iphone x
  also please dump any shots youve taken from your high end smartphones galaxy s9/note 9 iphone xs p20 pro etc i wanna see just what quality you can get out of these things now  want phone image thread post there you want to discuss phones post there
  which smartphone has the best camera  the answer is and always will be the latest flagship doesnt even matter which one iq differences will be minimal
    look at this pleb with his answers from 2014 lets all point and laugh at him    there are substantial differences among the flagship models these days they all ship with different arrays of lenses proprietary approaches to computational photography video capability stabilization etc
  pixel line
  yes and in the grand scheme of things they still manage to suck hard compared to the vast majority of digital cameras it doesnt matter that apple has better colors than samsung and huawei has more dynamic range than lg and so on and so forth when theyre all washed away by any contemporary dedicated digital camera its like making a contest between homeless people on whos the richest sure one might have double the money of someone else but were still talking about pennies
    and if ops question was do 2018 flagship phones compete with a dedicated camera your response would be totally germane and relevant however its not and youre making an argument against a conclusion that no one made
the one you have with you
pixel 3 has the best software  note 9 has the best colors and zoom  p20 pro has a huge 40 mp lossless and good low light     all inferior compared to digital cameras but if id have to recommend if you want to be an instashotter go for a xiaomi
  thanks mayne
  well i asked /sqt/ for something to take pics with and i was given the just use your phone answer and the buy cheap ps answer
as a general rule smartphones are good for photos onthefly by that i mean pics of the kids at the restaurant documenting damaged stuff rcvd in shipment at the office or general stuff for serious photos however we use the canon eos 35mm dslr
i dont really take serious photos on my phone only shots of things i want to send to people or remember so heres a shot of my 1 month old lovebird babies in extreme low light the funny thing is that my s9 btfos my dslr in these super low light handheld situations since none of my lenses have vr not only is my fastest lens a 18 compared to 15 on my phone but i can also go down to about 1/2 sec handheld without shake so i only need about 200 iso for the same exposure as 6400 iso on my d800 if i really need it i can do 1 sec handheld take a few shots because most will be blurry and go up to 400 iso for even more exposure 400 iso looks horrible though with this particular shot i couldnt go as low with the shutter speed as the subject wasnt still    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera modelsmg965fcamera softwareg965fxxu2bri3equipment makesamsungfocal length 35mm equiv26 mmmaximum lens aperturef/15imagespecific propertiesimage orientationunknownimage created20181112 134728horizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiiso speed rating1000exposure programnormal programunique image idi12llkf00sm i12lllf01gm_fnumberf/15exposure time1/9 secfocal length430 mmflashno flashmetering modepatternscene capture typestandardexposure bias0 evimage height3024white balanceautobrightness42 evimage width4032exposure modeautolens aperturef/15color space informationsrgb

  iphone xs overall  use halide to shoot raw    your lovebirds are beautiful asf how do you manage with 4 of them
  most xiaomi products are great but smartphone cameras have disappointed me   coincidentally i have their robot vacuum running into my feet right now
took this on iphone x the other night it uses a sony sensor the new xs uses samsung sensor so it may look identical to the galaxy phones    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertiesimage orientationbottom righthandhorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpicolor space informationsrgbimage width4032image height3024scene capture typestandard
  actually smartphone cameras are decent quality you just need to get by their post processing try using lightroom cc camera in ios
  thanks anon i have a decent sized walk in aviary for them although i havent released the lovebirds in there yet their parents have their own separated corner in the aviary because theyre vicious to the other birds but its not going to be big enough for 6 of them so ill need to expand it before moving them out theyre raising hell in my room constantly flying around flying on top of my head and once one is up there the rest follow and start wrestling and fighting for space then the one who slips off does a lap and attempts to land on the back of its siblings theyre constantly burrowing into the blankets digging themselves into any sort of tight space and just chirping in there or falling asleep so its difficult to find them etc but im really glad all four of them turned out healthy and are completely tame
screw dat
why are you photography faggots such virgins came here on /p for the first time ever just to ask some questions about taking photos saw this thread and was overwhelmed by the amount of faggotry
iphone x s second year edition
pixel 2 followed closely by iphone xs and galaxy note 9
ouch    should have probably just bought a new phone
  should i buy a pocomeme
was thinking about buying a rx100 iii can i get away with a pixel 3
  no but you can get decent quality images by shooting dng on the phone with lightroom cc available for both iphones and android    the biggest problem with phone photos is heavy jpeg compression because manufactures want to sell you 64gb phones lol shoot raw and your photos will be decent quality     pocket cameras are still way better though because you get unlimited storage and more importantly you wont drop your phone and cry
  depends on what you want to shoot for example in nolight conditions only the cat s60 because it doesnt require light at all
claims that youtube photographers is 99 shills he tries to save you money  is ken right all along or is he autistic
  just look at him what do you think
he is definitely autistic but he has some nice insight on the less popular lenses sometimes
  hasnt been wrong yet and thats all that matters to me
  when you get all silly ass cosmetics for heavy weapons guy
perhaps his autism is weapon
  mfw one of his videos about the live feeds for solar observatories going down keeps ending up on /pol/
  im never ever watching your show but cool topper and pipe combo
  everyone is a fucking shill with over 100k subs even himself no one goes to being a popular tuber without starting to shill some shit at some point
  i only watch him sometimes because hes funny but hes mostly talking rubbish    hes shilling fujifilm extremely hard without giving a quantifiable reason
that lanier episode where they shoot at some ranch together and every single one of kens shot was blown out garbage was hilarious     fucking fraud
    yes his images looked like shit in that and they may be but he and jason both said kens images were submitted sooc where laniers had his famous over the top post production stuff     that makes it harder to compare as i say kens work might be shit anyway but in this case its not an apples to apples thing
  they are good cameras look it up use one and see for yourself and im a nikonfag
  not even trying to justify kens images but his didnt get edited jasons did
he is a shill himself but a different type  paid/endorsed/favoured by fujifilm to shit on their apsc competitor    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2017 windowsimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage created20180829 151003color space informationuncalibratedimage width4252image height3952
    hi theo    has your exwifes family forgiven you yet for being a graverobbing sack of shite
some psychological traits    likes to indirectly attack youtubers with higher subscription count via his sock puppet accounts  likes to pretend he is female on tumbler  likes to praise himself from his sock puppet accounts  likes to fish for sympathy on /p/ he writes stories about his dead wife in real life he will tell you a sob story to make you buy him a burger he did this to lanier on their day out    psychologically unstable mess would recommend to stay away from
  please show me on this doll where ken touched you
  fortunately im not the one who needs therapy    im just recommending people to stay away for their own safety
  fucking fujishills
  do you have a source on that why would he have sent unedited images to jason
  i wish i was so i could get free cameras all day    source   my eyes   why would he have sent unedited images to jason  no fucking clue dude lol my only guess is he thinks his fuji is so superior to the sony that he didnt need to     heres a pic ive taken can confirm angry photographer was not at foley square in nyc this day    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpicolor space informationsrgbimage width2436image height1626scene capture typestandard
  kens of the opinion that fuji has good sooc jpegs and editing isnt needed    yet further proof hes a gear nerd without the first fucking clue what hes doing
      sorry but our resident fat fuck is a fraud  he has been caught lying many times     he will shill for nikon or fuji like a bipolar person depending on who paid him the most ion that given month as the video shows
  link i want to lol
wtf are his videos on physics    because his camera videos are popular he is trying to get people to watch his conspiracy theories
  claims that youtube photographers is 99 shills   incorrect it is 100    or is he autistic  yes but they all are
  so what youre telling me is the the human thumb doesnt actually know how to postprocess and is a massive bullshit artist
  hes literally never claimed to be a photographer
  the art of photography is just as bad  sometimes even worse
    the source is in the video itself jason says ken sent me sooc images we did not discuss this beforehand    who knows why
    thats not exactly what he said but its close     what he said was that fujis film simulations were enough for what he wanted to do and he usually just went with them     he didnt say they didnt need post just that he didnt like doing it     frankly i do the same with my x100f a lot of times ill use the film sim bracketing feature when just screwing around and many times that processing is perfectly fine for social media uploads that kind of thing     theres no need to spend an hour in lr for a pic im throwing up on facebook of dog in a park or whatever
  actually admitting to using in camera film sims    holy keks anon i thougt you were a meme
    hah well okay then     like i didnt have a heck of a lot of respect for the guy anyway but knowing that he shoots fucking medium format in jpeg mode makes me discover that i had a tiny bit more that i could lose     and nothing intrinsically against shooting jpeg if that works for you but that did not work for him his pics looked like ass compared to laniers and a little bit of time in lightroom would have mitigated a lot of it not all of it though because hes also just not a very good photographer
  calls himself the angry photographer  never claimed to be a photographer    hmmmmm
  those tattoos  actually disgusting
  ive watched a few of his vids and he has put out a few ways to save some money but this guy is so cringey to me anyways i just cant watch him
  thats not even the creepiest part    he has some sort of personal obsession against thom hogan the northrups camera store chris lanier etc
  hes absolutely right but desu id rather listen to a shill than a dude with unmedicated bpd
  he knows his lenses but i agree i really cant stand his fat voice and personality any longer
  severe bpd dude needs therapy more than meds
  unfortunately therapy and meds dont work for personality disorders/psychopaths/sociapaths the only thing that works is no contact cutting off the narcissistic supply they crave     ken failed to achieve the adulation he deserves from his condescending rants about buddhism renewable energy pseudo science and questionable linguistic skills he then found that with a little study he could take his experience working in a camera shop and a term or so at college he could reinvent himself as the photographic guru he projects on youtube    sadly he has managed to build an almost cult like following on youtube ill admit hes a clever guy but regurgitating common knowlege isnt insightful hes a hack    as for his photography well creepshots at the beach test charts on his fridge and birbs on chimneys says it all anyone noticed that his studio lights have only moved in the last two years when he has dropped a sandwich behind them    i could go on
  plus the dude is a photo thief
  that is the least of his misdemeanours 
  is there any articles/evidence on that anon
  in real life he will tell you a sob story to make you buy him a burger he did this to lanier on their day out    what  is there proof of this
needs to use proper mic
  the video chuck jines made
    yeah lots of people like taking pictures and sharing them with friends immediately rather than spending 9 days fucking around in lightroom    its weird i know
  sure but if that were the case you probably dont have a real interest in photography and thus is moot
  if you want to share photos with people quickly you probably arent actually interested in photography   weird thats just a weird thing to say
  thats what seperates snapshot with photography  both snapshots and photographs are about memories but photography is a whole new world
  the art of photography dude doesnt look like a gay tattooed ball of fat whos constantly swearing though
  the only difference between photography and justify snapshots is the format the image data is stored in   this argument keeps getting weirder
why he haf 2 be so med
  maybe hes got dirt on them
  is ken right all along or is he autistic  both although hes been wrong on a lot of topics and blocked anyone that proves him so including me he thinks 42mm on ff focal length is human eye equiv and so on but better than other photo channels
  underrated
  hes the only nonshill photog channel on shilltubes  everyone else is getting shit for free and trying to sell it to you
  explain why he shills for fujifilm and shit on nikon one month then shills for nikon and shits on fujifilm the other month    then explain how he isnt a paid shill when he has admitted fujifilm has sent him leaks about hx1
  explain why he shills for fujifilm and shit on nikon one month then shills for nikon and shits on fujifilm the other month  he goes back and forth between different cameras and likes some shit they do and then hates it the next week people do that ive done that    then explain how he isnt a paid shill when he has admitted fujifilm has sent him leaks about hx1  how is he paid and hes blowing smoke up your ass about leaks he reads them on those leak websites like everyone else    anyway you dont seem to understand how photog on yt operate they get shit for free they praise it then they sell the products they got for free on ebay/craigslist and also sell you shit through affiliate links
  you dont seem to understand how photog on yt operate  the difference between you and me is i count hi as a shill and you dont    he goes back and forth between  thats not going back and forth  when you think medium format sensor is lightyears ahead and a week later thing ff is the best sensorthen you have a bipolar brain disorder
  the difference between you and me is i count hi as a shill and you dont  you seem to have a hardon for the guy im amazed that there are people like you around who waste their life away on hating some loser who talks about shit on yt
  i just like to agitate you every time you suck your own dick kendra
i thought we could talk about memory cards and card readers which you prefer and why
  that would be sandisk sdxc extreme pro/ultra v30 series theyre dirt cheap making them a steal just be aware to buy from authorized resellers many counterfeit cards exist and you should know some basic criteria to determine if the card is genuine otherwise you can get one for less than 40
i had a dacota platinum v10 lock its read/write mechanics to read only which kinda sucked unchangeable no matter how hard i switched it from read to write and the other way    i got two 32gb ones in my camera right now theyre nice
  the one you have with you  what a shit thread
  why tf would you start a thread about memory cards let alone gear    fucking hell regardless i use a lear prof 32gb cf card and 16gb sandisk extreme sd card i have no preference in any gear it was dirt cheap when i bought it and thats it
  card readers  i use a reader that i scavenged from an old wrecked case that i found in my neighbors shed
  i currently use a pair of these 128g in backup mode im considering upgrading to xqd though
  are there any card readers made in the united states
    anon nothing electronic is made in the us anymore
  okay japan or korea
i was looking at sd cards on bfriday and i saw these  anyone have experience with them the specs are pretty good
my photos have more detail and clarity when i save them on sandisk cards but i also use a goldplated usb cable for transfers it helps with focus too
  god
i use sandisk or transcend i just pick up whatever happens to be the cheapest at the time
  you should try angelbird then  the absolute best in terms of fine detail at least with my a7riii
  kingston is respected ram manufacturer no ideas how they do in sd cards      are these kill now when uhsii cards are offering 300/300 r/w speeds
  nope still twice as fast and up to 6gbit/s in the future because of sata sd cards wont be able to do anything like that
  this  whatever card as long as meets cameras specifications usually class 10 or above brand doesnt matter price should be as low as possible and thats all    local store sells 16gb for about 4 euros and 32gb for 6 euros kingston microsd cards i dont see a reason to buy anything else than those
  how do i find out what my camera is rated for
  enjoy your rotational velocidensity losses then kekold    this guy gets it
   these are the spares the ones in cameras are not much better
  i use a usb cord to the camera i dont use a card reader the card is pretty expensive and taking it out just means it will go bad faster or get lost or dropped etc once i put it in ive never taken it out except for when the camera was sent in for repair
  its in the user manual  you read it right
  i have some 256mb cfcards    i like to use them like films i have something like 42 photos to take and thats it
okay /p/ im feeling good enough to have you guys shit on my photos these are the ones ive been happiest with from the past 6 months all of these are shot on 120 6x7 and 6x45
thats probably it right now mostly wondering about my processing im never sure if it looks right when i do my own scans
  they look good dude what camera did you shoot with
 boring but cozy lighting   this could have been better as a landscape   so close    this one is realy nice but too bright       boring and cluttered    intresting subject but poorly composed   u could have shot it at waste level    i feel like ur biggest issue is composition  and u might be over exposing just a smidge but thats more of a personal taste thing
the composition of your shots is rooted entirely in how the image is framed/croppedthere is nothing interesting going on in terms of subject or lighting or post processing its like the people that take pics specifically for instagram it all looks good because you are limited in the amount of complexity you can communicate and youre basically imitating that with these cropped frames
  the over exposure lightning is feels good i wish you make this style but with epyyc subject and comp
overexposed boring and no composition fix these 3 things and youll be a decent photographer
  how is  boring and cluttered    get your head out your ass and gtfo out of here you cant judge for shit
  would like to add its ops best pic in this thread would have been better if op stood back and got more of the grass in but whatever  good job on    op
off topic but absolutely beautiful of a city where were these taken at
  great

im searching for a bag as well  backpack  opens from the back but not from the sides top or front top only if you can deprecate the important stuff  14 notebook pocket   secure pocket you can store phone keys wallet etc    saw ops back today on offer during amazons cyber week but i dont really dig the hurr tactical look
amazon basics backpack for slr/dslr  this is what i have 30 basic and does the job has what you described ive had it for a year now good quality and holds up to 5 to 6 lenses including the body
  forgot to reply to you captcha was being a gay post above me fits what you need
    thanks for the reply but it seems like this backpack opens like a regular backpack with opens from the back i meant the body part back  kinda like pic related    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpicolor space informationsrgbimage width630image height600scene capture typestandard
  look at the lowepro hatchback line
  i just did the same anon and went with a peak design sling as my everyday bag for hiking i purchased one of the peak design camera cubes so i can toss it into a real hiking backpack
i primarily carry my camera on me but i can put it in a compartment in my hiking bag     if i were to buy a bag specifically to hold gear it would be this one         no shill but if you can throw a bag 100 feet off the side of a fucking cliff and have your gear inside untouched it seems like its worth the 200 investment
  got the peak design 30l backpack it can carry a shitload kind of pricey but worth it
is there any shoulder bag for 70200 / 300mm lenses
  full frame or mirrorless either way check out peak design
not my picture but i have the same bag if you dont give a shit about protection this thing can fit your entire camera bag if you wanted it to
this one is my tourist bag  fits my 18135 zoom on on the camera cleaning kit and wallet
this one is my water proof bag    not just water proof but also 100 airtight
  100 airtight  idiot thats bad you want your bag to breathe for cases when you have wet gear
  if youre going to be in that situation just use silica gel in the bag
  i have this bag and i dont like it i have their older orangelined regular shoulder bag and its fucking way nicer you can tell they cheaped on quality with this newer iteration
  silica is good for some light humidity waterproof fabric is made out of fabric so its breathing this thing would be like carrying your cam in a plastic bag in a humid environment itll get damp just by opening it and there will be no way to get it out ok its not crazy bad should just keep a towel in at all times and shoot something thats not sony
im actually considering manufacturing my own kind of camera backpack because every one i try never seems to be a home run and im looking for a specific feature or 2 that nothing is currently offering    what do you all look for in a camera bag seems like the 2 most popular kinds are messengers/backpacks which kind do you use and why any features you wish your camera bag had     do you use a backpack to haul most of your gear or do you use it more for essentials i usually pack all of my gear in a bag but im wondering where the line is people draw when they go from using a backpack to bringing a pelican case with their gear in it
  kek
  bagpack  i need water food clothes maybe tripod  sidebag  i need camera few lenses  pocket strap  camera one lens max  30l backpack plus sidebag  need for having camera at hand water food camping equipment safety equipment camera two three extra lenses
  i carry something similar except with some cheap lens holders attached off ali express
ive had this backpack for about a month no complaints so far chose the freeline over the peak design because i dont like the latch/flap system on my everyday messenger bag
  great bag i love mine
  lowepro flipside 400aw is what i have it is a good backpack fits most of my gear as well
bought this and highly regret buying this messenger/bicycle bag looks cool but the top part that folds over is pretty obtrusive
  are there any chinese knockoffs
id need a front holding chest strap/fannypack but one that doesnt bulge from the side of my hip but is more accessible from my front left breast/chest kinda like how/where police officers have their walkietalkie mic/speaker located    itd be carrying my a6000  an extra lens  i really like changing lenses on the fly but never have a place to easily put the removed lens/have a free hand    having stuff close to my hip tends to fly about or give me a wider footprint which sucks amongst crowds    sounds stupid but basically a hybrid of a small bag heightadustably attached to pantssuspenders would be the ideal solution  if i have to diy something i can good with needle and thread so even a /p/ recommended fannypack that has a little rigidity can be modified    pic related just not so huge
  forgot pic
the best i could find fits my needs for traveling with a m/43 system accessories laptop and stuff i use to hike and shnitz like that
the perfect backpack doesnt ex
domke f803 is the perfect size bag  nicely fits a leica m body a few lenses meter and film  fits a 13 macbook and a novel when not used for a camera
  ive had one of these for probably 8 years now its a very legit bag for small cameras leica/a6000ish/fuji    good shit haha
    anyone knows a backpack thats similar to the lowepro mtrekker bp 150 but a little bit larger   like a normal backpack   from the back body but not from the sides and if from the top can be parted  secure   sleeve 14   for everyday carry stuff   cheap chink shit  inside pockets on the backsleeve that can be reached when not fully opened for wallet key phone etc    i looked trough so many shop pages and backpacks couldnt find anything so far that fit my needs pic related is not bad but too small
  get a lenovo passage 17 honestly a banger fucking pack
i bought this a month and a half ago before going to a 3 week vacation it proved to be an excellent choice in all regards  cullman ultralight daypack 300  i scoured several stores and checked dozens of backpacks the final choice was between this one and lowepro flipside 300 very glad i went this way the lowepro is just too bulky
  isnt that a dry bag what did you expect
  me again after searching even more even on kickstarter i stumpled upon this backback it has a lot of pockets for my just throw in shit and my notebook fits i like the idea of making it smaller/bigger depending on what you need       it has no speration system like a regular camera backback do you think one could use partition inserts to keep the gear organized milc user another idea would be to make an inner shelf out of eg xpvc/sintra/pvc foam and put velcro on it to use regular deviders found in every camera backpack
is there a name for this look and how do i replicate it i mostly just do wildlife stuff so i know fck all about studio lighting    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cc macintoshimagespecific propertiesimage created20180312t0123402000image width3193image height1800

  i really like this shot
  yeah metal print
  this is pretty magnificent
i have this 8x10 on my camera shelf atm
  this isnt worthy of a poster but i could see this as a 4x5inch on a table or something looks like it would work as a small print    cool subject but i think the composition is a bit lacking i wouldnt have printed it personally    bit of a weird angle but it works could see it working well as an 11x14     you should blow this up to 20x30 or larger fuckin based and redpilled needs to be poster sized    eh leaves a bit to be desired imo not a particularly strong or interesting landscape to me but hey to each their own im glad you had a photo you loved enough to print  i take large format landscapes constantly and hate them and never print them so at least youre ahead of me but i would suggest a longer lens or something theres a lot going on here and yet nothing going on here isolate small scenes    bit of a cliche with the car long exposure but 8x10 on a shelf isnt too obnoxious its a decent photo but just not very original

  i like this it reminds me of transparent city
  hanging in the studio as an oversized print on canvas taken during an encore performance at a lenny kravitz concert i shot i was looking for a decent crowd shot and the woman dancing on her chair just made the shot thoughts
  this shit is fucking beautiful i would love to see more of your work
  thats a pretty cool shot
  thanks i was at first pissed at the chick dancing around in front of me as i was trying to get a good crowd feel silhouette and she was in the way but then i saw it through the viewfinder and said theres my shot
  you shouldve used a model with bigger and perkier tits this had potential but was ruined by using a chubby model with small tits and no long wavy hair
  nice shot no doubt does it look okay printed though guess i wouldnt had it due to the noise and harsh highlights       thanks its sort of unique though i have other images with this effect but they are not quite as nice     i have pic related hanging next to it along with some others      i cant help but think that if i did you were here complaining about the shot showing nothing but tits    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce6000camera softwarecapture one 110 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/10imagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiexposure time1/60 secexposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating160brightness09 evexposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryimage width1200image height800renderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal

  it looks great on canvas and masks the noise it half looks like a painting and has a really wow effect on my clients when they walk into the studio i usually go for this type of shot at the end of a show the lighting and silhouettes are what im after    i printed one like this of a dave mathews show that hangs in my girlfriends living room that always has people commenting on what a unique shot it is there were blue and red lights combining to make an almost purple glow and it being an outdoor venue / amphitheater just made for a cool print wish i had time to post more here but between my it duties and photo gigs    hope these boards dont get all mucked up with ads with the split and all nice work everyone

ill post this in the interior thread too  im looking to get started with interior photography but i dont know where to begin not in terms of gear but building a portfolio should i be emailing interior designers/decorators and real estate companies for tfp shoots if so is this appropriate    hi ____  im a freelance photographer looking to build a portfolio for interior and architectural photography id be happy to take photos of your work to add to my work set and you may use the images for whatever purpose youd like    heres my current portfolio ______    thanks  ______      i dont know what youre expecting you can change the export to png or tiff if you really want but jpg is pretty optimal raw formats are for editing not for viewing
  raw format is for editing not for viewing  this makes sense my friend thank you i have no experience in interior photography however your draft seems professional and to the point its a win win try emailing open houses as well
  raw and jpeg are both formats for storing image data but theyre designed for different parts of the photography workflow     raw first off isnt actually one format but a term we use for the raw image data formats used by all serious digital cameras it might be canons cr2 nikon nef sony arw olympus orf the semicrossplatform dng or others even within one brands format each camera spits out slightly different raw data so programs that let you edit raws have to be updated for each new camera that comes out this alone makes it unsuitable for sending to other people but it gets worse raw is also ridiculous overkill in terms of image data for anything other than editing when you edit a photo you basically provide your software with a list of changes to make to the raw to make it look how you want but the way you want it to look is all anyone cares about its like going to a shoe store being shown all of the shoe options and then buying one pair but bringing all of the other options around with you in a big sack on your shoulder just in case someone wonders about the choices you didnt make for that reason raw files are usually in the tens or hundreds of megabytes whereas a jpeg is a few orders of magnitude smaller     finally you dont actually make edits to a raw file you make edits with a raw file you cant store edits into the raw file because its designed to be raw sensor data not raw sensor data plus changes to the raw sensor data when you edit something in lightroom youre basically making a list of instructions for lightroom on how to make a jpeg from the raw you started with and it saves those in its own internal database when you edit in photoshop it makes an internal copy of the bitmap data after converting it from raw and then you save changes in some other format there are very few edits that you actually make in the raw file itself
should i get a nikon d300 with 200k clicks for 160 it comes with the 1855 kit lens  first dslr btw
  redundant and question already answered
  good camera but the iso performance is bad like most cameras from that time and its really going to hurt you when you want to mess with exposure in raw files  id suggest spending more for a d3200 or the much better d7000/d7100 canon is also worth taking a look at albeit older nikon dslrs tend to be slightly better than older canon ones thanks to their sensors very small difference though and hasnt mattered for a long time
  youve ten gear threads stupid q thread turned into gearthread cmon ask there    and you dont answer him      this raw is not savable its blank capture from cameras sensor
  its a beginner question whats the matter    the iso performance doesnt really seem that bad to be honest for that amount of money i cant get anything better than that
arent you guys afraid of nig bogs stealing your pictures
  im sure your pictures are garbage that nobody would care about anyways
  how is this thread any different from /sqt/
  irrelevant
  dont post your photos online if youre mentally ill
  and here i thought this was a helpful thread
  it is if you re paranoid about people stealing your photos online dont post them in the first place simple
  buy 2k computer  buy 1k camera  countless hours of editing  lenses lenses everywhere  take breathtsking photos  show no one  how stupid are you
  it is relevant though because what the fuck even is stealing in this context if youre not making money off it and neither are they
  buy 2k computer  buy 1k camera  countless hours of editing  lenses lenses everywhere  take breathtsking photos  is paranoid that someone might steal it online
if your want to take landscape shots out in the middle of nowhere thats federal lands can just drive to location and leave your car wherever while you shoot or do you need hike to location from a set car park/base camp area
  also whats the best way to set up a trip to central china to get pictures of the rivers and mountains there
  if someone stole my pictures i would be flattered would mean im a real photographer and my photos are worth stealing  that doesnt mean i wouldnt consider trying make money out of it probably by asking the guy to buy a licence from me or dmca report im too poor to sue someone and probably not worth the hassle  its not i loose the original of someone makes a copy and its not like i loose money from it unlike hollywood has taught some people to believe  i still have the raw so i can always prove its my photo in any case    but eitherway its a nonissue because there are many many many many photos on the internet much better than my photos so the likelyhood someone selects one of mine is near to null
  its not like i loose money from it unlike hollywood has taught some people to believe  you do lose money from it clearly they wanted your product but instead of your making x you made 0 which is a loss of x dollars
  yes but they can just use another one of billions of photos the fact that mine would have been selected is more due to luck than anything else and laziness of them for not finding something better and buying the rights for it    so lets say if someone printed a book with one of my photos and they were already in production literally being cheaper for them to buy my photo than to reprint all the books then would make sense to take action and convince them to buy a licence but if said book wasnt in production yet contacting the author could possibly result in the author choosing to just not use my photo    if a photo is being used as part of a digital product such as a website then the author can just choose to remove offending image thus no money to gain anyway    so basically what i mean is that either if my photos are used without consent or not used at all the result is the same for me profit wise
  well general question how to shoot in a dark recently ive got canon 650d 1855 35f kit and thanks to my work i cant find time to shoot midday should i by faster lenses tripod case iso is tripping noise and i need practice ty
  depends on what your actually want to shoot  also that lens is known dogshit so you should get another lens regardless
  if capturing motion doesnt matter to you then id definitely say get a tripod before anything else
i wanna get cheap boys real fuckin cheap  can i get a digital mirrorless  a decent lens for under 150
  i dunno maybe if its broken or something
  im looking to get started with interior photography but i dont know where to begin not in terms of gear but building a portfolio  same way you build a portfolio in any other genre literally just start  shoot freebies til you get people contacting you passively you wont score worthwhile paid work without a portfolio    i started interiors with urbex locations then literally shot shopping centres and museums doing this competently and creating a couple of visually stunning images a couple of times is enough to get good paid work which sooner or later turns into additional portfolio entries over time    there are also city open days in my country where private buildings tend to go open to the public for a couple of days look out for those that said theres no drawback to simply phoning emailing and best of all walking in and talking to building owners and showing them some of your exteriors and giving them a blurb like you wrote      golden rule and something i wish someone had told me when buying first camera is save up and spend as much as you possibly can as youre going to outgrow the camera body fast also budget at least 13 for body to lenses as those are what matter more once youre proficient      you  in case youre actually serious the answer is that i dont make enough from prints to make it worth worrying about and the few times people have posted my stuff online without pointing back to me ive seen literally no difference in the amount of money being made from stuff watermarking is retarded for the same reason it doesnt affect your income      best question in here      clearly they wanted your product but instead of your making x you made 0 which is a loss of x dollars  if theyre willing to print a 1080px image instead of paying a few bucks then im not losing money because theyre too mentally or visually handicapped to buy my prints anyway
  they are taking credit for your hard work other people think its theirs and they get popular and youre basically just feeding their fame youre basically a photo cuck
  why do you think it has to be busted
  how to shoot in a dark  depends what youre shooting but some things to note  tripod  longer exposure  wider aperture  higher iso  faster lens  will all help at night time beyond that youll have to add light or get a better sensor  i cant find time to shoot midday  get up earlier  should i by faster lenses tripod  both tripod being the priority      can i get a digital mirrorless  a decent lens for under 150  you can probably get a shit digital mirrorless and a shit lens for 150 but youd be better served saving ebay will answer that question for you      if youd rather spend time feeling like a cuck and complaining online than being a photographer then youre not going to be losing money
  shit mirrorless  how does this exist ive heard that the past 10 years of sensors are just as good as the others overall if i get something that can shoot 1080p  60fps hows that going to really affect me in terms of performance  more importantly will i be able to use whatever cheapest possible lens i find on any camera through black magic fuckery or is this just dreaming
  because thats not enough money for a decent camera and i can only picture somebody selling a decent camera for that much if something was wrong with it
  they are only doing those things if you are posting pictures that anybody would care about to begin with
  definitely get a faster lens that will help you immensely the canon 50/18 stm is relatively cheap and fast although a tight field of view yongnuo makes a 35/20 for about the same price thats got shittt autofocus but is optically fine     also dont be afraid to just let a photo be dark if its taken somewhere dark dial your ev compensation down a bit and look for subjects that do have a bit of light on them       that lens is known dogshit  canon kit lenses have actually been pretty good since the 1855 is theyre not great in low light although wide  stabilization is a winning combo for low light shooting of relatively still subjects even if it is only f/35 but theyre not dogshit
  the past 10 years of sensors are just as good as the others  mirrorless crop sensors didnt exist 10 years ago  if i get something that can shoot 1080p  60fps hows that going to really affect me in terms of performance  if thats what you want its completely doable early sonys are probably around there nex might fall under 150 with a garbage or broken lens  alternatively you could use a cheap vintage lens but youd need to pay another 100 for the adaptor alone  again ebay will answer this question for you
  why are those lenses garbage in your experience  id rather buy localused over ebay is a shitshow  whats the difference between modern lenses and used highend lenses from 20 years ago
  digital mirrorless under 150  yes with some compromises     1 the camera body will be kind of shitty       heres a list of mirrorless cameras for sale used on the site where i buy my used gear several are under a hundred bucks theyre old and theyre lowend but theyre still usable cameras     2 if you want a good lens itll have to be manual focus         heres kehs listings for prime lenses sorted by cost try to find something bgn or above and as wide as possible that fits into your budget 28mm would be good    3 whatever the mount is for the lens from 2 find yourself an adapter mirrorless is convenient because you can get cheap adapters for just about any manual focus film camera mount usually for twenty bucks or less    camera 100  lens 20ish  adapter 20ish  memory card 10ish    there you go
  100 for an adapter to use a vintage lens  what the fuck kind of goldplated adapters are you buying assuming youre not going for a speed booster or autofocus compatibility theyre like 1020
  name brand adapters are usually that much or more but youre right theres no reason not to go for the cheaper ones as far as i can tell
  why not upload low res photos online what are they gonna do if they steal it anyway sell 5 prints     although the following doesnt directly resort your issue there are far better photographers that share images online without watermarks etc
  its less about money and more about recognition imagine standing in the cold for hours freezing to get that perfect shot its a passion for us we enjoy it and then someone comes along and right clicks and saves it and pretends its theirs comes up with a story and hundreds of people like it and give him credit for it and we get fuck all
  at that point you can legally sue or just ask him to take it down literally happens all the time imagine trying to protect yourself from capitalism in 2018
  youre very naive
  you must really think rather highly of yourself its not a bad thing anon but tone it down a little
  how does pointing out that youre naive mean that i think too highly of myself
my brother needs me to take his picture for his yearbook but ive been told it needs to be 300 dpi iirc however taking a picture with my dslr and uploading it to my computer it says the image is 72 dpi     is this a setting in the camera that needs to be changed or something
  heh dpi depends on print size its literally dot per inch a digital image doesnt have a dpi until printed or displayed in a screen ppi pixels per inch
  ive offered you foolproof solutions to your issue and to stop you from going into the pit hole of thought that suggests everyone is out to steal your photos and theres nothing you can do about it regardless of whether you choose to share your photos now if you dont think its retarded to not share images purely because of copyright makes you thus

  yeah the 1855 stm for example is cheap and slow but itll produce some nice images with enough light useful focal range too
something seems very off   i am just learning to use a camera i think it is out of focus and also maybe lighting is off i had a lot of issues with it and had to adjust the shutter speed and white balance any advice i want to do some photos of a person sitting here but maybe it will be too much   i have a canon 450d and the lens is broken so can only be focused manually or i have a portrait lens
  just buy a bottle of fixer man only 60 for 5 liters in australia probably cheaper elsewhere check around on ebay for some deals    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makefuji photo film co ltdcamera modelsp3000camera softwareadobe photoshop cc macintoshimagespecific propertiesimage width3637image height2433number of bits per component8 8 8pixel compositionrgbimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage created20181013 164819color space informationsrgbimage width1000image height681
  i really want to get into astrophotography but usually i love photographing nature and architecture whats a good camera for beginners for around 4500 bucks
how do i become less lazy and get away from just shooting in auto mode and more than that i need to pay more attention to the photos that i take because after a trip i find that half of them are terribly overexposed and unsalvagable

      thank you for answers ive got a tripod already want to go for niftyfifty but crop factor makes it 80 mm this is what bothers me the most also found 35 f2 for 200  get up earlier  i go to work at 7 am sunrise at 843 welp
hello zoomers  fuck this all this bloomer optimism in color take the doomerpill and shoot bw only just dont listen to these bloomers and boomers     now daido moriyama is your god
  shoot aperture priority
  as a general rule bigger sensor  gathers more light  better for astro  but whats probably more important is the lens needs to be faster lower fstop so that it can gather more light
  as a general rule bigger sensor  gathers more light  not againyoure wrong and stop spreading this bullshit
  agreed this can be a great way to grow beyond shooting only in auto easy to isolate and see first hand the effects different aperture settings have while still having the camera do the heavy lifting

im going to a runway in a few hours i dont have a lot of experience and i just have two lens  55200/56  1855/3556  which should i take with me
  both
  which should i use and why thank you btw
does a faster lens also help with contrastdetecting af    why does the af on my nex5n always fucking avoid eyes and shit i cant get anything decent on auto because of this and even on manual i have to fuck with manual focus constantly
  addendum does af assume youre going to frame the subject in the center most times i feel like my ruleofthirds shots are almost always fucked because of this
  i thought this was absolutely correct several other things like sensor generation being equal
  if he meant total light yes but he was talking about exposure ie better for astro which is independent of sensor size

not really photography related but hoping this thread can help people    i might start shooting video with my iphone i bought a dedicated mic and stand with tripod to shoot some street scenes is video on iphone legitimate if interested on my set up let me know/
  no
  google movies shot on iphones its better than i expected but idk what kind of post processing went into it   
  yes look into filmora
  for the price of an iphone you can buy a nice camera and a some fast russian radioactive prime lens  also dont record audio in camera use an external recorder if you want to record audio taskam has some good affordable recorders they say
  oh and take notice that there are different kinds of microphones such as unidirectional cardioid etc read up on that and choose whats best for you
  for the price of an iphone you can buy a nice camera   he already owns the iphone no one buys an iphone just for the camera parts     people asking this sort of question almost all already own a smartphone or are planning to buy one mainly for smartphone type things and the camera on it is a secondary concern    stop repeating this cameras are cheaper than high end phones meme because it makes you look like an idiot it would be a ike someone asking about whether a certain type of car has a good heater and responding that a space heater from wal mart is cheaper yes its true but youre completely misunderstanding the reality of the situation in a way that makes you sound like either a complete moron or a troll
    no one buys an iphone at all lol everybody just gets it on a plan
  iphone     really cant take you serious you know
  i am aware that he already owns the damn iphone the point is that if he can afford an iphone he can also afford a camera if he doesnt be can still sell the damn iphone and buy a much cheaper android phone that does everything an iphone does and even more and still have money for a camera lens microphone recorder and tripod      no one buys an iphone at all lol everybody just gets it on a plan  if you get a phone on a plan you effectively buy the phone the price is included in plan itself dah isps dont give out iphones for free lol  and its obviously much cheaper to buy a normal phone and a cheap or prepaid plan than getting a plan that includes a highend smartphone on it    because again no one needs a highend phone they dont do anything an entry level phone cant do they are a luxury item for people who dont have anything better to do with their money thus if they cant afford a camera the logical choice is to sell the unnecessary item so they can buy the useful item they require
  isps dont give out iphones for free lol  isps dont give out iphones at all mobile carriers do
  they are the same company so who cares at least here  arguing over semantics  and no they dont they dont give iphones for free thats not how busyness works
  yeah i dont get why anyone would buy an iphone when there are cheaper android phones out there its just like all of those idiots buying coca cola when sams choice is the same color has the same carbonation and costs way less per can and anyone buying name brand toilet paper is a foolthe cheap stuff also scrapes away shit and you can just wash the shit off of your hand if your finger pokes through and jesus dont even get me started on people who buy name brand clothingive never tried any of the big brands because theyre all so clearly overpriced when you can get the exact same number of arm and leg holes from a burlap sack with holes cut in it if youre not some stupid fucking hipster idiot whos obsessed with fashion     you and me man were the only smart people in this thread

lets delve into the more subjective philosophical opinions for a moment    on what basis/justification do you keep/take/edit/share/cull photos the way you do    to be more elaborately specific and yes this question can apply to a broader perspective on why one lives their life the way they do but in regards to photos what are the reasons that make you delete an image or store it or keep it regardless or cull it due to a factor    the reason i ask is because nowadays one tends to take and share and keep photos across many platforms and apps and eventually duplicates/modified spinoff duplicates come about  personally i keep the subjectively sometimes objective factors too like resolution best image in a crowd of similar duplicates and delete the rest but applying this logic to old photos i took as a kid breaks down because you cant really go back and make such photos again sure i dont really care for the crappy pics i took of my crappy lego builds but they are irreplaceable originals    or even something benign as the edit you make to post on social media its usually cropped downsized and color filtered but is it worth keeping a local copy of the edit or just the original unless you write down the exact steps you took its just as difficult to exactly recreate an edit a few years down the line  some will argue against senseless clutter others will argue there isnt such thing as clutter in an age where digital storage local and cloud is laughably cheap    im sure everyone has their own opinions/reasons/justifications for why they keep/cull the images they do and id like to hear them    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cs4 macintoshimagespecific propertiesimage width5045image height4009compression schemeuncompressedpixel compositionunknownimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage created20100209 214504color space informationuncalibratedimage width650image height513
i used to hoard copious amounts of originals it is great when you go back to them after a year of getting better at editing and reedit the originals with a new look truth is i go back to reediting very very rarely and i end up editing my newly taken shots and keep on hoarding old ones so i just gave myself a break from taking new shots for some months and just reedited whatever i had left otherwise i was literally hoarding everything    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesphotographercosmicgiggleimagespecific properties
  i keep everything in the age of digital and with storage getting cheaper and cheaper why would you ever delete anything if you were to delete anything it would be the exported jpg never the original    i organize my photos like this    all of my originals from my photo trips go in a folder subdivided by day    i then make one extra folder for the exported jpgs called finals    any images i want for social media i have a separate folder with the downsized versions its unlikely i will ever use those images again after posting but theyre out of the way so i dont care to delete them    in terms of what i decide to share or keep to myself its just simply my personal standards that i try to keep myself to
currently it seems prudent to rename every photo one takes with the timestamp img_yyyymmdd_hhmmss    24 hour time and if multiple shots were taken a second then a further _ to order their sequence  obviously if you got multiple people taking shots and pool them together its better to keep each persons pool of images seperate but the naming convention should stick  i name folders with yyyymmdd  camera model  title topic of folder    makes indexing much easier if i take photos across multiple days for the same topic/shoot i may bend the convention and use a yyyymmdddd to show it went for a few days like a festival or holiday      while bulk rename utility often does the heavy lifting for images that have correct timestamp metadata already its a bitch for old photos that had wrong dates/times on the devices or film photos since you have to either estimate ask your folks if they remember when or pull out the old album and hope someone wrote down more than just a year    that last point brings me to an interesting qualm since they are the ones you need organized and archived most of all but were treated the shoddiest

  fuck manufacturers who use mchanical linkage in the year of our lord 2018
   buy xt3 is best camera much better then foolframe
  fuck no this is a nice thread for people to be happy about their purchases
okay so i am a long time canon guy but i like to keep an open mind so ive bought a lot of other brands over the years and keep coming back to canon as my main system my most recent purchase was a sony a7m2 since those have plummeted in price with the release of the a7m3    and can i just say what the fuck why do people like this camera so much how can people possibly say this is better than canon the autofocus at least with the sony fe 50/18 i bought to go with it is slow as fuuuuck theres not a way to directly select an af point without switching to af point select mode which granted theres a million buttons i can remap to but its still ass compared to the dedicated joystick on my canon the af point doesnt track with the cameras orientation so if you turn the camera sideways youll have to change up your af point eyedetect is nice but i havent yet figured out a way to switch it on and off efficiently for those times when i dont want to focus on a face startup lag is measured in seconds rather than being too short to perceive the dials are really not comfortable to access you cant set a minimum shutter speed in aperture priority mode    this is what the fourth model in the a7 line and sony had been making cameras for years before the a7 this stuff is all really lowhanging fruit that has been around on other cameras for years    some nice things so far wifi/nfc which newer canons have too i believe eyedetect focus when it works ibis infinder image review flippy screen
nikon d500 and fujifilm xt3 just made full frame obsolete the quality is superb for the price     you should consider full frame if you have m43 if you have apsc you should consider mf
  the af point doesnt track with the cameras orientation so if you turn the camera sideways youll have to change up your af point    does the a7 ii not have swt v/h af area    eyedetect is nice but i havent yet figured out a way to switch it on and off efficiently for those times when i dont want to focus on a face     assign it to a button i have it mapped to afon on my a7 iii
  does the a7 ii not have swt v/h af area  nope looks like they didnt add that until the a9/a7riii
  can we also shill our own work it would be nice to have a thread where we can do that shamelessly without being harassed
    thats literally what this board was created for
  i have owned and/or extensively used an rx100 a7ii a7iii canon eos r nikon d3200 canon 6d and 80d i hope you have updated the firmwares to the current version because that usually fixes some of your issues    the autofocus sony fe 50/18 is slow as fuuuuck  because you literally bought the slowest lens they produce if you had done any research at all you would know that the 50 18 is slow before buying it if you want a fast 50 you get the 55 zeiss    theres not a way to directly select an af point without switching to af point select mode  put it on the circle button in the middle of the dpad to activate and then use the dpad to move around or just use the selective spot modes again use a custom button to activate its about the same as a joystick not much worse    the af point doesnt track with the cameras orientation  use d pad to move point around better yet use afc because its 99 accurate you dont use these cameras like you use a dslr the camera is smart enough to find the right focus point and fast enough that if it doesnt you can move the camera to focus on what youre looking for and itll lock on no need to constantly reposition yourself like a dslr    eyedetect is nice but i havent yet figured out a way to switch it on and off  set it to your ael button or similar  eye detect wont turn on unless you hold the button then    startup lag is measured in seconds rather than being too short to perceive  if this is true your camera has something extremely wrong with it and you should return it immediately my a7ii started up faster than i could raise it to my eye    you cant set a minimum shutter speed in aperture priority mode  youre in aperture mode just shoot manual if you want to adjust both not hard to figure out    it sounds like more than anything you need to read your manuals learn the menus and set up your camera the way you want it and learn how to use a mirrorless camera because its not a dslr
  because you literally bought the slowest lens they produce  its not just the af motor speed its that it has to focus in then out a little then in again like its doing contrastdetect only autofocus instead of phasedetect     if you had done any research at all you would know that the 50 18 is slow before buying it  i was just assuming that a 250 lens designed for a camera with phasedetect autofocus would be reasonably quick at doing phasedetect autofocus like ill admit that i didnt do any research on it but i feel like usable autofocus speed isnt that much to ask for especially when it costs nearly twice as much as canons 50/18 that autofocuses fine    oh you actually wanted to autofocus your autofocus lens shouldve bought the 1000 version instead of the 250 version does not help the argument that sony isnt kinda shitty     put it on the circle button in the middle of the dpad to activate  i did that its still two extra buttons i have to press because for some reason it ignores the first dpad button after hitting the center button every single time i change my af point changing my af point is probably the control i use on my cameras more than anything other than the shutter button itself     just shoot manual if you want to adjust both not hard to figure out  ah but heres the thing i dont want to adjust both i want to set my aperture i want the shutter speed to float down to a minimum speed and then i want autoiso to take over     so for instance i want to be able to say f/4 and a minimum of 1/125th but if i move somewhere with more light it should feel free to go above 1/125th when it gets down to iso 100
  you cant set a minimum shutter speed in aperture priority mode  whats the scenario that youd want this     you do have the option of setting a minimum shutter speed when using auto iso via iso auto min ss i know some sports shooters that like this option when the lighting is good
   iso auto min ss  i dont think the a7ii has that unless im just missing it somewhere in the menus

  oh and heres another a7ii issue     i would like to be able to use the viewfinder most of the time and occasionally the lcd ideal would be for it to act like a dslr where i can assign one of the 27 function buttons to turn on the rear lcd and otherwise it would just use the viewfinder     id be fine with just using the auto lcd/evf switching if it would fucking work but no the sensor that turns off the rear lcd is shit and turns off the screen if a shadow falls over it for instance if the shadow of the viewfinder itself falls over it i was just out on a sunny day trying to frame a shot and the rear lcd wouldnt stay on for framing at waist level and the only way to do it was a dive into the menu system to turn off the rear lcd entirely and then because sony is brilliant to undo that afterwards i have to go into the menus again but this time while looking at the menus through a tiny electronic viewfinder it would have been so easy for them to get this right and they just totally whiffed it and went with the worst possible design at every opportunity four major firmware revisions plus the other three members of the a7 line before it to tell them that this is a crappy design and its not fixed
  its not just the af motor speed its that it has to focus in then out a little then in again like its doing contrastdetect only autofocus instead of phasedetect    the lens is seriously that slow its totally acceptable for slow shooting or stationary subjects but its slow as fuck    i was just assuming that a 250 lens designed for a camera with phasedetect autofocus would be reasonably quick at doing phasedetect autofocus like ill admit that i didnt do any research on it but i feel like usable autofocus speed isnt that much to ask for especially when it costs nearly twice as much as canons 50/18 that autofocuses fine    you assumed wrong i agree it shouldnt be 250 and most other people do too to be fair its regularly on sale for 198 but even that is too high given the slow performance its a little better on the higher models but its still slow then again if you buy into the sony system you already know through your research that youre stuck buying hella expensive lenses its kind of a sony tax kinda like apple if you cant stomach it you dont buy sony it doesnt make sony or apple for that matter shitty in fact their products are extremely good but yes they cost a lot of money     changing my af point is probably the control i use on my cameras more than anything other than the shutter button itself    biggest advice here is to seriously use afc and learn to operate the mirrorless camera in a different fashion than a dslr using my sonys for me is the opposite i use afc almost exclusively with slight adjustments if needed to get the focal point  spot focusing is archaic in the mirrorless world and i use it probably like 1 of the time
  my a7ii never had this issue the a7iii has ability to set lock on evf or lock on screen only cant remember if a7ii has it     it sounds like your camera is severely secondhand busted or you just got a weird / bad copy or you need to watch your hands more than you realize because youre blocking the sensor     ideal would be for it to act like a dslr     this thought process is why youre so frustrated you want a dslr so go use a dslr dont buy a mirrorless camera and expect it to be a dslr     that would be like me buying a banjo and being angry that it doesnt sound like an electric guitar
  the a7iii has ability to set lock on evf or lock on screen only  which is nice when using a gimbal
    biggest advice here is to seriously use afc and learn to operate the mirrorless camera in a different fashion than a dslr  i often get that peoples issues are often due to old habits the 2009/10 canon 7d was already reliable in continuous tracking where single point could be set to afon for the rare occasions of unreliable tracking nikon was there even earlier still people use 5d4 cameras in afs with only the center af point this drives me nuts
  biggest advice here is to seriously use afc and learn to operate the mirrorless camera in a different fashion than a dslr  i am attempting to take this advice     some more complaints   1 holy shit the battery life sucks on this thing to the point that im wondering if i got a bad battery since my other mirrorless bodies including my a6000 are a lot better my other three sonies all use the same battery props to sony for that at least so i might try swapping one of those in and see if it improves   2 memory modes dont work as well as on the 5d3

  ill probably try to shill in a /vid/ thread as well    i am currently trying to build a youtube channel around vid work i was inspired recently by a fucking shit video essay i watched called joaquin phoenix keeps rising by fandor i was so tired of all these fluff piece video essays so i made a video satirizing it and plan to move in that direction though i currently cant figure out how to shill my channel without being a little bitch     video 
holy shit i just got the sigma mc11 in the mail and my canon ef 50/18 stm focuses better on my a7 ii than my sony 50/18 does    what the fuck sony    also nice fucking work sigma
  cant wait for mine to come wednesday gonna go rent some long canon telephotos for my a7 iii ill report back with results
i feel that the shilling has gone down since this thread has been here
  what the fuck sony    the 50/18 is flawed the motor is underpowered and not accurate it is the flat out slowest lens sony makes lagging behind screw drive lenses even    if you were to try the 55/18 itd beat the mc11 by a tad    that said the mc11 is a solid adapter i use mine with the canon 40/28
  if you were to try the 55/18 itd beat the mc11 by a tad  at 950 for a nifty goddamn fiftyfive id fucking hope so
    it is probably one of the better 50 lenses ever made    but yea i havent picked one up yet either way too pricey they seriously need more budget emount lenses
i fucking hate street photography its such a disgusting thing  seriously shooting random people often homeless without their fucking consent is absolutely disgusting

  shut the fuck up boomer
everyone has a street phase
  illegally  found your problem  youre a fuckwit
  because street photography is about taking shots on streets hence the name if what you want to do is take pictures of architecture then thats something different street photography is all about the candid experience
  i dont know about elsewhere but its actually illegal here in germany to take pictures of strangers some get away with it of course but in recent years theyve started cracking down on it quite hard you need to have permission of the person youre photographing to be in the clear
  thats retarded youre in the public view you shouldnt expect privacy
  and there goes journalism nice knowing you democratic germany its been a fun 70 years
  street photography is all about the candid experience  literally glorified snapshitting

  they dont want abdul umbongo chimping out and going on a rape spree after he thinks youve stolen his soul    it can be good when it crosses into other genres such as fashion or war but modern street photography is so played out and awful if theres a homeless person as the subject i wish nothing but death upon the photographer
  highway overpass  architecture     lmao
  illegal here in germany to take pictures of strangers  fucking bullshit we have a street tripfag from germany       based       good shit my nigger
    
  we already had the argument about this in another thread with another idiotic law obsessed kraut     basically as long as you strip the exif off your photos or shoot film theres no issue the law pertains to data collection such as where someone was at a certain time the exif would technically count as data collection on an individual due to the time stamp and possible gps data if theres no exif or the photo is analogue then you dont need consent from the subject as no data is collected about date/time/location and so it isnt illegal in the slightest as the law is currently we literally had a 300 reply thread about this and the kraut conceded defeat    theres a few interesting articles about the law causing a boom in analog street photography in germany its cool it isnt illegal its just a broad scare tactic like most german law where they get off on being governed in chains
is there anything about photography that you do like  why not talk about that instead
  feels good to be a filmfag
  i think its the same krautfag   good to know therere still sane anons on the board     that pic related  this is really really really sad lmao wtf
  not only that but if someone was offended that they were a subject in one of your photos say uploaded to facebook the law requires that they have to go and file a ceasedesist notice through a law firm to action its removal so unless its really worth the money and time to remove one photo from the internet to them they most likely wont bother     at most youll be asked to remove or delete the photo which happens to street photographers every day worldwide and isnt a huge deal
  what in the actual fuck is that thing
  a twitch mod at twitchcon they had a panel on effective moderation
  she mogged 70 of /fit/     aare those bobs normal
  just the tight corset squashing her pecs into tits i think trannes gonna tranny
  i mean  i see how this is bait and cringe but i actually kinda agree i feel like people are not that considerate
  not all of us are weird autistic creeps like chosis i do street photography mainly and ive never had a serious issue with people because i dont run around in cum splattered clothes with a greasy bowlcut i dress well i shower if people ask what im doing i have a conversation with them about it appearances and attitude matter its unfair to say street photographers should stop because a handful of assholes use it as a convenient excuse to harass people
  based
batch send photos from wifi configured camera to phone at regular intervals  delete ones with identifiable faces keep nondescript ones on camera  looks like im dicking around on camera and phone like every other person  pretend to ignore and be hyperautistic/talking to myself if someone interrupts this process to stall for time  nno officer i dont keep many photos the voices tell me which ones to keep  works every time
  this post  is totally false the gdpr applies to analog photography or photos without exif data just as well the gdpr applies to anything with a data system no matter if analog like sheets of paper or digital like files on a computer  as long as persons like eg family members can identify you even because only of your clothes it needs consent  you could also argue that a film is a data system on its own since it sorts the pictures from 1x in the shot order    its like those idiotic reichbürger putting their license plate upside down because the law doesnt state it nor forbids it yet neglect the fact that it has to be clearly visible and readable which means of course in a normal orientation
  oh not to forget that in germany photographing someone without constent also can offend a persons personal rights its not only the gdpr    there are enough people ok with you taking their pictures why harrass those who dont
street is shit 9999 of the time
  have you ever been harassed by someone like someone gave you shit for taking their picture
street is a genre for white suburbanites who have just moved out of their zoo phase
yeah i had some old fuck taking photos of me while i was practising on a piano really quietly annoyed me that once he spotted me he ran away like dude knew he was doing something wrong
    sounds like he wasnt a street photographer    the real artists stand on a street corner on a busy intersection and dont even try to hide
  he was with his wife so idk what he was doing
  germany france netherlands  iirc the only places in the world that have portrait rights one of the stupidest and most inherently oppressive pieces of legislation ever  research why it was instated dead german chancellor note that it has no value whatsoever and just encourages assholes to be bigger assholes while allowing big brother to keep us arguing and not focused on their stupidity  fuck off with your illegal suck my dick with your implied immoral and eat shit with your privacy in public

  all the time  then youre not a photographer youre someone with a camera and no sense of personal space unless youre bruce gilden or some ultra rare exception then being a street photographer is exclusively easier and better when you learn not to piss anyone off  i went through a wide angle phase and still was only asked not to shoot someone once or twice over thousands of people and if anyone with any intent of being a professional photographer ran into confrontation more than once id tell them theyd already fucked up youre either not a professional photographer or youre purposefully baiting and being edgy
  very bad shot

  this    unless you live in africa or some shit wildlife is boring as hell and its satisfying catching people doing ordinary things in interesting ways   for example this shot i took yesterday just a random shot of two korean tourists lost here in japan composition isnt good nor the framing but tells a story which i found interesting at the time    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce6000camera softwareilce6000 v320maximum lens aperturef/50focal length 35mm equiv51 mmimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution350 dpivertical resolution350 dpiimage created20181104 205316exposure time1/250 secfnumberf/56exposure programmanualiso speed rating5000brightness27 evexposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length3400 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width6000image height3376renderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal

  see i just couldnt give a shit about 2 random ass chinks who get lost theres like a billion of those fuckers i could walk around my local mall and get like 40 shots of people looking lost humand are boring af wildlife takes skill and patience and is super rewarding when you get a great shot street photography is for brainlets and creeps
  thats manchester not london
  riddle me this why dont you ever see wildlife shots in galleries
i enjoy street photography although sometimes its annoying having to wait for people to move out of the frame
  maybe because wildlife togs are out in a camoflaged tents off the beaten path while street togs are whoring themselves to curators who havent seen the back side of a camera since the art school in the 70s
  riddle me this why are the most famous and well known photographers either take street photos portraits or is a photojournalist
   its actually illegal here in germany  germany is the one country where anything you could possibly do is either illegal or compulsory most of the rest of the world is different
            stop evading your fucking ban and samefagging no one likes your shit and no one will follow your insta
  i shoot street here in the netherlands portrait right only applies to publishing there is no crime at point of photographing  not like anyone is ever going to extort you with this unless its some rich fag
      makes sense now i saw two other obviously antagonistic bait threads with the usual zoomer boomer and other /pol/ nonsense buzzwords before replying here which follow his formula by this stage its fairly evident he has a mental illness    its a shame too because /p/ has been sprouting with photo threads as of late and even the gearfagging has been mostly isolated and quiet
  whats the difference between a fatty stuffing their face with mcdonalds walking down main street and a bear eating a salmon in a river    not much bud
  riddle me this why dont you ever see wildlife shots in galleries  you do    maybe because wildlife togs are out in a camoflaged tents off the beaten path while street togs are whoring themselves to curators who havent seen the back side of a camera since the art school in the 70s  both of those genres of photography are heavily pushed street less so because its less interesting and has less barrier to entry    riddle me this why are the most famous and well known photographers either take street photos portraits or is a photojournalist  they arent even historically the big names are mostly landscape and other genres its only on /p/ and other beginner groups facebook etc where the audience is almost all new photographers that street photography is held in high regard and some of the old film guys are thrown about outside of those cartierbresson is the only guy who even gets a mention    if you guys are going to have a retarded argument at least get your retarded facts right
  looks like a chosis shot  nah it would be much worse if it was another tell is that the image itself is telling the story instead of a longwinded and horribly written pseudodeep paragraph posted next to it
    searches famous photographers on google   first 12 results are all either photojournalists street or fashion only 1 landscape tog ansel adams  my point was those togs all have something in common with their work it always involves humanity humanity is more personal you cant draw an emotional connection to some random deer you saw in the wild wildlife photography is no more enjoyable to look at than a taxidermy deer head on your wall sure you tracked it down for ages using up all your strength to muster up the final kill shot but to someone who wasnt for all that its just a deer head on a wall nothing else photojournalism on the other hand is literally the documentary of us as a species i find it unfair to compare each since theyre both very different types of photography

  seems to be playing the troll did the same thing on /p/ and instagram when he was outed as a pedo and scammer by saying he was an angry friend who had hijacked chosis account and was pretending to be a scammer and pedo all this time  it reminds me of that i was only pretending to be retarded jpeg  it also explains why he haunts places with anonymous posting im consistently surprised hes never been arrested or institutionalised but i suppose being a retard online is harmless in the grand scheme of things and despite the creepy shit he isnt worth tracking down    anyway sage to the rescue
  lol at these people in the b roll laughing at/being disgusted by chosis
  yeah he thinks hes being funny leaving that post up like it explains months of him being legitimately creepy on that account and others some of his posts were in depth reviews for deep web cp sites others he says a friend of mine is into children what do i do seems he has a lot of friends who find children attractive hes really talking about himself        heres one from another of his throwaways where he does the same thing also his absolutely crusty battlestation from the same account      i found all this because he samefags as hard on reddit as he does here hell jump in with sock accounts to defend himself against any form of criticism
  not to mention he goes to high schools to find underage girls to model for him
    im so done wtf even is this
  no idea
  amazing someone should collect and post a repository of this stuff somewhere encyclopedia dramatica would be a good place if it werent for the fact there are countless pages of data and history for his pedo stuff and failed scams he really is an amazing example of a particularly creepy nutjob to name but a few interesting points    pretended to have bone cancer to get views and likes on /p/ and instagram  pretended to be various things to solicit bitcoin donations  attempted to scam /biz/ and /p/ multiple times  actively stalks underage girls  gets into confrontations on the streets regularly for creepshots  pretended to be someone he had an argument with on /p/ and made death threats with a gun against himself and called for internet vigilantism presumably to get them banned or arrested  invasively shoots at crime and accident scenes crying bruce gilden as a defense  pretended to be a childhood friend who hacked an account after being outed as a pedo on instagram  routinely talks about his cp escapades on reddit and cites trolling when outed    and im only referencing stuff ive actively seen and thats come to mind i dont even keep tabs on the guy cause im sure therere others i dont know about    again fairly amazed he hasnt been arrested or sanctioned
    its actually allowed as long as its artistic  
  how fucking dull would that be
  how fucking dull  just about anything can make a good subject for photography if youre a good enough photographer

  i make sure to sage all of my posts about him if you dont like it go shitpost in the other dozen street photography threads made per week
  as long as you are not telling someone to walk there its not staging its like finding the perfect framing in wildlife and waiting for the lion to walk by what you described is not staging its called laying in wait some do that others hunt for their shots
  am i not staging the photo  waiting a longer time for the decisive moment to happen is not staging a photo no

  japan is cheating    its also painfully unoriginal when everyone does the same color grading
  i like this good composition and subject a photo with some story to it    i personally am just not interested in being the one behind the lens when it comes to street photography shooting wildlife or landscapes i feel like a witness but i dont have any desire to be the person to take this shot im mostly imagining what its like to be an upset teenager fighting with her mother and have someone snap a photo

whether you think street photography is an invasion of privacy cliche staged or boring people everywhere need to understand that public photography is legal if you get your picture taken while out taking a walk there is no logical reason to lose your temper if there is reason you do not desire your photo to be taken just calmly ask the photographer to delete it/not develop it simple as that     i have street photographer friends who are really just our there to capture unique looking people/fashion/human beings kinda like fishing and just seeing what they can catch if you think street photographers are scum chill out theyre not paparazzi
so friend of mine asked me to be one of three critics for amateur photography competition so far there are about 20 entries contestants are between 17  25 year old some of them are pretty bad and im kind of stuck on how to keep the feedback / critique positive and most importantly constructive even though the picture is mobile snap in absolutely horrid quality how do you provide constructive criticism on something thats probably not even worth of criticising it       now there are some pictures that are easily judged and you can give straight feedback like you are focusing your portrait on the nose instead of the eyes of the model and it makes it look little bit weird with such shallow depth of field or think this landscape doesnt look so well in sharp afternoon light maybe you should wait for golden hour to give it more warm and welcoming feel since you talk about it in the comment but what am i supposed to say when i get a snapshot of some thrash someone found in an old abandonned building took a pic from eye level and decided that it will look artsy if its in black  white i feel like saying this is not properly exposed and out of focus you make zero effort to tell a story and paid zero attention to setting up the scene use of black and white on this picture is unjustified and to be honest it does more harm than it helps in terms of overall look plus it doesnt fit the theme at all   of course i can probably suggest them solution for each problem ive mentioned but given the giant ammount of mistakes it gives me a feeling that i sound like an arogant and entitled prick who picks on everything they do i also want to be encouraging to these people since they actually have balls to share their content with other people and dont want to put them off photography for good    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cc macintoshimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage created20150316 084027color space informationuncalibratedimage width500image height330
little bit of background  im supposed to judge based on form technical prowess content whats in the picture and relation to the theme of the competition i have to make written comment about the work and the contestants will have opportunity to talk to me at the event heres my framework for critique     intent  can the viewer look at the photo and see what the photographer had in mind     emotional impact  does the photo make an emotional statement is there a visible emotion it depicts in terms of atmosphere and storytelling     center of interest  is the image sucessfully directing the viewer to the center of interest using composition techniques     illusion of depth  are there any art concepts like framing balance contrast etc implemented that help the image spring to life / jump off the page is it more static or is there effort to tell a story    subject / background contrast  does the subject stand out in the scene or is it blending with its background how well is it done and is it intentional     composition  is there consistent use of rules such as rule of thirds golden triangle phi grid formal / informal balance or leading lines does the author make an effort to point the viewers eyes somewhere when they look at the image first time     selective focus  if there is a depth of field used is it effective as a way to help the viewer decide what is the subject what is the reasoning for using it is the image properly focused on the subject if the focus is elsewhere than on the subject is it intentional and does it help in terms of narative     exposure / technical prowess  is the picture well exposed if not why is it intentional is the photographer controlling the light or letting the light control him and the settings he uses      storytelling  does the image tell a story is there something left to the imagination or is it just a statement of what it is does it give the viewer a reason for second glance
  can you talk to the participants i would probably ask them why they submitted the picture then ask them if they think it could be improved then offer them your opinion in a nice non condescending manner   if you have to give a written report id probably use the points you wrote in the second post and answer in that format  also if you are a non autist you could ask the other judges what their approach is as it is the first time you are doing this and would not like to break down but to encourage the participants
  cant talk to the participants before i give out the scores they had opportunity to provide comment along with their work but most of them only wrote few words about what is on the picture bridge near my house a portrait etc    ive talked with other judges little bit before hand all three of us make a bit of money on the side with their photos but none uf us is a pro or has experience with art critique we want to write the critiques in a way it encourages the photographers to approach us at the event after they read it which is pretty hard because at least for amateurs the last thing you want to do after someone rips your work to shreds is talk to that person between four eyes
meet with judges and agree on a judge category that suits your personality the personality that got you asked to do it in the first place  basically like good cop bad cop indifferent cop mum cop  then just use those obviously stereotypical names as your judge names make a novelty of it go to the extreme of each type and it should be clear that you are all not only giving a very special kind of critique but that its not intended to be taken entirely seriously  because subjective media is subjective    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makericoh imaging company ltdcamera modelpentax k3camera softwaredarktable 207photographerandrew wade eglington ohhiinfosensing methodonechip color areafocal length 35mm equiv300 mmimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandimage created20181124 181306exposure time1/500 secfnumberf/56exposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating200exposure bias0 evmetering modepatternflashno flashfocal length20000 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width480image height720renderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrastsoftsaturationnormalsharpnesssoftsubject distance rangedistant view
be the simon judge    people also need harsh critique sometimes to remind them where the bar stands  best they learn it now while they are using their phones than later when their photogdreambubble pops after spending thousands of simoleons on gear    even the few grains of wheat are grown amongst a lot of useless chaff     you can still use that kind of critique if you want to go a little subtler but perhaps reword them to use remember one needs to or perhaps next time try  the fewer direct yous you use during creative criticism or judgement means they will feel you are trying to teach not attack
  cont    this is not properly exposed and out of focus you make zero effort to tell a story and paid zero attention to setting up the scene use of black and white on this picture is unjustified and to be honest it does more harm than it helps in terms of overall look plus it doesnt fit the theme at all    reworded would be  hmm this couldve been exposed and focused more accurately but theres also a lack of story remember to set up the scene first as if one wishes to tell the viewer something  also what spurred the choice of b/w it doesnt really do the scene justice since image colour style must fit the theme or they work against each other    pretend youre judging the image silently for a minutr while you are actually coming up with a neutrally directed constructive critique of twothree sentences you dont come off as a prick and participants walk away having learned what they personally can improve on
  great advice thanks
you can always assume they dont know much of anything about photography maybe look at it as your criticisms/critiques as a teaching lesson throw out suggestions on using rule of thirds straight horizon foreground/background shallow depth of field doesnt automatically make your photo good neither does making it bw stuff like that be nice and try to find ways to compliment the photo too otherwise they will just deem you an elitist art snob in their own minds and not take anything to heart

  underexposed oversaturated youre welcome
    ok very helpful
this one i like the least model said she loves i dont know what to think
visit /p/ for constructive criticism the said ptfff lol
you need to practice exposing properly and stop doing unnecessary stuff with curves
  try it before the sun sets value of the face is similar to grass histogram has nothing above 50 underexposed by 2 stops      flash makes the subject pop but background is too dark maybe thats your thing but try a longer shutter to expose the background some more if your camera has manual controls also those colors look weird you messed with curves      backlighting eh      background looks posterized and is lighter than the subject      understandable she has a nice profile and her hair doesnt look greasy like in the previous one shes got a dreamy expression watch out how you move the shadow slider you make her arm look quite hairy pay attention to the framing theres a bit of her leg  but not the elbow her hair should be either all in or clearly cut    /p/ is a slow board have patience if your grievance is about constructiveness feel free to try /ic/
      these are all excellent apart from the processing which is really letting them down underexposed not the flash one which is fine just a bit harsh tonally and im absolutely certain youre not correcting white balance no way should that blue cast be there   saturation suits these model is having fun definitely do more but    complete carnage in the background you really need fill flash here and watch your framing her gaze needs to go somewhere into the frame rather than straight out also a bit of wide angle distortion
  yea i dont know much about curves but it seemed fun to mess with gonna stay away from it and stick with whats naturally taken      we were there before sunset    i barely curved the color but i did indeed    what about it the backlighting is it really that bad    it wasnt posterized at least not intentionally it definitely is lighter thank you    shes got hairy arms and we discussed it and i totally agree with the framing opinion    i am ok with with you guys here at /p/ model was present and she wanted to read some input instantly        thank you once again she was having fun we took a few more but i didt feel like converting so many at the moment    i will be more careful with the framing and the exposure as well i should be reposting before the weekend    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makecanoncamera modelcanon eos1d mark iicamera softwareadobe photoshop cs51 macintoshmaximum lens aperturef/28imagespecific propertiesimage width470image height345number of bits per component8 8 8pixel compositionrgbimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage created20130314 185337exposure time1/250 secfnumberf/35exposure programmanualiso speed rating400lens aperturef/35exposure bias0 evmetering modepatternflashno flash compulsoryfocal length14800 mmcolor space informationunknownimage width470image height345renderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balanceautoscene capture typestandard

  we were there before sunset  my bad underexposure made it look like twilight i got bamboozled  i barely curved the color  look at her arm it goes from yellow to magenta and the transition aint that smooth either not sure what went wrong but it went quite wrong  what about it the backlighting  its a matter of dynamic range either you expose for the sky and the branches become silhouettes or you expose for the branches and the sky is blown out here the sky is still too bright while the branches look gray and muddy backlight is tricky  at least not intentionally  it looks like the trees have a grayblue stroke around them  shes got hairy arms  didnt mean to diss still if you bring down the blacks youll make the hair darker and more noticeable look at the area where it goes from light to shadow  dark and opaque tone  maybe try localized edits or invest in an off camera flash
    true    true    yes backlight stay tricky    i see that trees look like they are made out clay    no diss taken i totally understand but i cant undermine the obvious and yes they become a lot more noticeable as it gets blacker    off camera flash for sure you are amazing thanks

  i dont really have experience at these focal lengths so i cant really help you but im really curious about this too  looking forward to see the development and conclusion on this subject
  check the date and see where the moon was that day and if it was a full moon
  yeah pretty sure it was the night of the super moon but cant work out exactly where the shot would have been taken from so cant work out if it would be aligned
  any way to tell if its real  let me ask you this  have you ever seen a daylight picture where the sun source of illumination and the landscape reflecting the light from the source were both in the frame and both correctly exposed
  yeah its just tonemapped  read  claiming its not photoshopped and that all he did was color grading increase shadows and reduce the highlights
  just tonemapped  its not even close to possible to get the moon and a moonlit subject in a single exposure with the moon exposed as middle grey
there are some hints it is fake firstly the clouds seem to be behind the moon also the clouds seem to reflect way to less light from the moon secondly i dont see how this could have been exposured since the moon is definitely exposed with a georotating tripod but the tower is not motionblurred also the foregrund seems to be astonishingly bright for the lightness of the background furthermore the comoression does not look very fitting with a focal length like that the twigs in the near forground should merely be a dark spot and the tower seems to be too near most likely this is shot with a medium tele and the blurry small overexposed moon was replaced by a astro photo this would explain all quirks
  a good way to tell is check the details on the fences and the edge fringes yes this is the real photo
  i assumed that the tower was actually lit by some form of artificially lighting like the buildings nearby and streetlight he did say it was color graded  and idk what those modern highend cameras are really capable of so i assumed the have enough dynamic range for it      1/500 sec isnt fast enough to photograph the moon without a georotating tripod o_o
  i have to take back my original statement i made a noise pattern analysis and it looks pretty consistent if it is a fake then it is a damn good one not only noise is consistent gradiation in luma and chroma is also
  that fucking drop shadow on the moon    yeah its really real op
based on exif it was shot just after 7am the sun could have been rising by this time and lighting the tower enough to get a decent exposure on both tower and moon
  its not a drop shadow its an artifact of shadow recovering/highlight reduction
  thats awesome what did you use to separate the objects
  shoot moon overexposed  luminosity mask moon  bring down highlight for moon only    wow magic
  in this case the objects seperate by themselves the hue analysis reduces the area to r g and b the moon is red becuase he graded reds in hilghlights and blues in shodows the point it it is consistent    as an example for a fake i show you a noise pattern analysis where you can see what inconsistent means
  shoot moon 710 stops overexposed  just brings the highlights down bro  magic indeed
  thought its questionable at thirst not so sure now    dimensions of the moon are all right it appears no cropping was done ive 600 equivalent and thats roughly what you get on moon shot there is some questions regarding both tower and and moon being in focus at f57 but i think its somehow possible if he was really far from the tower it could be possible by focus stacking but that would throw raw claim out of the window not going to put my hand into fire for it but im more leaning to the authentic side of it
  you must suck at editing
the moon sets in the northwest sky there so this is plausible
  either date matches up but the clock on camera was an hour off or the time matches up but this was shot on the 16th
    shoot moon just at the edge of clipping  bring it down one stop  bring the shadows up five stops much easier    its plausible with todays super cameras you should stop using janky 1980s euro cams
  this  the fotog that shot ops pic really knows what he is doing and it seems obvious that he planned out the shoot in advance     right gear  right time  right place  right technique
  either that or he was just driving around and saw a badass photo op    i think its real
    he definitely planned it you would be surprised how fast the moon moves in the sky he had a window of maybe 2 minutes where the entire moon was in frame and only 30 seconds where it was intersecting with the tower
        great detective work  to conclude the investigation you should interrogate the clouds how he convinced them to move behind the moon for a bit does he have dirt on them or he just asked nicely    and wheres that raw file the op is talking about
    i mean most of those posts were conjecture but     is actual legit detective work and it looks like the photo is actually real
  thanks i do this for a living though
  thats when the image was created by lightroom not when it was taken thats still probably the key though it was probably taken during brighter twilight to counter the brightness of the moon at 1/500 sec and 400 iso it was probably a lot brighter out than the photo leads you to believe
  
    this is nothing like the peter lik photo get out of here with your lazy replies

  how many stacks
  none  1 shot
  you wont get as close but you should be able to get a positive id
throughout my years of photography i have learned one thing you do not want to mess with moon autists the lengths these guys go to to get the perfect shot is absurd and i have no doubt that this guy spent months at this location during both day and night prior to taking this shot
  this is the first time i have laughed out loud from an australia down under joke    thanks anon
  just dropbox the raw file and well be the judge  no need for all this mumbo jumbo armchair talk
  lol well played
idk rly know anything about photoshop or editing photos bc i dont really fuck with mine personally but that shit is mad edited bro nobody can do that with just color grading
fake as fuck and anyone who believes it is dumb as fuck
i know this guy and its def a legit photo   not faked in any way he has the kit it was an amazing night and he got the shot
all these wild accusations from both sides    this is exactly why you film your photography sessions people its really easy to just set up a gopro or record your cameras display with your cell phone so that you can prove what the picture looked like incamera
  so i actually live in this city and the framing is 100 achievable in my opinion you can see the tower from every direction and the size matches up from memory of the super moon the only thing im not sure about is the exposure in a single shot but then again ive never worked with a 1dx
  the size matches up from memory of the super moon
luckily he did film it this video was done just after the shot was taken im assuming he faked this too  search for photox  canberra photography services on facebook and look under videos to have a look   op is just a jealous local tog i would say
  since i can confirm that the photo is 100 real you should probably reevaluate yourself as a human and stop posting online 
my mate took this photo its real australia is a small place
seems like the moon is rising at 2am so f trying this out tonight
  no u
  guess that solves that
    i mean this basically settles it giannis you gonna admit defeat
photo contests should just outsource their vetting and judging to us
i know the photographerabsolutely no way its a fakehes amazing at his job and this is just another example of his skillwasnt there to verify but all the work he has done for me has been of exactly that quality
  is that saturn on the lower left corner
  i thought it was andromeda
  matching his settings with a 100400 with 2x    you arent matching his settings you are using a zoom with poor iq and he is using a proper prime    i suspect his image also has a considerable crop but i wouldnt be surprised if he was mostly telling the truth        noise pattern analysis is hit or miss once compressed especially when run through facebooks terrible image compression
  op here   the image uploaded is the one he made available on the cloud was a direct download no saved off fb   i tried to replicate to learn to be a better photographer but cant get close all my versions have big halos which is why i wondered if it was fake
mfw i tried this at the first week of owning a dslr with a kit lens but a focking moon went above the little church instead of a nice behind thing
  noise pattern analysis is hit or miss once compressed especially when run through facebooks terrible image compression  you seem not to know things about this topic see   a compression which makes noise pattern analysis useless must also make the picture useless
  yeah
  eos1d x mark ii its 20mp ff sensor pixels are huge youre not in the same league when shooting anything else at night
  yup its possible he shor at the break of dawn with enough ambient  did he post the raw
    no but theres an eight second video on that facebook page of the moon setting to the left of the tower and you can clearly see the tower in it and the moon in the same exposure     and yeah he shot it at moonset/sunrise so there would have been the sun rising behind the photographer creating sufficient dawnglow to illuminate the tower
  care to do a webm  dont even have facebook mate
    you dont need one for public business pages    fbookcom /photoxben/
  im legit butthurt what are you calling me out on
  the only way to judge the size of the moon is in relation to the building youd need to know exactly how far he is away from it to know this
  plus the size difference during a supermoon is minuscule completely destroying the looks about right argument
  all my versions have big halos  i think its down to crazy low light and dynamic range performance my guess is youd have to underexpose a lot in order to get the moon exposed properly and then raise everything else up in post or bracket exposures
    no need to be butthurt its just bantz my man the supermoon is like maybe 7 bigger than normal but usually less than that the moon subtends a visual arc roughly equivalent to an aspirin or mm around 1 centimeter held at arms length so a supermoon would be an aspirin that is 107 centimeters instead i have pretty good eyes and have been studying astronomy since i was six but even i would have trouble discerning the difference with my naked eye
  maybe 7 bigger than normal but usually less than that  according to nasa the supermoon in the photo could actually have been up to 14 bigger it was a damn big moon
  thats no moon
  thats no moon  okay im a little confused
too me his stuff is a tad normie ftsoppers like but whatever     this is his profile pic too    www facebook com /photoxben/videos/1462659117095908/
  too me his stuff is a tad normie  yeah i looked at his portfolio and theres a bit too much contrast and garish overpowered flash in a lot of his photos
  its a space station
  its a space station  honestly i have no clue what youre talking about
  its a space station    unless theyve nicknamed one of the space stations supermoon im not and astronomer in any shape or form just a guy who can read
  lame joke    thinks star wars is a movie from 2015    needless explanation      further autism    never change /p/
i dont see any evidence of fakery nor can i think of a reason why anyone with the proper gear would have to fake it
  i agree it was a very shitty joke im surprised that people are so retarded they didnt understand it
  people are so retarded  not people just one me    thought it was in reference to the guy who called me stoooopid for saying the moon looked legit in size
  the moon looked legit in size  which given that the photo is legit doesnt it stand to reason that the moon was in fact that big i still stand by my comment lmao
  umm how about a 7s  ff 12mp
is the tower sharp or the moon do you have a higher resolution version tell the photographer about this thread see if they come to the party
  its goat nightvision camcorder i wouldnt take a pick with it though  
  well its a great camera as long as you accept that you will not be zooming in on details it takes great photos but once you zoom in you start seeing pixels pretty quickly    i think its a great match for vintage glass as any arguments of vintage lenses not being sharp are negated by the fact that the glass ends up still exceeding the resolving power of the sensor just kinda wish i had a 7s mk2 as image stabilization with vintage lenses sounds fun as hell
  fuck you moon
    i didnt get it either until explained
  cmon youre not arguing cinecam vs pro cam a7s is basically a camcorder same as that panasonic cam with low pixels and double native iso theyre not designed for still images
  a7s is basically a camcorder theyre not designed for still images  you are just plain wrong the a7s is the best low light stills camera which is also what it was designed for
  a7s is the best low light stills camera  top utter kek youre not serious its not even designed as a pro cam
  please feel free to name a better low light stills camera  protip you cant
  ehem   d5 being honourable mention dslrs are still in another league 7s is discontinued experiment anyway
  please feel free to name a better low light stills camera  when you normalize for resolution basically any modern full frame camera gives you similar levels of noise but a significantly sharper image than the a7sii this is true across brandsnikon canon pentax and even its sister cameras the a7iii and a7riii     so pretty much any of the current generation of full frame digital cameras is a better lowlight stills camera than the a7sii
  dslrs are still in another league  why do you think the addition of mirrors makes them in another league  protip theyre not    7s is discontinued experiment anyway  nah the next 7s is going to have a 36mp native sensor that can bin down to 9mp
  unless theres color in the image then the 7s clearly beats the 1dx mk2
    iso2milion    do they have one for base or low iso that high isos are in unusable range you look at top quality low light performance for still photography at iso1000 max often lower than that good comparison would be low iso and dark scene      7s is going to have a 36mp native sensor that can bin down to 9mp  lol you mean crop down for video ala eosr
  iso2milion  i used the same iso as the post i was replying to    lol you mean crop down   no i mean binning do you even know what binning is   protip it helps in low light significantly helps video too
  the 7s still looks better at iso 1600 and 800
  and heres the pic of iso 800 notice how the 7s looks better
  why do you think the addition of mirrors makes them in another league  youre awfully naive not mirrors sensors d5 1dx are pro cameras they are designed for optimum performance at various events speed and quality at low iso is everything thats one step ahead of high res cameras designed for landscape stock art and some studio work where you can wait and experiment with slower shutter speeds to get the right quality a7 5d d850 once one becomes established you get market diversification as in 5d s 5d r but its not making them a different level
  youre awfully naive not mirrors sensors  many dslrs literally use the same sony sensors as used in sony mirrorless cameras it is also well known that sony sensors are better than canon sensors i think sony finally surpassed canon in sales of full frame cameras too you sound like a canon fan boy who is in denial that someone finally overtook them both in sales and technologically

colour has always been good enough out of the raw files by default without fussing around with film presets or that kind of thing for me     it does seem more than my other cameras to need a lot of curve adjustments though in addition to usually just leaving the thing on 1/3 at least exposure comp maybe thats just an x100s thing though     just dont buy into the sooc jpeg meme and play around til you figure out your process    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makefujifilmcamera modelx100scamera softwareadobe photoshop lightroom 614 macintoshmaximum lens aperturef/20sensing methodonechip color areaimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20180321 213833exposure time1/1100 secfnumberf/56exposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating250lens aperturef/56brightness93 evexposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length2300 mmcolor space informationsrgbrenderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardsharpnesshardsubject distance rangeunknown
  not him but these  step 1 switch to a different sim like pro neg std  step 2 mess with shadow highlight and colour settings until it looks good  step 3 experiment with the other sims in a similar fashion  step 4 post results  white balance settings will have as much influence on look as anything
  shoot classic chrome  post on instagram  done
    hey thats me    i generally shoot neg std for the preview in the evf but if i was shooting sooc id probably use that with contrast and highlights or classic chrome with saturation    i still edit all my raws and i usually shoot rawjpeg and use the jpeg as a guide sometimes    all the snow stuff is generally shot underexposed and raised carefully so i dont get too much harsh white though    it is certainly a capable camera but the most important thing is still the light and scene before it hits the camera    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makefujifilmcamera modelx100fcamera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2019 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/20sensing methodonechip color areaimagespecific propertiesimage width1400image height1120number of bits per component8 8 8pixel compositionrgbimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20181024 080511exposure time1/750 secfnumberf/80exposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating200lens aperturef/80brightness110 evexposure bias1 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashflashfocal length2300 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width1400image height1120renderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balancemanualscene capture typestandardsharpnessnormalsubject distance rangeunknown
  i come from shooting film and got an x100t as an every day shooter but i dont like the colors im getting sooc using classic chrome    most people coming from film are disappointed with digital colors that is the way it is the instagram filters the fuji cameras have helps but they arent really all that great    your only option is to shoot raw and post process
  shoot raw plus a film preset and git gud if you dont fuck up you wont have much work to do in post
  lmfao the colour of that sky fuji shooters are fucking blind
  admittedly most shooters are slapping polarizers on their lenses just to emulate the same look but yeah saturation 10000 over here
    x100f here     i shoot the film sim bracketing     usually standard acros and either velvia if its outdoor or proneghi if people     this camera is an enjoyable toy why not use the features it came with    if i wanted to spend 4 fucking hours on a raw image this is not the camera id carry around     just shoot jpg and enjoy yourself
  do you have a blog
  x100f here too used to have the s before that    i shoot raw and have been having way better results with capture one than with lightroom in regards of the colors if that helps
  another recent one
  thats a good shot mountains and wides dont do well for me but you somehow managed it that lens is something like 33mm film equivalent
  as a fuji shooter i never fuck with the film presets they dont look like film at all the only thing thats cool is looking through the evf and seeing everything black and white     shoot raw and lrn 2 edit
  wew i wish i had foggy forests like that here in socal great shot
    beautiful shots anon where do you live these looks comfy
  thanks    im a frenchfag but those were taken in greece    the x100f is a pretty cool camera for travel snapshots
  that looks dope where exactly in greece
  mount olympus for the first two meteora for the third one and this one
ive been shooting with xtrans since 2014 and converting raffiles to dng while importing to lightroom have i ruined my library can i sue adobe
does what it says on the tin    me     now post your own
        awesome architecture shots the black and white photos are done very tastefully      nice consistency with all of your images they all have a very similar color scheme
  not my jam but you have a defined style keep it up    definitely instagram friendly travel photography i appreciate the restraint in your edits    great use of color congratulations on the engagement       i dont have a style yet maybe one day ill figure out what sort of creative i want to be
      cool shapes but some of these have leading lines that fall flat and lead to nothing       these are technically fine landscapes but i personally cant find anything in them that i connect to i do like the yellow ferns in arizona though       your abstract stuff is much better than the rest also consider toning down the saturation and hdr       some of these like the bird on the tree and the beach photo could be cropped better that long exposure by the river is really nice though im a fan of that one
  also consider toning down the saturation and hdr     i actually dont do any hdr theyre all single exposures with the exception of the panoramas but yeah i could probably do with less saturation thanks for the cc
currently compiling shots for a book i want to make on new zealand       wwwryanlindborgcom      love the tones  the crispness      love the natural patterns good eye
instagram is the poor mans art gallery    cant get one of your own
  okay this is epic
  attention all /p/ photographers anon is severly impoverished and he needs your help to get a photogallery to do this he needs a high foot traffic commerical space and a nonsony camera to help him all he needs is your credit card number the three numbers on the back and the expiration month and date but you gotta be quick so that anon can secure the shot and become a p r o photographer

mostly citystreet stuff as of late        decent archi this is the kind of stuff i wanted to shoot when i started on insta but i was shit and ended up shooting plain bland one dimensional inside/outside archi stuff instead    particularly impressed with the lensball looking manipulation shots spherisize in photoshop      cool haunted/minimalist/cultist vibe in some of these and as a set well curated  the death valley ghosts shot is awesome   only criticism i have is theyre a little oversaturated at times      also has a mellow/haunted vibe at times you dont have much yet but you have projects and ideas that are working phantom one could be cool  for what its worth your curation is a little all over the place and it feels like youre sticking in shots just because you thought they looked cool      real mellow and comfy reminds me of sean tuck but less shit/generic  your night stuff is a little busy and full of dead space      feels like you wanted to be a travel account and descended into a personal account sharing snapshots which is fine but it makes giving you any feedback hard decide what you want to shoot and stick to it for a while
  im   thanks for the thoughts youre absolutely right ive only been shooting for a year or so and i didnt want to stick to one subject/style/look just yet the random client work doesnt help either
  i have nonironically two different accounts with two distinct subjects    first one and maybe main / personal account    chiereguinie  
  second one is more to a riot / rally thing that ill be posting some street over the time    desordem  
    my shit post instagram newly started plan is to put pics of sluts on it
  only criticism i have is theyre a little oversaturated at times    this seems to be the number 1 criticism ill try to work on it in the future
  ah youre the bolsonaro thread guy
  good shot really tells a couple stories
hello fungipower    mostly hanging out at shows        yo im a bruin too and i love the photojournalism stuff especially the ones not at school      good stuff you know exactly what you are doing   the only thing is a really abundant amount of people doing the type of photography you do so the market is super saturated and much more competitive        im kinda bias in the sense that i think photos with faces are better but the photos are nice i wish you everyone would hone in more on a specific subject and do a deep dive on that
    enter the portrait
  nice composition and attention to textures       its kind of missing a theme that would connect all the photos together but the shots on their own are interesting      i like your night cityscapes      feels like a diary to me comfy      that icm tree shot is dope as fuck      i like your riot account better but the first one has some neat shots too      nice old days punkish feel to it i like that      not too shabby but id tone down on the other stuff if you want to focus on portraits and get more people to follow  heres my stuff mostly snapshits from my outings / cabin shenannigans i also like to bitch about editing and composition from time to time

you probably saw lot of these already posted here in various /rpt/s but never posted in insta threads  its not even a year since i bought my camera so pretty much noob here    
  do you want to be my gf
    probably the most derivative photos itt
    oh thank you to be honest im not really inspired by any photographers so to speak in fact i dont know any photographers by name other than ryan mcginley and terry richardson    i enjoy going to underground shows a lot and have been in love with listening to music since a very young age i felt that some of these shows are so underground that if i didnt take photos and show it off nobody in the god damn world would have known it was going on    never looked at myself as much of a photographer either i use the same setting iso 800 f/8 1/40 ss flash on for every photo and i mostly shoot photos when i am at shows it doesnt take a lot of technical skills but i am always around subjects i am interested in and taking photos of things i am passionate about and i hope people can empathize with my passion through the photos
        do you have any photographers that you would recommend i check out i literally only know ryan mcginley and terry richardson by name
  lol way to take the same shots of the same locations that everyone else in the genre takes    also dont act like youre fooling anyone reposting the same photos over and over and over again in your feed    hack
is there anyway to get some sort of following on ig for pictures just regular posting
    i need to start a photo thread soon
  pictures of leaves  ok
    i think the most effective way is to tag relevant accounts to your picture i personally shoot a lot of concert pics and i make sure to tag the artist/event promoter/venue in the photos i post so people can find it    from my experience using hashtag helps to get your individual posting exposures likes but using tags help you gain people interested in your work as a whole followers    but hey im sure concert photography cant be applied to everything else
  
  faggot newfag shitter with a small 1k follower count here   i think i got most of my followers when other people who ive shot with posted our stuff on their insta   im trash and follower count doesnt mean much

  i like that you have a consistent hue/color you are going for but i feel your choice makes the photos a bit tacky      this is one of the top 3 in this thread so far every shot is interesting      consistent but like the others have said a bit too formulaic still one of the best in this thread considering your technical ability      sorry but this feels a bit soulless these shots could use more of your own personality instead of relying on the model      your ig is almost like a newsfeed of the music scene in your area consistent and confident your photos dont look professional so to speak but who cares its diy

    please explain your reasoning
lewywu      rebuilding my account old one is lewywu  i shoot pretty much whatever but the only thing consistent are models
  a1  everything is very flat and theres no discernible subject with only minimal thought to composition  b1  probably one of the two best in this set but still nothing that draws you in the eye stops right at the first set of big rocks then jumps to the cloud you paid no attention to contrasts  c1  again flat there is no dimension to this conversion at all you make everything this kind of strange average  a2  more of c3  b2  maybe your best shot  c2  not bad either  a3  is the subject meant to be the mountain if so why is one covered by a cloud also zero thought to foreground  b3  literally a picture of a sign no subject no composition you literally posted an image that you accidentally took while holding your phone by your side as you were filling your car is what this looks like snapshit  c3  same as c2 nothing is here snapshit  a4  same as c3 snapshit  b4  is the subject these shitty buildings if so youve done nothing to make them interesting also theres a tree growing out of it so you didnt think about composition at all   c4  maybe the best overall conversion still no interest in the subject  a5  see c4  b5  eh could have been interesting but the horrible composition feels so low effort if you had spent just two minutes walking around for a better angle this could have been interesting  c5  not as bad as some of the others but still not enough punch  a6  this could have been a great landscape shot but again the conversion is horrible its so flat that field needs to be brighter and the trees and shrubs darker same goes for the contrast between the sky and windmills  b6  again whats the subject i look at the rv then the weird barn roof then the sky then the trees theres no anchor here no composition and no subject  c6  you really need to stop posting accidental photos
    ill take constructive critique where i see it but overall your attempt at critique is sophmoric and shallow im glad i asked for clarification because it revealed that youre more interested in tearing random strangers down than giving a thoughtful critique and no one should take toxic advice like yours seriously  so i wont

  i like your landscapes makes me want to get back to colorado something in the film or processing of the recent ones hurts my eyes though that pinkish tint is getting to me probably just me though      another one having fun with it not a fan of everything on your feed but there were some nice ones in there seems like you dropped the unnecessary white framing good 
  yep i guess i thought it was cool but then i realized that it looked stupid and unnecessary so i stopped i still feel bad for not using it though i dont like how instagram uses a 45 ratio for portraits but i guess its fine
  use them when you need to to make the photo fit the way you want to get the right aspect and hell any other time i just dont like them because i have to zoom in more often to see whats going on in the image 
      yeah i wasnt a big fan of the colors of that roll either provia 100f
  thanks for your thoughts i dont like the tone either but as i need to test my new camera i bought the cheapest fuji 500t i could found i did post them in ps mostly camera raw tho but felt kind of guilty to totally balance the cyan out of them    a lot of people lile the egg i dont know why either its just handheld lens reversal but looks so mistique i dont know    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2018 windowsimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution3000 dpivertical resolution3000 dpiimage created20181113t2110062100
  ah that was film totally makes sense now i didnt catch that when i was looking through them
  in general i like your stuff some of it is really good i think but some of your black and whites like too much like line drawings im back and forth on it but have decided i personally dont like them that way again thats more about my personal taste than anything else also suspect that they might not look that way full size could be the loss of detail on ig thats making them look that way to me      really like what youre doing loved all the slot canyon shots maybe i can make it out there this trip to get some for myself good stuff      also love yours really good dont really have anything else to say about it       i really enjoy the variety of your feed       i swear everyone has been to antelope canyon but me nice grid        youve got some good shots but in general is not clicking with me i get that youre doing a project because you say you are but i dont really get it from the photos but im gonna accept that its my issue not yours       looks kinda random and slapped together which makes sense given your other account but hey george takei       i like your street shots and the forest shots where you didnt fuck with the trees make the stretched tree thing stop its filling up my feed the last few days and fucking with my eyes get off my lawn      i like your landscapes      some good shots in it journalistic feel which makes sense      your one image had potential post more    done for now
  i like the portraits the rest however doesnt seem to go through the same level of thinking      really good stuff the wildlife pictures especially are very crisp some of the landscapes like this one   are a bit overedited but theyre few and far between       some nice stuff here im more of a nature photographer but the one picture in your feed that caught my eye was this one    that i found very calming      theres a certain serenity in like half of your pictures something smooth not too fond of the recurring shots of the camera itself though      great stuff there in different styles      theres too much stuff going on here of very varying quality       could be very good but you need to go lighter on the split toning    as for me     mainly nature photography
  its wwwinstagramcom/matosan25 by the way
    because /p/ is full young guys with big egos and mediocre skill
  not really they just dislike generic stuff    also dropping your number of followers is a flawed argument popular doesnt necessarily mean good
wwwinstagramcom/mb_718    constructive criticism is appreciated
    i just began this account where i post my snapshit accepting either bashing or criticism just be honest with me
  i agree so much    there is nothing more boring than generic eye pleasing stuff
if you have borders/frames that werent required when you posted to ig then i dont like it ig isnt a gallery its more like a photo album a cheap one with 30 wallet sized plastic pockets for holding the images also i dont like having to zoom  and yeah get off my lawn      not what i normally get into but i still like your work youve got some interesting shots in there       very consistent and a definite theme another one where im not really into the content but i think youre doing good stuff you need a local music blog      i dont really agree with your landscape compositions id have the horizon lower in the frame on a few of them but like your stuff and the way you handle colors in the night shots cool stuff       nice if somewhat random shots a few in there a really like and i think those might have been somewhat more random for you too woman and little girl cooking for example youd be a fun guy to have in a local photography group  your fish eye shot of the milkywayv was great i thought      ok sorry for the flood of likes i like the processing and composition of your shots and even when i dont care about the subject theyre still good      not my thing but there are random shots i liked im definitely not the target audience       like the shots that you planned for the more random looking stuff looks like you didnt take as much time to process so they dont really fit as well with the rest of your grid thats my take on it

mainly street photography looking for some feedback 
  just had one of my photos featured on a photography page feels good lads a bit of recognition amongst my peers
  a couple of the pictures i took were featured on a fat acceptance page   influx of fatfuck hamplanet followers  is this my punishment for acceptng portrait sessions of literally anyone and not having standards
  im sorry for your loss but atleast you can use this exposure to take photos of nonfat women and change the fatties ways of thinking
  change the fatties way of thinking  never happening i already take pictures of nonfat people already   the only thing that is happening is that im being celebrated as being a body positive photographer
  well anon its not a bad thing
    i dont think he is saying its bad it just sucks to always be overshadowed by that idea
i just started this ig account a week ago my skills are very basic i using my dads nikon d3200 and lightroom to edit these constructive criticism welcome here feel free to follow me as well    
  seriously town down the postprocessing and focus on composition emotion and storytelling you have a bunch of uninteresting photos that youre trying to convert into something worthwhile with heavy split toning hdr etc it wont work
  tone down

  add mikiko hara shes literally one of the best contemporary photographers currently alive
  i thought it was cool but then i realized that it looked stupid and unnecessary    seems like you dropped the unnecessary white framing good     framing isnt neccesarily a bad thing its depends on how and when you use it a frame can add or take away character to a photo it all depends on how sensibly its used
hello guys im pretty new its very flawed and im unconfident as fuck with it i know aspect ratio its an absolute mess try to focus more on the photos themselves im kind of happy with my postprocessing in recent photos the pics are probably not that interesting thats why i end up posting several at a time    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwarewindows photo editor 1001001116384imagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandimage created20181122 171359color space informationsrgb

  if youre in nyc and you cant find people to shoot you are a failure
  ppls no bully i have no idea how this works
  ill give you some advice for free then    youre in nyc you see beautiful characters on a daily basis that is if you leave your apartment    just ask to take their picture or dont ask most of the time they will be thrilled to get noticed
    ill give you some advice for free then  free  lmao look at this fucking gook nigger waving his dick high go back to rddit faggot         just message models people on ig   the worst situation will be they say no   so what  just dm people and see if it works out  usually these model and photog deal work in like they model in your photos and you give them photographs in return so its a win win situation you dont pay them   also if you like someone on the street just go to them and ask them for photograph if you dont want their candid you can take their candid while walking on street or sitting alone if you dont wanna be a street style blogger then candids are the best

what other compositions are ruining photography
  what compositions are bettering photography
    holy shit an interesting question on /p/
    the ones you have with you
  girl half turning away but looking back and pulling the photographer  i hate those
  one of the worst for sure
  i hate the reach out with the branded watch on wrist
    goddam instagram has a lot to answer for
  oh theres more
      is crushing the blacks the current filter meme
photography cant be ruined only your ego can other peoples enjoyment of an image doesnt effect you but you let it get to you why    i dont require my cheese burger to be different and unique every time to enjoy it normies dont require the photos they look at to be unique to enjoy them because photos are like food to them and thats fine
the headache pose
  i like the cut of your jib
  lol never ran into this one in the wild but oh man its dumb as hell  i am reech out and grab teh nature xd
  its a mixure of crushing the blacks but then putting a milky filter over that to make that effect i think theyre trying to make it look like old film      i fucking hate it man i have a couple friends who try stuff like that    im not exactly hating on all of it with billions of photos on ig there are bound to be similar photos especially when theres a popular location but i just hate cheesy shit like that
  well i for one love to go to a scenic location and throw coffee all over everything
  fucking reeeeeeeeee    instagram is not only ruining photography but pretty much everything it touches
  in no way is instagram ruining photography
  im going to agree with this guy here   ig is only making photography more popular but with it comes the people that only take cliched photos which like i said isnt all bad they can be fun but it does get pretty damn repetitive
  beg your pardon old chap i for one would like to disagree with such a sentiment one could quite associate this reaching hand to the reaching hands of bumbling zombies seen nowadays in these jolly wretched horror films and firmly ingrained in ones collective consciousness having such hand reach out from behind the camera puts one in the zombies perspective the branded watch if i may suggest could be construed as a metaphorical cattle branding a beastly mindcontrolling collar that turns the wearerand by veiled allusion the viewer mind youinto a vacuous oafish zombie perpetually reaching towards an unreachable promised land verily a golden apple of eternal desire i say a marvellously astute metacommentary on present society and its rather woeful effect on hoi polloi indeed
any landscape photograph that has a fucking man in the photo    if you are going to have a person in a landscape photo you shouldnt it should at least be a girl    im not gonna use a fucking man landscape photo as my wallpaper fuck you
    ahh yes i can see where youre coming from landscape photographers go out to take photos specifically because they want you to pirate their work for a wallpaper so sorry that we offended you by shooting something that didnt fit your specific fetish so you could steal it     cunt
  shut up bitch
  lets expand this to any photo if i see a photo of a man the photo is instantly trash    the only two genres of photography that actually matter is female portraits and pictures of cars
  tuttut bad form
  you should only shoot cars n gurls  boomer/10

  the npcs of the photography world take these photos   instagram likes good  fade filter good  this location good   so brave so daring and so original
  uploads a photo on the internet  gets mad when someone clicks on it and saves it instead of sending you 40 sheckles     is there anyone in the universe of art that is a bigger fucking whiner than photographers for fucks sake if you dont want your photos stolen its entirely in your fucking power yet here you are bitching and fucking moaning about your work being stolen ie a picture saved and used as a shitty wallpaper for a few weeks on some randos iphone
lets not forget guys who take photos of their feet dangling off cliffs or out of helicopters    imagine planning on paying over a hundred dollars to take a photo of your shoes for instagram
  3season tent on snow covered summit  doubtjpg
    imagine being this retarded     i didnt say nobody was allowed to use the photos what i did say was that you dont have any right to bitch and moan about a single one of my artistic choices if youre not fucking paying for it
    imagine having a successful career as an influencer so you dont have to pay for that stuff     i love coming to 4chin and reading all the complaints made by people who never leave the couch
  influencer  narcissist npc with robust photoshop skills who happens to use a camera taking instagram cliche photos
  lmao
  theres too much genuine stupidity here for the fake stupidity to stand out
    sorry youre so bitter tons of people make tons of money doing it if it allows them to travel and do fun shit and use a camera then its a win in my book you can sit on your couch spanking your dick to hentai and bitching about it on the internet if you want
  im going to have to disagree with you there the npcs are the ones giving likes comments and impressions on their photos allowing them to charge for their service to travel the world youre a statistic theyre the one living

tis the season for camera savings if you see any black friday or other great deals post em here please dont turn this into a shill thread    resources  deal sites          retailers        rumor sites      
  yeay the time of the year to fool people with fake savings and  numbers  grey import still be cheaper
do you guys actually buy cameras new
  except my first body and two lenses i bought nearly all of my gear from native lenses tripod to flash used so many people have this expensive hobby but dont use their stuff and try to sell it in like new condition for cheap sometimes half the new price the loss of value is insanse kinda like cars if you sell it used again this loss is much smaller than when you buy new  depending on your countrys laws you have to do without any warranty though
  yeah if i dont know how something has been treated i dont want it
  if i wanted to get a d500 i could saved upwards of 300 bucks buying used
  i do but im a professional and have the budget for it
  only if theres a really good deal on or if its something that im tired of waiting to find used
thinking about grabbing a sigma 150600 if i can find a good deal on one but kinda hesitant at the same time because its still gonna be like a grand on sale and the season for shooting wildlife is pretty much over already
  the only things i ever buy new are consumables that will likely change in the future since a lot of 4 year old kit is more expensive second hand than from grey imports these days completely nuts
am in uk if any niggaz know of any deals over here let us know
  looks like shit that i dont want at a price that im unwilling to pay for each of those cameras
  keep an eye on lensrentals on black friday they at least used to do these flash sales on good used gear i got my canon 70200mm f/28 ii for like 1600 and the thing was barely used
  i think the best way to get entry level gear is to buy it off facebook from someone who got it and barely if ever used it
  damn checked and a cracking deal
    same although the sigma 150600 isnt in stock right now unfortunately
  yes i go to a particular country with low prices i always buy face to face so i can test samples first hand
  bodies yes  lenses no
  600 for an a6000   god damn was hoping to get one of the newer models during blackfriday but if the a6500 is already at that price then fucking forget it
  if the a6500 is already at that price  
tfw still too in debt to take advantage of any deals  i want that 1424 so bad
  go more into debt     you need that 1424 think of how much happier youd be with it dont think about the cost thats an abstract concept youll have lots of time in the future to pay down that debt right now youre missing good photos because you dont have that lens you work hard and you deserve it    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwaregoogleimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpicolor space informationsrgbimage width280image height280scene capture typestandard
  this right here also not being a poorfag helps
   go more into debt     going into debt for camera gear   going into debt  shiggy diggy
  thats fair as a rule i rub my balls on anything i sell on ebay
    that lens will be worthless when nikon makes a real wide angle zoom for zmount
  this is why i got finance for my x100f if i paid it off on time it wouldnt have cost me any extra than buying it outright    as it happens my stupid parents stopped giving me enough allowance so i had to sell the camera to cover my debt but it was great for the 6 months i had it
  yeah why the fuck would i want to put my face up to a view finder some sweaty cunt has had their disgusting face oils all over same with the screen grip lenses
  z mount  who cares
  you say that now but just wait till you see how true wide angle lens can perform
  why would a wide angle be better on a z mount that makes no sense
  same reason their new zmount 35mm is better than the old ones
  basic optics the focal length is the distance from the focal plane to the lens that only really applies to very simple singleelement lenses and modern optics have a lot more going on so the focal length rarely corresponds directly to the distance from the optics to the focal plane but theres usually a strong correlation     except you cant do that with wideangle lenses the flangefocal distance of the nikon f mount is 465mm which means nothing wider than 465mm can use a simple lens design like that instead they have to use a retrofocus designbasically a telephoto design turned around if youve ever looked through binoculars or a telescope backwards youll know how that works     moving the flange focal distance closer to the image plane 16mm for the zmount means that they can get away with wideangle lenses that use a much simpler design simplifying that part of the design means that more effort can be channeled into other aspects of the lens design to make it sharper produce better colors correct for more optical issues etc     note im certainly not wellversed in the nitty gritty intricacies of optical design so if someone more knowledgeable is in the thread feel free to correct me
  yup as well as lower cost for smaller front elements    you could even do what sony has done and make the furthest front element thee aspherical
deals
  you could even do what sony has done and make the furthest front element thee aspherical  d and canon acted like they invented reversing the 35mm optics on the new rf mount
  bigger mount  better quality  sony can dance around truth all day but it wont change the fact that canon now offers best mirrorless lenses for third of the price of sonys zeiss branded monstrosities
  canons mount is worse because it is 20mm flange
i picked up one of those a7ii with the shitty 2870 lens deals for 999    man that lens sucks donkey balls  the camera is so so  ive got some adapters for manual f and md glass so that has been keeping me occupied but overall im not super impressed with this thing
  finance  parents  allowance    wait  what
  for real at least when i said i was in debt it was because i had to make a huge emergency purchase earlier this year and an paying it off with my salary
  there is a reason why everybody recommend that tamron zoom
  is that the 2875 28
  yup
  youre confusing flange distance with backfocus distance although its ugly if necessary a lens can reach into the mount it was a wellconsidered decision to prevent mounting rf lenses on other systems we should wipe the smirk off canons face that eventually they start building good bodies again
  eventually they start building good bodies again  yeah like that will ever happen
  it was a wellconsidered decision to prevent mounting rf lenses on other systems  bullshit the zmount will easily be able to mount manual rf lenses    if canon wanted it to be impossible they would have made the flange 16mm instead of 20
  collapsible leica 50mm is probably an issue  its super close on e mount
  its basicly a milcwip camera from 2014 you shouldnt have exspected an mark 3 type of performance  the lens is totally ok for a kit lens if you correct it in post seen worse    im from europe dont have that 999 deal grey import price is 875 current amazon price is 1111 sony offers 150 cashback with some dealers maybe i should wait those other two weeks exspecting they will sell it with some discount even 86 off would allready fill the gap man i hate waiting
  just clean it you slob
  right now youre missing good photos because you dont have that lens    load of nonsense
  i got a used pentax with two lens lenses lense what is the plural of a plural in english for 400  how did i do

is there a point in buying from an official retailer if the warranty is onky one year  grey market is usually like 200off but hard to find a kit  wondering if bullshit friday monday will have a good deal otherwise ill just buy it cash from those photo stores in manhattan
  i think its unlikely that youll have any issues while the camera is under warranty unless youre a very active shooter even then these products are built very well
  huh i was thinking of getting the a7ii because of that sale price but now i might hold back  is it really that bad of a camera been looking for something to replace my t5i since its kinda broken and was thinking of going towards the mirrorless side for my replacement
  will the a7ii be cheaper on black friday
  its way better than a t5i but you have to remember the a7ii is still a camera from 2014    all the native lenses either suck or are stupid expensive and adapting glass is kinda a waste of time desu    i regret buying one
  bought sold and almost made my money back on every camera and lens so far the exception is my current a7iii which i expect to decrease in value by more than 20 over the next few years but then im unlikely to buy another camera so other than filters my photography has been almost completely rented for free
  ah i see any mirrorless you can recommend then at a similar price point around that 1000 range
  huh i was thinking of getting the a7ii because of that sale price but now i might hold back  is it really that bad of a camera  its not bad per se but having used both the a7ii and higher end canon bodies id recommend against jumping ship to mirrorless quite yet    1 lenses are expensive as shit neither sony nor third parties really makes cheap lenses for the fe full frame sony mount yet and the system hasnt been around long enough for there to be cheap old stuff if you want autofocus   2 the af system is annoying its much more complicated to manually control where youre focusing about on par with your t5i but you dont get the control that you get on a higher end canon   3 high iso noise isnt great its better than your t5i but not as good as a 5d mark iii   4 battery life sucks youll want to charge your battery every day you use the camera possibly multiple times if you use it a lot   5 the controls are poorly placed like deliberately so that you cant hit them by accident but it has the side effect that its a little harder to hit them on purpose     there are definitely advantages though  1 inbody image stabilization is niiiice  2 its got a flippy screen not as good as your canons but better than the fixed screens on higher end canons   3 evfs are better for manual focus if your shooting style works well with manual focus you can get around the expensive native lens issue with cheap adapters and cheap vintage lenses   4 or if you just like playing with old lenses a sony can mount just about anything
  not the film ones
  1 lenses are expensive as shit  this do not look at body prices for sony models not even for apsc a6000 and a6300 always plan of getting a fast prime fast zoom as well if you want to get lens sharpness you should be getting out of the body even f4 constant aperture zoom for apsc goes for 1000eurodollars always have that in mind sony body  1000eurodolalrs if you dont have that much cash look elsewhere
    while this is true id argue theyre also some of the best modern lenses you can get especially when paired with a good sony fe body which typically have both ibis and incredibly fast caf/af and that tons of cheap lenses can and do exist regardless  i went from the a6k to the a73 and kept all my cheap glass and even shoot some sellable hits on the 2870 kit lens and i use both in ff and apsc because you essentially have an extra half a lens for every ff lens you buy on the fe    i also think one of the reasons that sony has expensive glass that people forget is that its also very good for video doesnt mean much if youre a photographer but i use instagram and youtube so the extra cost makes more sense for me    if youre an armature/hobbyist its hard to justify the cost of sony glass but then you probably shouldnt be buying an fe body anyway all that said im not sure how much of this is applicable on the a72 but interestingly all the things you mentioned were things theyve changed on the a73 the caf is godlike the native battery lasts a million years though costs a fucking ton too etc    /shill
  its good for video  wut thats actually wrong i guess its somewhat good for some streaming and that stationary nonsense but for proper faux cine lenses the system is shit nothing or super overpriced noting in between its to canon with magic lantern and panasonic where everyone goes
  theyre also some of the best modern lenses you can get  while this is true the better image quality isnt something youd actually notice in real photography ie unless youre shooting test charts like i can get a used canon 2870/28l for 620 but a used sony 2470/28 is over 2k the sony might be a little sharper but i could use that 1400 to also buy a canon 50/14 85/18 and 1740/4l and still have enough left over for an older model telezoom     incredibly fast af  the sony 200 50/18 cant hold a candle to canons 50/18 in terms of af speed i havent been able to test any of sonys other full frame lenses because i cant afford any right now
  does it have to be new
  the better image quality isnt something youd actually notice in real photography  i couldnt say but ill defer to your knowledge comparing against canon the reason people i know or have seen buy sony glass cite tends to actually be af so im surprised to see you mention it next i do use the sony 50 18 and agree the af speed on it is nothing short of a joke but a 200 lens doesnt qualify as expensive
      seems legit to me
  but a 200 lens doesnt qualify as expensive  not in the grand scheme of things but its on the high end for something as bogstandard as a nifty fifty not counting outliers like the zeiss 55/18 canons costs around 100 and you can get a yongnuo in ef or f mount for fifty bucks
  a6000 getting buttfucked by its kit lens    seems about right
  bodies yes lenses no
  true as this may be the 1424 is easily one of the most legendary 35mm lenses ever it achieves primelike sharpness in many focal lengths and apertures and its going to be big filling its shoes the only thing plaguing it  as someone who owns it  is that it flares like mad and getting filters on it is not simple or cheap
refurb nikon a900 for 167  i dont own a camera and im looking for something cheap to mess around with and take better pictures than my phone while being convenient to carry around is this a good deal
  nikons 50mm 18 g also costs 200 and the rest of their fullframe glass is expensive af as well eg the 2470 28 on amazon nikon 2400 sony 2100 some time ago i compared other ff lenses and prices were more or less even ff is expensive not sony
  sensor size 1/23  this wont take pictures that much better than your phone depending in your phone it might even be a little worse     i can give a suggestion for something with much better image quality but youll have to compromise on either size or price and youll lose the zoom rangethe zoom range is something youre just not going to find on a better camera without a big bag of expensive lenses since its hard to make long zooms like that that cover a larger sensor
  the zoom range seemed pretty beastly for what is was so i guess i wouldnt mind compromising on it id really rather not compromise on the portability though especially because it would make it more difficult to carry around while i do stupid stuff like climb on boulders on the coast during rough seas i guess ill spend more if you dont mind recommending something
  my point isnt really sony lenses are overpriced its there are not options for cheap sony lenses like there are with older brands which is a subtle but important distinction     ie instead of nikons 200 50/18 g you can buy the 50/18d for under a hundred bucks used granted that wont af on nikons lower end bodies but its an option if you get anything higher than a d5x00     so yeah the nikon latest 2470/28 is more expensive than the sony but you can get a tamron 2875/28 for 159 used or the old nikon 3570/28 for 250 or the older nonvr nikon 2470/28 for about 1000 they all fill about the same niche but you can save a shitton of money if you compromise a little bit on quality or age or zoom length or whatever with sony your only option is the brand new best of the best they just recently came out with a version of the tamron 2870 for e mount but its new so its still 800 vs 160 for an old nikon mount copy
  kehcom has some older model sony mirrorless cameras for relatively cheap nexc3 or nex5n are around a hundred and will give you much better image quality than that nikon for a lens you can get the 1650 for portabilitysmall zoom  low price or the sigma 30/28 for a little better quality but no zoom at all or the zeiss 32/18 for much better quality at the expense of size and price     camerasizecom is a good resource for checking out the relative sizes of cameras
  i get your point but it only applies if you want to stick with dslr mirrorless be it sony nikon canon they all have a new mount from those three sony being the longest in the game has the most lenses available and at least the most lenses on the used market  its less of a comparison nikon vs sony but dslr vs current state of milc    if you can life with slower and not always accurate af you can use af adapters and get nativedslr lenses or from other mounts like ef on nex  or go crazy with the techart pro    if you dont care about af at all you can always adapt nearly every manual lens out there
  if you want compact look into fuji xf1 xq series or an x10 their 2/3 sensors are pretty nice    you could also get an old slr like a d70 maybe even a d200 with a kit lens for that kind of money
  wouldnt a powershot or cybershot with a 1 sensor be a better option
  yeah im leaning more towards grey market but amazon also has no tax
the fuck is gray market
  oh for sure i was only talking about sony because the guy was contemplating a switch from canon to an a7 ii i just dropped 150 on a used shitty kit zoom for my fuji that wouldve been 30 if i needed one for my canon so im definitely not saying this is a uniquely sony issue
  i dont think so but ill keep an eye out
  its possible but the fujis put out great jpegs im never buying compact canon again because they always die unexpectedly of lens errors with sony unless you spend enough for a modern rx its not going to be very pleasant to use some of that could be personal preference but i always found them to have terrible ergonomics and ui
  grey market  or grey import or parallel import            its basicly unofficial imports from countries where the item is cheaper avoiding taxes and thus having a lower price sony a7rii eg is 1375 on ebay chinese seller shipped from ireland      ah well missed that yes its definetly more expensive but for me personally the small formfactor and evf of milc is totally worth the upcost i have more fun shooting with it and its so more convenient to take this litle camera a7ii with me compared to my dslr before
canon has some good deals on their refurb cameras but i dont think they intend for bfriday  sigma has bfriday deals for their lenses though
for the sony shooters 100 off the sigma mc11    
  oh shit bought thanks anon i was legitimately considering paying full retail for one of those a week ago
  me too im sure its been this price before but ive never seen it
  some marketplace dealers on amazoncom have the same price right now  you muricans are damn lucky with adorama and bhp being major players offering good deals all the time where i life its mostly amazon or overpriced camera shops  searching trough hundreds of chinese knock offs and filtering whats good and whats not is no fun i imagine this being better with own rebrands lables like flashpoint or glow    yes im jelly
  kehcom is doing their preblackfriday sale 25 off featured gear mostly shitty stuff but a few gems on the high end like the nikon df and 15 off everything else offer code pbf11e today only     i just bought a nikon d700 because im criminally irresponsible with my money
  there are some sites in the nl and belgium that offer really cheap shit but they are grey imports from hong kong or whatever should i risk it or is it like throwing my money in the trashcan
  would it be wise to order one when i live in belgium
  ive never lived in belgium so cant speak to the wisdom of it
instax mini 7 plus a ten pack of film for 50 mericas 
heres one crazy deal 500 off on gh85 with two lenses basically you can buy the cam wait a bit and sell the lenses for 500    
where do you think the cheapest d810 body will be and realistically how cheap should it be
anyone spy any good deals on some wide/ultrawide zooms a whopping 1200 dollars off of a 1500 lens is retarded and nikon can fuck themselves for calling that a deal
  legit thinking about buying the canon t6 bundle for 400 the shitty kit lens at least goes down to 18mm as opposed to the 35 dx prime ive got in my d5100
  damn already sold out
im budgeting for a decent upgrade from my old t2i and dont have a ton of cash to spring within the timeframe that i need it for im looking for anything 500 with a deal as low as possible preferable so i can put that money towards something like a zoom/tascam so far ive come up with a few lists including the panasonic gx85 or even one of the canon g7ss if i have to go that low but id love to get a sony if the price is right do you think deals on bh/amazon such as  are the lowest these retailers go for or should i wait for actual black friday/cyber monday for the best price
lens rentals does its black friday sales through lens authority     not many deals right now but everything is 10 off using code labf18
  no idea but thats quality deal i paid 800 for similar pack a year ago id sell sell 45100 for a hundred and buy used olympus 45100 for fifty better lens and you dont really need stabilization on lens since cam has ibis youll eventually need some fast prime but you could live with 1232 for a while and figure what focal length suits you best
  youre talking about this lens right     i sprung for the gx85 with both lenses used for about 420 the weed number and dont know if the pans lens is would be worth keeping since id use it for video mainly
  if you dont need it just dont bother it gives you 50 on the side for filter but isnt hugely superior
    should i sell my d7100 and lenses for one of these the canons more tempting to me as it actually has battery life
  you should question yourself if you have two grand extra to spend on lenses youll get nothing from this kind of bodies without quality glass
  im just a casual ive never spent 2k on an entire kit
borrow lenses has used rx100 mk 4 for under 450
i bought a7ii for 1k with the deal now theyre selling body only for 900 would the base lens be worth 100 i think id get the tamron instead
  this  been waiting for fujifilm xt100 or xt20 bodies to come down in price was 100 off all of last month and now theyre being touted around as the special black friday prices
leicarumors has a long list of deals  
  an a7 with the kit lens or a a6300 and some cheap objective for about the same price 800 which to choose
  shutters and electronics have a limited lifespan no way to know that the used camera you buy is going to work just for a year and the suddenly fail    lenses are a different story
here is petapixels list of black friday deals  
  yeah i havent found shit other than deals that have been around forever  i saw a gx85 with both lenses for 400 on some website and the canon m50 for 600 with 1545mm lense and a bag on canons webiste but so far the deals look dissapointing
  anon ive literally been searching for the same lens all week i havent found anything good
  lenses are a different story  not really unless its fully manual its got at least focusing done with electronics most of the time aperture as well cant be bothered to check but i think that even lenses that have aperture ring on the lenses are still just sending aperture info digitally to the camera
right now  amazones has the sony a7ii with 2870 for 998 amazonde the fe 50 18 for 159    fuck i can only pay with credit card i dont have or spanish gift cards on amazones
  lolimpus lenses are seeing healthy drop      few other pages as well    looking at it 60mm macro for 300 is a good deal and all f/18 primes are very tempting 25mm 45mm 17mm amazons also with 1240mm f28 for 500 will probably skip on everything was quietly hoping to get something substantial on 12mm f/2 but id rather buy one of the pro wide zooms for that kind of cash
  depends on what pentax it is and what lenses it comes with but even assuming these were two kits and a modern camera its not bad    also lenses you usually add es if word ends with s 
can someone find me a mint pentax k1 dont want a mark ii since im trying to keep it at around a grand
tfw no wide or ultra wide zooms at a steep discount
be me  bought canon eos 200d camera body for 550 bucks 1 week ago  black friday sale has the camera body  canon 50mm prime lens for 440 bucks

  boys ive wanted a dslr camera for literally years now and i finally have the money to pull the trigger on it its hard to resist but im obviously not an expert so i would like some advice    my eyes are set on a nikon d3400 and my options are either a 18105 vr lense or an afp 1855 vr and a afp 70300 vr  the latter would cost slightly more but i figure it would most probably allow me to do more stuff but im not sure whether the 70300vr objective is actually necessary    what do you think any advice is very welcome

can i really just buy an oldasfuck used dslr or digital mirrorless for less than 100 and then buy spendier lenses    how does a good lens somehow make the sensor better what the fuck does a good lens do
  can i really just buy an oldasfuck used dslr or digital mirrorless for less than 100 and then buy spendier lenses  yes or even buy an oldasfuck dslr or digital mirrorless for less than 100 and then buy relatively cheap lenses too     how does a good lens somehow make the sensor better   it doesnt however a big secret that the camera industry desperately hopes you wont learn is sensors have been good enough for quite a while now and they really only make small incremental upgrades to them they want you to believe that this years rebel or d3x00 blows away last years and that last years was hot pixellated garbage in fact youd be hard pressed to notice a difference in real image quality between a rebel xti ca 2006 and the latest greatest t6i or 7d mark ii or nikon d7500 or sony a6500 etc at least at matching isos one legitimate advancement being that the newer cameras can go up to much higher iso values    what a better lens does is it projects a better image on that sensor in terms of sharpness resolution lack of optical defects etc thats something that can have a noticeable difference in your actual image quality so a high quality lens on a shitty camera from a decade ago will often produce a betterquality image than a shitty lens from a decade ago on the latestandgreatest sensor available    that being said one of the opticallybest lenses you can get is a 50mm f/18 just because that optical formula is so crazy simple and wellunderstood after a century of making 50/18s so you dont really need massively expensive glass either just stay away from shitty filmera kit lenses if you want good optical quality
  are you saying that most models around 2006 are just as good in quality and that if i really want to go cheapest id buy one in that era 0608 for absolute bottom prices comparatively    one thing im curious about is lowlight/astrophotography/shootinginadarkroom since i like to really take photos with drastic differences in lightness have the improvements in the cameras ability to take a range of iso values 100a gazillion versus old style 10025000 directly correlate to a sensors capability to see lowlight without massive noise issues    im really fucking obsessed with taking photos that have absolute sharpness/crispness in them am i never going to get that with zoom lenses or is that why some zoom lenses are really fucking expensive what do they do better that leads to better resolution i use this term meaning ability to resolve fine detail or not blurry since im fucking retarded and see it used in multiple ways
  no deals for us our country a shit only theresa mays shitty deal
  took this a while ago for sharpness question someone was having first one is prime zoom kit lens the other one is 25mm prime mid tier price range lens for m43 its same location same light both are using same aperture and same focal distance   youre making some very complex questions answers arent straightforward and will depend from system to system a lot even from lens to lens modern telephoto zoom lenses tend to be very good compared to old telephoto lenses technology advancements in coatings show here the most modern primes not as much but there are exceptions everywhere you have modern primes that are sharp as hell but offer lousy bokeh old primes that are fantastic overall lenses but flare like crazy modern zooms that have fantastic bokeh but are not sharp there are endless possibilities once you know what youre looking for you will be able to decide on your own  iso is different story for best images youre always shooting at lowest iso even for night low light photography you shoot lowest iso use tripod then extend shutter time you go for higher isos when you arent as interested in best quality top end stuff is always shot at base iso cams are in fact optimized for that base iso there are extremely rare cases where a cam will have two base isos gh5s is in fact only one that i know and its niche camera designed for video everything else are extension isos  it appears to me youve read a lot on the stuff but are quite ignorant on how it all comes together id advise you on buying some very cheap option first some used dslr or mirrorless kit then spend half a year on it youll invest little in system so youll easily be able to drop it and move to something else when you figure more precisely what to expect from other options sales like this arent doing much for prices you wont find a killer deal prices drop all the time and you can get quality used gear for fairly cheap
  youd be hard pressed to notice a difference in real image quality between a rebel xti ca 2006 and the latest greatest t6i or 7d mark ii or nikon d7500 or sony a6500 etc  observably false the newer processing power in the newer bodies means that those higher isos are actually usable as well a t2i will have significantly more noise than a t7i at all iso levels
  faggot i can tell those are different lenses but i can also tell when unsharp mask has been used
  my stupid parents  fucking kys kiddo
  can we get some photo comparisons this is also another obsession of mine i want to take photos where the color of a wall in the background stays the same for the entire distance but i always fuck that upeven on low iso it seemsand i cant figure out what else im doing wrong    another question ive got in mind if    is paying attention to yous  is there any nuance to buying a highend/professional camera from pre10 versus buying a baselevel camera from today what were the big boy features like before and how are they now
    cant wait till this retard replied to you with haha i was merely pretending xd
  for comparisons just go to 500px and search for the camera models youre interested in then realize that the people who spend more on a camera are likely to care more about the craft so theres going to be a skill gap then realize you should only be comparing image quality then youll realize the body makes literally no difference for any modern dslr in terms of raw image quality if you can control the situation through lighting tripod for long shutterspeed etc an older pro body will produce worse results than a modern entrylevel body because of the processors used these processors matter far more for things like noise performance than just the size of the sensor or how many megapickles it has a rebel t6 for 300 and a 2470 f/28 lens for 1600 will give you better results than a 5d mki with an 1855mm f/3556 will
  can i just save as raw in older photos and then postprocess them to reduce noise or does the camera have some knowledge it doesnt impart to the raw file that is used in noise suppression
  one should not forget that modern sensors have a much higher dynamic range making shadow recovery much better and often hdr bracketing obsolet  not so important if you can control the enviroment like with studio work but it shows with anything else  film has more dr than those earlier sensors but nowadays this gap closed and digital even surpassed it regarding low light
  the question becomes how can i cheat the system and get entry level modern cameras for half price  i have infinite patience
  thank you for your kind words please tell me what id gain from cheating on something like that images are from one of my personal aperture test shot its 11 center crop on high contrast scene so sharpness differences are more pronounced i did not use any sharpening on the samples i left cr and lens corrections on since i was only looking at comparing sharpness      proper tests are hard work actually slightly missed focus will fuck everything up when youve everything on sturdy tripod youll maybe bump it a little when changing lenses and itll make a difference not only that even lens dimensions effect samples with two 50mm lenses one lens being slightly longer than the other will effect its field of view from same camera position always take any test with a grain of salt youd need to take care of too many variables for perfect field comparisons  hard to define differences between cameras id say biggest advancements were made in auto focus section both in speed and accuracy picture resolution high iso performance and dynamic range also went up considerably but id have to give it to one anon who said that you should not see huge differences in end picture youll maybe need to work more on older equipment but its entirely possible to duplicate everything we have indeed reached a ceiling where tech returns are diminishing its something manufacturers and gearheads will try to fight but proofs will always be images from the past
  a rebel t6 for 300 and a 2470 f/28 lens for 1600 will give you better results than a 5d mki with an 1855mm f/3556 will  i mean thats certainly true since you cant mount the 1855 on a 5d p
  i would never expect to find a used lens in mint condition

  i strongly recommend the nikon d300 for its capabilities it beats the shit out of d5000/d3000     the tradeoff is that d300 doesnt have video capabilities dont listen to the retards bitching about its being too old and having only 12megapixels because they clearly dont understand what pixelpitch/pixel density even is    if you dont plan on cropping too much this is my top recommendation for beginners if you really need video and want to crop a little more get the d7000 instead which is slightly expensive    make sure before buying the camera need to have fair amount of actuations i recommend under 80000 clicks
canon d850t3 iii with the pentax 10600mm f/09512 and sigma art 6000mm macro f/075 is great for beginners

  boomers hate film nigga
  crank the winder  hear the film tear out of the canister  rollei 35 is a mean bitch never happened to me with any other camera but already twice with this thing
  i have plugins that automate frequency separation set up the layers foe dodge and burn luminosity masks etc i 100 can do these things by myself but why would i waste 56min on each photo i have to retouch     oh well i took the bait again      well i process my raws with capture one so i wouldnt know      of course you dont get it were on /p/
  grow a backbone you work in a club where alcohol and emotions run freely  assert yourself tell them youre meant to be here flash an official badge or something insist you can get them banned for fucking with employees even if its a bluff dont make it about yourself take selfdefence courses if need be    noone cares if theyre in the wrong point is you essentially cried for mommy and that makes you look like that weak faggot with the camera theyre going to make the butt of a joke about to their buddies forever no wonder the club is reluctant to do anything about it because theyre in the fucking vip section which translates as responsible for 50 of their business that night    be smart when working you cant expect a defenseless young woman to dress provacatively in a bad neighborhood will come out without a scratch adapt to your fucking environment or find a different gig like baby showers or weddings
  last time a guy harassed me while i was working i gave his picture to the officers as a girl was charging a file about sexual harassment    i know it ended up fine to him but to have the police going after him for a supposed rape was marvellous the guy was afraid as fuck     he never went there after this

pedophile wannabe scam artists who use bots on instagram to build a fake audience really piss me off
  why    also theyre not fake followers
  chosis you need to fuck off
  yes they are fake followers the only followers youre getting are people running the same bot as you which is why you get maybe 4 comments every post if that and they all look automated nobody cares about your photography in the slightest    heres alex burke for comparison organic and steady growth with 4x the engagement not pits and valleys of hammering away with a fucking bot like a desperate bitch
  what website is this
  hypeauditor
  what do you even know how bots work you arent gathering fake followers all youre doing is liking and following/unfollowing other users which make it more likely that theyll look at your ig and follow you if they were bots they would unfollow you in a day and would not count towards your follower count so how are you understanding this differently    ive been running an engagement bot for a little over a year now and seen nothing but good come from it
  so someone who has followed and unfollowed over 20k profiles since july 2018 has only marginally better growth than someone who went from 125 to 175 followings in the same period     sounds
  sounds like an incredibly valuable service
  marginally better ive gained 5k followers since july id guess that qualifies as better than marginal i personally dont see whats wrong with it following and unfollowing someone if they like your photos they can follow you if they dont they ignore you
  this mentality only works if you delude yourself into thinking everyone youre following/unfollowing isnt using the exact same bot as you which is why hypeauditor flags it as possible inauthentic audience you get in a feedback loop of people using the same bot as you with all the shallow and fake engagement that brings with it     in the end what matters is engagement and chosis has almost none compared to alex burke barely anybody comments on his work nobody buys his prints and despite having 6k follows he got none of it legitimately that means his audience is inauthentic other than as a number on his profile he can delude himself into thinking is real
  im talking about those two charts despite chosis following and unfollowing over 6k people in the last four weeks alone he only gained 206 followers compared to alex who gained 105 doing none of that desperate shit
  you still dont understand what youre claiming is that almost all of the followers gained are through other people following and unfollowing like you so if thats the case wouldnt that mean that your growth would also disappear because those people would unfollow you thats what youre not understanding about bots youre not buying bots you are the bot this isnt buying fake followers its engaging with real people     also how would it work that because you use a bot all of the sudden now only other bots are seeing your work the same people that see alexs stuff see my stuff    in the end what matters is engagement and chosis has almost none compared to alex burke    well good thing im not chosis chosiss photos suck ass i have good engagement on my photos my images average over 1200 likes each some even getting as high as 5k likes other than automating my account ive never purchased followers or likes
  some people have different motivations though alex is a great photographer and a nice guy hes in a great position that hes done the work that he can now make a living off photography which allows him to always be out and taking photos to post on ig people like me on the other hand i can only make a couple photo trips a year i work inside all day so i just dont have the ability right now to post constant new content
just the whole constantly fighting instagram for any kind of exposure is annoying it would be fine it if was honest growth and not some algorithm you are always fighting i just want to share my shit and it get natural responses no spam comments and no jumping through hoops just so that i feel like someone can at least see it
  why would they unfollow you if you follow them first through your bot if the only thing theyre craving is bigger numbers on their account why would their or your bot even unfollow someone who already has the desired outcome following them/you surely if you follow someone and their automated account follows you back then thats the end of it thats why i was talking about a potential feedback loop of everyone autoliking autocommenting and autofollowing each other    im not saying all the people who get hit by a follow bot are also using bots im sure some check out your profile and think wow how cool ill give it a follow im just saying it comes across as desperate and since chosis has repeatedly lied that hes never used a bot before its hilarious to see proof that he is especially in light of all his other proven lies lately
  surely if you follow someone and their automated account follows you back then thats the end of it  thats just not how it works my bot doesnt just follow people back it targets people very precicesly     for example i could target any user that follows alexburke and has been active in the last 10 days     or i could target any user that has commented or liked a specific photo that alex burke has posted     i can whittle it down even further ensuring they are following under a certain amount of people so i target users that are following under 300 accounts to ensure that i fill a larger percentage of their feed    so its not just randomly following people that are following me thats absurd its targeting users that have a very high potential to like my stuff because theyve already qualified themselves by following a similar account    fun fact i have targeted alexburkes followers before
  food and booze doesnt pay my rent
  you people make me sick how about using instagram for its intended use follow real people you actually like content of like content you see and post more content consistently  you form part of the reason online experiences lose their appeal and feel hollow
  they make everybody sick anon bear in mind theyre normally paying monthly for the privilege of automating their account with some chink bot and you start to see how far the social media narcissism rabbit hole goes
  wrong i paid a one time fee to purchase the program and ive been running it for a couple years now and i run 3 accounts at the same time on it
  to what end
  i thought youve been running it for a little over a year now   not a couple of years now    you really struggle to keep your story straight eh chris
  i forgot how much time has passed since i started it but it has actually been a couple years and no im not chosis

this is what amateur modeling in my area is like portland here  go to your city and post the worst
  looks like a porn shoot but otherwise whats wrong with it
  except for how stupid it looks
  portland  how come she doesnt have a dozen tattoos and piercings
  i want to be crushed by those thighs
  this is actually really good
when you tell your overweight model to walk into a fountain stream in heels and spread them legs    seriously wtf
  portland  fat feminist dykes trying to smash the patriarchy  if they look as ugly as they are on your photos its your fault
  its fucking garbage my dude
casper wyoming
  lol in what way the pose is fucking horrendous the facial expression looks like shes waiting for a bus the shutter speed isnt slow enough for the water to flow smoothly or fast enough to freeze it so its just a bunch of blurry bullshit

i like it she has nice feet
    and he now looks like he has downs
  is it a bad sign that im more annoyed by the unaesthetic motion blur of the water
  are you that same guy who was complaining about long exposure waterfalls the other day
  no  actually more motion blur would be fine its just this intermediate stuff i cant stand this photographer and model are at exactly the same level

how does one get into the whole modelling/erotic photography/pornshoot scene anyway    does one as the photographer essentially buy the girls time and sell the photos back   is it the other way around so the girl feels she needs a new set of photos to market and hires a photographer  or is it the girls agent if available that brokers a deal and photoshoot date/costs between girl and photographer    also is it the photographers job to provide location and props and tell the model what to do and how to pose is there a give  take relationship or does the girl often know what exactly she wants/brings her own props  spiel    work perks
  could be set up any way usually the photographer had a series they want to take and hires models sometimes a model wants a set of erotic/nude/boudoir photos for their own portfolio and they hire a photographer     work perks  no you will immediately be blackballed by every model in your local area
  nothing a little processing cant fix  except that fucking horse face
  theres pretty much no redeeming quality to it i mean theres no huge problems with exposure but thats about all it has going for it the focus color composition framing pose and editing are all horrendous
  leave mr ed alone  
    thats not the models fault
  you will be labeled as the creeper you are
  the pose and the ugly expression is
  splittoning hair was a mistake
  he doesnt know how to pose a model  spot the fag whos never taken a portrait
  you are making no sense
  bless you anon
  moist
  white knuckling that chair so he doesnt fall over
  just goes to show how little you know
  a bad pose and ugly expression in a finished photo are the photographers fault     even if the model chose that pose and expressionand generally a photoshoot will be a collaboration between the photographer and model if they both have any amount of skill/experience so thats very likelya good photographer will suggest a less ugly look or at least not select that pose during the culling phase of editing     the only way this responsibility doesnt fall on the photographer is if the model and photographer had an agreement where shed get the shots to do her own editing which is possible     not sure why that guy youre arguing with couldnt have just said that instead of posting vague and unhelpful attacks like im on his side in this argument and it took a bit of head scratching to figure out what the hell he was trying to say
  photographer took an unattractive girl and made her look cheap and ugly    where have i seen this before

  youre agreeing with me so im confused as to why you started that with nah
  she actually seems to have a nice figure but everything else about this photo is hot garbage
  she has no personality
  you cant fix a shit model
  she looks like when i come home and my girlfriend has been stewing about some shit i said last month

  looks like phone camera shot
  i want to see a black light test on that backdrop
    id still fuck    if she is over 18 with those braces        
  fucking yikes
  listen up and listen carefully up my man all you need is a cup
  its a dslr hes been going at it for 5 years now and adds multiple albums of shoots every week yet somehow he is still in the same place he started off in  it goes without say that all the girls he shoots are wannabe models that nobody else ever wants to shoot
  id shoot her shes not so bad and a little shoop can go a long way
  id still fuck    back to your containment boards    
  how does one get into the whole modelling/erotic photography/pornshoot scene anyway  those are two questions with two different answers    how does one get into the whole erotic pornshoot scene anyway  pay sluts to meet you for photoshoots and/or for sex  how does one get into the whole modelling photography scene anyway  establish a portfolio and/or contact models offering your rates    if youre hiring sluts youll get shitty results which is why they tend to be paired with shitty photographers      a bad pose and ugly expression in a finished photo are the photographers fault  entirely dependent upon whos paying some models are so bad theyre genuinely difficult to take good pictures of if she posts them then thats fine if i post them then thats my mistake      this for example is aboslutely the fault of the photographer being uncomfortable or insecure as a model is 99/100 times because of the photographer even more so when its shot
  i feel so bad for her imagine some shitty guy tricking you into thinking he can get you a modeling career and he comes up with this shit imagine what this shoot was like    okay umm can you take your clothes off now    must have been uncomfortable as fuck
m
  fucking yikes m8 looks like the back end of a muscular horse or some shit
  nothing a little processing cant fix  actually fixes nothing and somehow makes it worse this is bait right
  aside from the angle i dont mind this at all with some tweaking it could be the cover for some shitty indiefolk album
  crap jawline  crack whore expression  terrible hair  flabby boobs  terrible skin  and this

  the normalization of whoredom in the past decadethe kardashians and others  grandma get off of 4chan you know it just gets you angry and if you yell at any more nurses theyre going to kick you out of the home

  lmao well done
with these stipulations in mind    lr ps  can be pirated and setup in 10 minutes fullfeatured not an express version  seamless integration with each other  potentially shittier raw processing     c1  superior processing  doesnt really integrate into anything possibly affinity but not as seamlessly as lrps  express version free but raised price on pro version to 200 usd which means 250 if converted to other currencies    i was going to stick with c1 but them raising their prices for sony users from 6075 to 200 last month kicked me in the sack most of the arguments against lr seem to be that it just isnt quite as good as c1 at processing raws and that adobes subscription model is stupid but is lr/ps combo better if lr is 90 as good as c1  but is free
i use dxo photolab
not once in history has someone looked at an otherwise good photo and said damn if only youd edited the raw file for this in capture one instead of adobe this shot would be perfect
  ive had instances where christmas lights if they were not in focus would all be blue and jagged if processed in lr taken on an a6000 i was new at the time and so i thought i had broken my camera until i brought the images into c1 and they turned out as i took them in my camera
  only the sith deal in absolutes
  the same could be said the other way around     i like the workflow of capture one over lr
  what do you mean doesnt integrate you can do roundtrip edits from c1 to ps and back to c1 again but holy crap thats a steep price increase so im glad to already have pro express is honestly quite lacking compared to pro in my experience
  i got busy all of a sudden and looked at their website and saw that they increased prices in my country essentially over 5x i was shocked and tried googling about this and saw very little outrage perhaps more professionals use c1 and they dont really give a fuck because they already had pro for like 60     if i knew i was bound to c1 i would just pony up the price but rumor is that c1 is going to start incorporating stacking panos etc i would fucking hate to invest 250 into the pro12 then another chunk into pro13 that has those features     youre right about the c1 integration with ps its not quite as seamless as with lr/ps but its good enough
  yeah i guess this is their move now that theyve tied more users due to sony price feels like c1 has gotten a lot of word of mouth and adtime going so now as interest increases so does prices i hope updates wont cost a fortune
  the same could be said the other way aroun  and is equally true     my point was that if you prefer the workflow of one over the other use that one because image quality differences are going to be a nonissue in practice
which is better for developing film scans i would switch to c1 but idk if i can bring my presets and widgets over from lightroom i dont use photoshop much anyway
  if you shoot fuji c1 is supieror in everyway images are almost twice as sharp colours much nicer detail isnt all shitted over by whatever lr does to raf files heres some examples not mine btw i havent used it for anything other than fuji but id deffo urge people to atleast try it once you get used the software its much nicer to use than lr    
i prefer lr currently because i rely on the plugins and some of the presets for my workflow it also integrates in with everything else i use smoothly    when i tried c1 none of my plugins worked it seems like a really powerful editor on its own but i have a workflow im used to and it wont allow me to bring an equivalent of that into c1 i know i could adapt and change my editing completely to compensate but it isnt worth it to me    some really cool features in c1 though i still liked it
  fucking this    it makes me physically cringe when i see world renowned photographers use the default adobe color profile    fuck adobe for trying to force their way into the industry standard scene by shoving proprietary technologies that arent even any good i would be more forgiving if they actually had good colors but alas adobe is just butthurt that no one surrendered to the shitty license feeridden dng format so now adobe is backstabbing every camera manufacturer who isnt shooting raw as dng by applying adobe color profile by default in lightroom etc which destroys colors
  so what should i do to avoid this if my wf includes lightroom oh wait if im shooting canon it dont matter none right
  its a raw file you can change the colours however you want they rapidly change the second you touch any setting unless youre doing fuck all other than exporting it straight out as a jpg after loading it into lr with zero editing i dont see the issue the colour profiles are just a base to start from
  yes because you should choose your editing workflow based on how well it handles blue leds
  hahaa the one on the right is exactly what it looked like this super blue/purple bokeh with these giant fucking onion rings in the middle when none were present in the original photo     i had some pirated version of lr6xx and i wanted nothing to do with lr after that did they fix that shit in later versions eg classic 8    why people defend adobe is beyond me
  did they fix that shit in later versions eg classic 8    lolno it has probably been like that forever the first photoshop version that i used was cs5 released in 2010 or something same shit still happens in photoshop cc 2019 released a couple of weeks ago both lr and ps use adobe camera raw as raw editor latest version is 11
  most of the arguments against lr seem to be that it just isnt quite as good as c1 at processing raw    its not that lr isnt as good at processing raw files its that c1 makes certain decisions about how it handles raw files upon import that some people find more appealing from the getgo than lr ive used both professionally i can get the same edits i want out of both programs its just slightly different routes to get there     i stick with lr because i prefer the workflow and the cataloging is superior i have a sports photographer friend with hundreds of thousands of frames were talking 30 years worth of work and he says he tried c1 but it just cant handle the sheer volume of files my former photojourno colleagues all say the same thing as for me i dont have the same volume of photos as these guys but i trust them     as for pricing i dont hate adobes subscription model i get lr classic plus ps on my computer and lr on my phone for 10 per month or 120 per year thats way cheaper than the old days
  does the matter if you use iridium first
darktable  org
  its easy to spot the adobextrans files i was choosing images for a photo exhibition and i had to remove most of the fuji images for being way too watercoloury for printing at 50x70
  i wouldnt touch a mac if someone paid me
  the colour profiles are just a base to start from  the sheer ignorance of adobe shills makes me fucking exhausted
  it doesnt work proper on windows you dont get a live image preview of the adjustments being made so your basically swinging a bat in the dark and the developer has said he doesnt have any plans on doing a full complete port beyond the cruddy one hes half assed to make some gibs
the free c1 fuji version does literally everything i could ever want
anyone knows if its possible to save and overwrite original files in c1 ive logistical nightmare with shit ton of useless tiffs working c1 to ps and reverse
  does c1 have a decent library sorting/storing feature like lr    anyone actually use darktable  fucking around on a linux distro and this showed up as an available photo editor
  i remember checking on dartable years ago at it was just a very simplified lightroom got a new installation now and it came a long way there is some stuff in it that you cant find anywhere else biggest problem with it is that its become more complicated than lr and i cant find the time to go and learn it all its definitely a viable alternative to both lr and captureone
  adobe btfo you shit shill program op youve been posting these threads for what over a month now lol pathetic
  there is some stuff in it that you cant find anywhere else  such as
  i even made an effort and posted a screen to show one of them a lot of other stuff as well not that hard to find much harder figuring how they work for immediate wtf moment open up equalizer
    completely agreed the equalizer allows for example a processing that is aware of smooth surfaces and more disturbed structures and allows a differentiated editing based on this everytime i think its a good idea to use it on a photograph i fiddle with it for half an hour and then give up or look up a tutorial
how can i pirated lr
  is this sonyonly issue i dont remember ever seeing this on canons raws will check though i just dont have any blue leds or lights anywhere in here
want to cancel photoshop subscription and torrent it for free instead  will be charged a cancellation fee of 80 bucks as a final fuck you from adobeshit    can i just cancel my credit card instead
    just put a freeze on it you dont need to cancel also you usually can manage recurring payments through the card and the bank will tell them to stop all charges
   will be charged a cancellation fee of 80 bucks as a final fuck you from adobeshit  is this true  is this fucking true
  yes you would think that the european union would ban these extortion tactics but nope
  fuck they must have some yearly clause in the contract when you sign up for it
    i heard the 2019 version hasnt been cracked yet
can i use my lr presets in the free sony version of c1
  yeah if you cancel at the end of the cycle youre not charged anything you pay 120 for a year in truth not 10 a month
  wtf this is a scam
  ive read that amtlib is missing in some cc apps
  you heard wrong it was the first one cracked i think all of them are by now im still on old lr but 2019 ps got some nice tools so i went to it quickly
lr thinks it is professional photography software  cant even get sharp photos    
do any of these support sigma merrill raw images natively the way affinity photo does
  i know lightroom wont touch em
  using french gimmicky software  dude
  are you fucking retarded its not supposed to make photos look better its supposed to make your processing workflow easier
  god tier /p/ memeing right there sir
did some traveling this month to meet up with extended family/friends snapshitted along the way enjoy or dont     will take me a while to process the whole lot so ill chip away and post gradually    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makeleica camera agcamera modelm9 digital cameracamera softwareadobe photoshop lightroom 614 macintoshmaximum lens aperturef/10imagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20181124 181044exposure time1/125 secfnumberf/40exposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating320lens aperturef/40exposure bias0 evmetering modecenter weighted averagelight sourceunknownflashno flashcolor space informationsrgbexposure modemanualwhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardunique image id000000000000000000000000000091ef

best books about color in photography
  colour by time life books  ignore the filmisnotdead book its utter trash
color theory in photography isnt distinct from color theory in all other 2d arts so i would broaden your perspectives and look for books written about painting design etc
get to know your farbkreis and consider things like why portra has yellow highlights and blue shadows what causes chromostereopsis how this relates to image contrast in general    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwaregoogleimagespecific propertiesimage created20181126 073630image height999image width1000
anybody know how to achieve the highend surreal look you see in a lot of higherend fashion and portrait photography
bro just make it super high contrast blackest blacks whitest whites if youre really feeling adventurous put a black and white filter on it instant award
are those lads faggots why is they holding hands
    this is wrong though you can just literally look at the photo he posted and tell that this is wrong
    just boys being bad boys
  gels good lighting and models who know where the light is
  how  hair light back light spot light key light fill light strobe flash diffuser honeycomb grid beauty dish barn door
    this and your old friends dodge and burn
whos one of the greatest photographers of all time and why is it gordon parks
  cant you really notice how he carefully framed his shots its not like today people hold the shutter release button in continuous and hope they capture the moment
  his compositions are literally perfect the only photographer whos compositions even come close i think are joel meyerowitz and garry winogrand
  cant we appreciate a photographer without going into a rant about how kids these days cant into photography
  nohting wrong with a bit of conversation      its not like today people hold the shutter release button in continuous and hope they capture the moment    not all the time
  this photo struck me the most
  keep going
  cliché picture desu
    ok this kind of photo i have never seen    this one struck me
  cringe
  what format are these 4x5
  what format are these 4x5  images are 11 aspect
  i wouldnt say hes the best but hes in that highest tier of photographers for sure very good at framing crowds and people in general thats by far his best skill
  cropping is impossible
  cropping  do you really think a master would crop every single image to 11 he uses a rolleiflex and a nikon f
  i had no idea who he was and happened to be in an art museum where a bunch of his work was posted the shots look glorious live
  cant you really notice how he carefully framed his shots    his compositions are literally perfect    since he clearly had only a narrow window of time to get his shot in some of them would have benefitted from a zoom lens or a little cropping     literally  department of redundancy departmentjpg
  zoom
  wouldnt go anywhere without them
  thats why youre not gordon parks lmao
  didnt say i was nor did i say i wanted to be id rather be myself
considering the fact that this style is everywhere on ig after 70 years his influence is everywhere and now i know from where all these color contemporary photogs took their inspiration from    yeah i can say that hes one of the goats
  i enjoy his shots but this one rubs me the wrong way it feels forced and unnatural still like it nonetheless
meh they are okay they look good because they are old  is good but there is nothing particularly special about the others

  ok
  the importance of his photography is his subject matter and what it portrays not the technical stuff like color or composition although the composition matters for sure

last month of 2018 out of ideas /p/
rolling for 03
  dammit jumped the gun
roll
  are we suppose to post photos weve already taken or go out and take them
  i think out of ideas implies that you go out and take it but its not like anyone will actually care if you post something you already have
  but its not like anyone will actually care if you post something you already have  i always see these threads have heaps of roll replies but maybe like 10 photos actually in the thread why dont people just post photos theyve already taken

  that comic  reminds of the northrups who think that phone cameras have surpassed dslrs in sharpness and that the depth mapping is superior to physical depth of field shot on a wide aperture lens and larger depth of field
  the high quality comes from the photographer not the camera  you are perfectly fine starting out with a modern smartphone like sumireko actually   starting out you want to focus on learning about and practicing composition and lighting and choosing the subject of course you dont need a fancy camera or expensive film for that and film really is pretty expensive to shoot these days why not get your first few thousand photos on nice cheap digital and then graduate to film when you know enough about photography to know how to not waste 99 frames out of a hundred    and no you dont need high zoom either nothing wrong with using a kit lens with some zoom capability but composition is a lot more about choosing an angle than a magnification
why not lurk for more than 1 one day before posting another one of these threads theres gear advice for beginners all the time multiple threads like this are still active on this board right now yet you want people to rewrite all that information again just for you because you cant be bothered to lurk or look at other threads no thanks i dont help the mentally handicapped
  fuck it im just going to copy and paste what i told the last guy who wanted to buy a super zoom bridge camera    whoever told you to buy a bridge camera is an idiot theyre clueless boomer tier a phone camera stuffed in a pointlessly bulky body if you want noticeably better images than your phone you need a 1 sensor and above the bigger the sensor the more depth of field you can create blurred backgrounds and your low light performance will also improve with each step up the sensor ladder    i started out with a used sony nex 5n and kit lens  adapted vintage lenses the nex line is the same as the current day sony a6000 they renamed to sony alpha from nex at some point     get a cheap mirrorless like that canon m sony nex nikon 1 fuji xe2/xpro 1 anything released past 2011 will be fine for a beginner pick up some vintage prime lenses from thrift shops and adapters from china a vintage 50mm f18 prime is cheap and plentiful an m42 mount adapter will serve you well as it opens you up to a huge world of cheap russian  japanese glass     lenses  camera bodies in terms of importance to the quality of your images invest in glass as much as you can as it really matters to your images camera bodies come and go but good lenses will stay with you    if you want an allinone solution grab a sony rx100 iii fujifilm x100s or lumix lx100 first gen anything with a 1 sensor and up will be worth it long term
  an oldschool film camera can be considered to have nearinfinite image resolution higher quality images for those who are passionate
  the high quality comes from the photographer not the camera  no its definitely the camera
  can you post a link to where they said that ive seen many other their videos and ive never heard them even imply something like that
  can be considered to have nearinfinite image resolution  and you can be considered to have brain damage
 op  hello /p/ i want to try my hand on photography though i am debating whether i should buy a digital camera especially one of the high zoom models  only autists use telephoto lenses and only pajeets use digital zoom   i had a group of people telling me that analog photography has a level of quality that digital photography will never attain  yeah thats lies digital sensor size and quality has finally completely overtaken film in every way plus a decent photographer with when a low level dslr will destroy some chud with a film camera that they dont know how to use
  i dont get pic related
  some newb isnt going to be passionate enough for film yet     /fgt/ is full of these gormless hipsters who go out and buy a nice film camera because of the meme they then start whining when they have to develop their rolls or scan the negatives so they send them to a lab out of laziness and get raped on prices then whine about that instead     film is great in my opinion but you should only get into it if youre willing to really invest in it with knowledge research time and money mostly in chemicals and eventually negative storage
  refute me nigger
  an oldschool film camera can be considered to have nearinfinite image resolution higher quality images for those who are passionate  im not the guy you asked to refute you but i agree that just telling you a moron is not a good response to that what works a lot better is proving mathematically that youre a moron    first off there is the matter of lenses lenses very much do not have infinite resolution their resolution is entirely finite and a lot of modern dslrs are reaching sensor resolutions that outstrip some lens resolutions since film cameras use lenses just like digital cameras just from this we can show that the film cannot possibly give you infinite resolution here is the wikipedia article on optical resolution for some more background and proof     but thats not all even if lenses could give you infinite resolution the film itself very much cannot give you infinite resolution the active part of a film emulsion is a tiny grain of silver halide which can be either exposed or not exposed thus obviously the resolution of film cant possibly be more than the number of grains in the emulsion but thats just the startany individual grain can only be exposed or not exposed there is no in between if a grain is exposed it turns black on the negative if the grain is not exposed it does not so to create the image it takes many grains to make a shade of gray its even worse with color film since the exposed grains get replaced with cyan magenta or yellow dye so you need a bunch of little dots of color to make up a different shades    so theres an absolute hard resolution limit of the grains and a much lower resolution limit of actual image detail besides a pure blackonwhite line that could theoretically be represented by a line of single grains and both of those are further limited by the resolution coming out of the lens itself
  ctd  and of course those resolution limits depend heavily on the type of film youre shooting with higher iso film being much lower resolution because the way they increase sensitivity in film is largely to increase the size of the grains which naturally decreases the films theoretical resolution limits this is why high iso film is described as grainy    so far far from having nearinfinite image resolution in practice youll find that the resolution you can get out of a film camera is roughly the same as what you get out of a lowend 2018 dslr there are of course some crazy highresolution films black and white very low iso that can still beat out digital in pure line pairs per millimeter on a test chart and large format film is still the king if you want really insane resolution but its ridiculous to say that film has near infinite resolution it doesnt its very finite its very measurable its not even that impressively high
      tldr weeb shit
does /p/ have a board tan
    every board has a tan
  why is ours so ugly
  at least were not /hr/
  and film really is pretty expensive to shoot these days    see i actually think this is a bit misleading yes film is much more expensive if youre shooting it like digital  aka taking fucking a million photos of everything you come across i actually think film is the cheaper option if youre just interested in trying out photography like op is but arent sure if its for you    you can get an old minolta film camera a decent 50mm lens and a few rolls of film for like 100 thats enough to try out the hobby and see if you like it learn about exposure and shit on a camera that doesnt have any auto settings so you actually need to learn it     its a way lower barrier to entry than a digital camera where even used youre looking at 300400 for a decent body  lens that isnt garbage thats a lot of money to spend on something you may not even wind up enjoying    you could maybe say if you wind up falling in love with the hobby its better to get a digital first since then you can go hog wild with shooting but chances are op has no fucking clue what to look for in a camera anyways or what they would personally enjoy in a camera so a cheap film kit can help them figure out what they might want in a digital one
  i had a group of people telling me that analog photography has a level of quality that digital photography will never attain  this is delusion high end digital cameras and camcorders have several stops more dynamic range more color depth and higher resolution than even the finest grain films noise performance is also significantly better you can easily get usable shots at iso12800 with digital but commercial color film doesnt really exist above iso1600 and even though you can push film a stop or two its never going to even come close to the kind of quality you get from digital   unless you shoot large format with plenty of light digital is going to be better in every way you can emulate the filmic look in post if you really want to although the whole point of digital is a that it doesnt have an innate look
  its a way lower barrier to entry than a digital camera where even used youre looking at 300400 for a decent body  lens that isnt garbage  counterpoint you can get an older model dslr like a canon 20d for around 60 plus a kit lens for around 50 theyre garbage by the jet packtraveling mooncolonyliving laserrobotdogowning standards of today but they blow away film cameras in terms of usability and technical niceties and its a system he could grow into if he discovers he really likes photography    compare with an old film camera basically free plus film which will cost you at least ten bucks a roll when you include developing so the digital gets cheaper after about 400 photos     i dont think 400 photos is enough to determine whether or not a hobby is for you especially since youre less likely to give photography a real shot if you start on film because youll be hearing that little cash register noise with every shutter click and thatll make you experiment less and have less fun
  this plus developing film and all that might put a newbie off unless hes into that have a minolta from my brother glad i started out with a d3100 instead and that was a pretty good deal for a hundred plus bucks
  heres the thing a 35mm film slr will always give you better results until you learn how to make a digital file look as good and see  for the caveat  it took me most of 4 years to achieve this myself and i had to shoot back to back film and digital to do it i did waste a lot of time someone more focussed wouldnt need that long  digital ends up being better but only if you know what youre doing and only above a certain price/quality threshold
  if youre bothered reading the rest of the post youd have noticed the part about the first few thousand photos instead of wasting your time writing all that shit
  bs its true good pictures come from photographer but a camera with a proper real lenses with adjustable shutter aperture is a must      buy p900/p1000 so even if you dont like photography you can take high resolution pictures of birds from far away
    fine ill fix it what kind of camera should he be using
  a rangefinder
  brand/era
  leica m3 w/ 35mm and dont forget a lens hood
  right back later
    i was able to tell in definitely less than 4001000 shots that id love photography but ill give you that a primitive dslr will be just as cheap as a film camera so yeah i concede there
  /p/ may deny it but shes right phone cameras are the future
  so long as you understand
  its not about whether you like it or not you idiot  its about the practice and practice especially nowadays means taking a shitload of photos thats cheaper on digital  and you get to see the result right awaym which makes it easier to try out different things and settings to see what works
  wrong
  wrong
  its not about whether you like it or not you idiot  its about the practice  how does it feel to be a try hard
  is trying hard a bad thing now
  you are perfectly fine starting out with a modern smartphone like sumireko actually    in fact you become a sellout the moment you denigrate yourself enough to need a standalone camera in the first place the highest calling of any photographer is to document people getting bludgeoned in the face you can do this with an iphone or anything    if a riot doesnt start for your express benefit every time you pull a camera out your ass pocket then youre a hack fraud anyway      you can get an old minolta film camera a decent 50mm lens and a few rolls of film for like 100    fuck that for 100 you can buy a container of gasoline several rolls of toilet paper and still have enough left over for a picket fence    learn about exposure    if you really want to learn about exposure get a pin a cardboard box and some tracing paper and make your own pigeonhole camera all this crap about lenses and geometry is just a masturbatory fetish    some of these goddamn punks have taken literally thousands upon thousands of photos of stuff not blowing up if this is you and your whole artistic process involves nothing and you need to take a critical look at yourself beyond your hack fraud leading lines
  always been a bad thing
  analog is better because we got all of our classic photo by them
  listen to this man he knows his stuff
  you can take high resolution pictures of birds from far away  spotted the brit
    not an argument
    135 film is roughly equivalent to 16 megapixels with 12 stops of dynamic range there is some variance in film stocks but that is about the best you will get    there are other differences especially in how you expose for shadows instead of highlights but your final image wont be much better than that    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandcolor space informationsrgbimage width1000image height671
  i see thanks
  good lord why
  whether i should buy a digital camera especially one of the high zoom models  definitely dont buy one of those any camera with a built in superzoom lens is going to be pretty shitty    i had a group of people telling me that analog photography has a level of quality that digital photography will never attain  also dont listen to these people they are dumb idiots    1 for objective measures of quality digital already beats film at similar format sizes   2 for subjective measures of quality its entirely personal preference and theres no way to say one is definitively better than the other i always prefer the pictures i take on digital to the ones i take on film other people prefer their digital shots photography is an artistic medium so use whichever you prefer     fortunately you can get a decent film camera for like 5 and a roll of film for another 5 and get it developed for 10 and try it out and see if you like it just promise me that if you do like it you wont go around telling people that its objectively better than digital just because you enjoy it
  for shadows instead of highlights  you should do that on digital too digital sensors put noise into dark areas even if they arent clipped you should over expose as much as you can without blowing out the highlights as that will ensure you get dark detail without noise then just adjust the levels in post    if you expose for highlights then bring up the shadows in post you get more noise
  thats what exposing for the highlights means     expose for the highlights make sure the bright areas arent clipped and let the shadows fall where they may  expose for the shadows make sure the dark areas arent blocked out and let the highlights fall where they may

  id like to point out that in actuality film has fuckhojillions of potential photosites grain appears because of developer action causing development to bleed over into neighbouring silver bromide crystals so the perceived resolution of a black and white image outstrips roughly equivalent digital ie 68 mp for typical film because it renders things thatre beyond its practical line pair resolution    thats to say films resolution trails off gracefully into the grain digital turns into pixels and moire but digital does in the end deliver far more especially per mm2

  yes

  if youre a 27 year old virgin attempting to take nude photos of women you probably are going to try to rape them
  get laid first
  you hire models
  you hire escorts
  will they charge less if its just for modeling and not sex
  look for nude workshops
  no
  no but theyre cheaper than models at least here you can get some whore who probably has some std for 20 usd/hour models want 100/hour
  im a 27 year old virgin and i always act nervous around women btw  you didnt have to include this bit if you were interested in the photography only
  why do you want to shoot nudes in the first place
  escorts are like 500/hr where i live and theyre not really model material
  so he can jack his dinger to them later obviously
  why would you want to photograph some used up 3d whore theres beautiful landscape and architecture to shoot all over the place
  theres nothing more beautiful than the female form i dont even want to have sex with women i just want to use them create art
  to create art
    this or rub one out before you do        acceptable answer        really good answer since you are paying them for their time and services and you will probably actually get laid afterwards if thats what you are after op        this is also correct can be found on fakebook        why did weston and newton shoot noods women are pretty subjectoriented pictures are cruisecontrol for good        you must live in some liberal shithole or gambling state for 500 dollar an hour escorts        not everyone can be alex burke
  how do i get female models to pose nude for me without them thinking im going to rape them  a challenge  im a 27 year old virgin and i always act nervous around women btw  god mode
honestly take photos of them with their clothes on    if youre not a creep during those shoots doubtful theyll whip out a tiddy for future shoots
  in some liberal shithole  nyc so yeah
live in the new york area we found 27 hotties near you looking to fuck
you may be able to find some willing to do partial nude photos from a club or some risqué place pay them good though maybe supply a soft cloth or something to cover up some parts id recommend starting out like that first and build reputation     also start hanging out with gay guys and the customers think youre gay and be less awkward

i have been lurking on /p/ because i just like looking at photography so im a complete noob when it comes to the art of it but how the hell do you guys make your photos so good on a phone i have a samsung s9 but my photos dont look anywhere near as good as all of yours so my question is where do i start what do i install buy ect just to remind you guys i am a beginner and dont know shit
  honestly after 4 years of shooting mobile photography w/ shit phones and flagship phones i can say that you need to get your postprocessing skills up first  google how to turn raw shooting option on in your phone and learn how to process raw photos  also focus on composition/color theory/holding your hand without shaking so that the photos get maximum sharp and them everything will be ok  softwarewise snapseed for almost everything learn how to use curves thats a _must_   lightroom for hsl tool  vsco for occasional filter rarely also it doesnt support raw on android afaik    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera modelnexus 5camera softwaresnapseed 20maximum lens aperturef/24sensing methodonechip color areaimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage created20180125 044559exposure time10221/500000 secfnumberf/24exposure programnormal programiso speed rating228lens aperturef/24subject distance000 mmetering modecenter weighted averageflashno flashfocal length397 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width2402image height2402renderingcustomexposure modeautoscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormalsubject distance rangeunknown
last saturday i went in paris to shoot the ongoing protests    how did i do
last one for now    sorry about the lack of exif btw i couldnt be bothered to reexport them so i downloaded them from my flickr
  i like the postprocess
  looks like shit
mad photos bro contrast and angles are legit
really good you could try to sell them to the news outlets probably the raw files though let them do their own processing work
  nice photos op got any more
  never tried that desu usually i shoot landscapes and concerts so i wouldnt even know who to contact      sure heres the full set 
great work anon and good edit
  outlets almost dont buy raw files most of them want the basic jpg with a standard profile
    this ones dope others are shitty post processed
hope you have more really enjoying these      great choice in angle here    loving the contrast you really make it seem like its a daark time for paris     which lenses are you using  and could you post a photo before and after editing like have them side by side one of the photos with fire
  thanks     heres the same straight from capture one no edits    as for the lenses this one was shot with a canon 135l i only use prime lenses so all of those were done with either a 24 a 50 a 85 or a 135mm canon lens    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makecanoncamera modelcanon eos 5d mark iiicamera softwarecapture one pro 112 windowsimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiexposure time1/400 secfnumberf/25exposure programmanualiso speed rating800lens aperturef/25exposure bias0 evsubject distance000 mmetering modespotflashno flash compulsoryfocal length13500 mmimage width1000image height667renderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balanceautoscene capture typestandard
  let them do their own processing work  ive never run into a news publication or studio that does this never try to sell raws      this the less editing the better obviously ops stuff is edited to buggery and back that and the fact its presumably days after the event mean hes unlikely to get any news publication      personally i dont mind the instagrammy editing its perhaps a bit too extreme but it works for twilight shots and its consistently magenta and yellow/green with everything else removed    also like the consistency in things like reflections and framing good work not bastardizing the highlights although that may be due to photoshop
  yeah i did have a bit of a heavy editing on those compared to what i usually do but dunno i kinda like it that way     maybe ill look at these in a few months and think holy shit wtf was that post processing
these are pretty amazing
can you tell me what you saw when you were at paris    all the info i have is what i saw on the news i cant trust it very much
  rip twingo
  tv news is almost always biased in the same ways it focuses and slants towards carnage damage problems and disaster while avoiding or ignoring the reasons and leadup to what caused it to happen  generally speaking its also heavily edited to fit that agenda the reasons are many but the big two are government/company influence and the fact that danger and anger sell these two often conflict with each other    investigative journalism is all but dead these days so the best you can do is follow direct sources like twitter youtube etc and try to get stuff from two opposing sides and one in the middle    it blows my mind how people still think tv news is credible in 2018 but in the uk and us almost everything we get is filtered through the government men first and is often an outright lie  reddit is also often a surprisingly accurate and deep source of news if youre willing to spend a few minutes ignoring the headline
  honestly it wasnt all that bad    obviously there was quite some destruction by people either too angry or too dumb to stay calm mostly young people from the far right and the far left but the majority of protesters werent trying to break shit    same goes for the cops while ive seen some of them charging the protesters all of my interactions with the police went absolutely fine even when i ran into a patrol in an empty street with five cars burning in it    and while all the damage is a shame most of the french population still support the movement since theyre aware that its a small minority whos doing most of the damage
  yeah exactly they keep showing its all about fuel taxes saying how those people are just vandals and old fashioned this is very far from the reality i suppose but an inside view is good to understand whats really happening    t br riot guy
    it started with fuel taxes but its kinda more of a straw that breaks the camels back    first when macron got elected a lot of people me included didnt really vote for him but against his opponent marine le pen how she did get here is a long story basically both the big left and right parties fucked up    then he lowered taxes for the richest and followed with a few measures that made people talk about him as a president for the rich    so when he raised taxes on diesel fuel people felt it was unfair since   for years the government has been inciting people to buy cars with diesel engines and now they all lost a lot of their value   he could have raised the taxes on jet fuel or boat fuel since they both are less ecofriendly and used by the richest part of the country while a lot of poor people live in the countryside and have to use their car to do basically anything    a lot of people felt like he was disconnected from the reality of their lives and only thinks about the rich and/or those who live in large cities    so year although it did start with the fuel its way more than that    and as for the vandals as long as there are protests theres gonna be vandals some of those dont even care about the point of the protest they just like to smash things

looks good op im a terrible photographer though so i cant really tell if these are trash
  i like this one best of all that have been posted
  i think we needed to see a little more of the back hip       dont do kink shit you instantly are not showing appreciatation of a body but instantly slapping a sexual preference on to it that many can not relate to
  dont do kink shit you instantly are not showing appreciatation of a body but instantly slapping a sexual preference on to it that many can not relate to    god damn you are boring    dont listen to this guy do anything that comes into your mind
  dont do kink shit   grandma you know the nurses dont like you using the computer in the common area for 4chan if they catch you thatll be your third strike and youll have to go back to living in our attic and im sure as hell not going to pay to have an exterminator chase out all of the bats
  art isnt supposed to be like this
  im sexually objectifying you right now can you relate
  fucking your models  gross    most pics are really good body scapes though loving the low key style for this type or erotic shot
  this particular model has been my wife for the last 6 years i think sex with her is acceptable
  you are forgiven
  this particular model has been my wife for the last 6 years i think sex with her is acceptable  boomer
  why cover her face when everything else is shown
jesus christ this world is going to shit what exactly is the appeal in this type of photography shit just looks demonic and makes me uncomfortable go shoot some birds or mountains you fucking freak
  the fuck
  jesus christ this world is going to shit  there have literally been naked pictures of people since there have been cameras you massive dipshit
  i am horrified by the sight of human women
  im selftaught    that rope seems quite taut were you in the boy scouts
  yes so
  i have seen a few knot/rope videos over the years not my cup of tea but that seems well done i learned how to tie knots while sailing
  people having a bad reaction to this are creepers
  as far as i am as a person from the boy scout image i really enjoyed the practical learning you dont really learn anywhere else rope is definitely one of them my bf seems to like rope too
  ive been trying up women for about ad long ad ive been doing photography got gud by doing rescue work/ rock climbing    the style i do is rather amateurish for photography but thanks anyway
  can i use this pic in a school project
dumping some shibari inspo for you    personally i love this guys aesthetic  
  why cover her face when everything else is shown  seriously    its easy to identify someone by their face its hard to identify someone by their tits
  i love the lighting in this one also tits
      theres been nude imagery since the dawn of human abstract thought
  tell me more about the project and maybe i can send you a high res for it too      those are great  if youre on fl send me a request atomiccowboy
  well then they shouldnt do this type of photography if they know its something to be ashamed of   kink if lowest foarm its porn and porn alone
   its hard to identify someone by their tits   4u
  then there was this shitheel
  theres a difference between being ashamed of something and knowing that if youre identifiable people will actively use it to destroy your life     if you post your photo on 4chan and its identifiable there is a significant chance that someone will try to destroy your life just for fun its just part of the horrifying reality of modern life doesnt mean you shouldnt have fun taking artisticor even just straight up pornographicpictures if it makes you and the model happy to do so just means that it makes sense to not post them on 4chan where your face is identifiable     and before you respond that thats /b/ that does that not /p/ and they shouldnt be such scaredy cats i posted a thread here a while back where i forgot to strip the exif out of my photo my camera automatically adds copyright info someone doxxed me and was posting my flickr and instagram links before id uploaded the third picture 4chan is horrifying and coming here is akin to shooting up with a needle you found on the ground
  you are probably balls deep in the how do we solve the thots interested in photography thread
  um no sorry friend    i started reading but it got super boring by like the first post
  admits to being drawn to the subject of shaming sexual females while in a thread for sexual photography modeled by females
  assumes i read the first post in a thread because i agree with what is being said
  pro tip delete your name from your photo exif data next time you post on 4c
  i thought he did it on purpose like he lowkey wanted to be found
  i have in the past just forgot    if people wanna really be dicks i guess they can but w/e
  i guess we know who the model is now
  so long as your wife knows you posted it here itd be fine but there are plenty of dicks here probably 5 out of 12 people browsing /p/
  she knows she is who asked to have face blotted out
can you go into more detail on how you lit and processed these
  stop posting these you freak
  no post more pics of the naked girl laying in pasta
  more artistic rope bondage pls
    you do realize kinbaku/shibari originated in japan right
  that picture    cringe
    what was it
  some random asshole with a meme image of this is going in my degenerate white girls collection or something like that it was stupid and im thrilled that the janitorial staff took care of it
a literal boomer posting pictures of his naked wife on the 4chinz without even clearing exif data  old people should not be allowed to use the internet
  strip box about 30 above her and behind tilted down so just the edge of light grazed her    processing was pretty standard crushed the blacks a little dodge and burn on the hair or along the curves to taste a little skin healing wb and some split tone to taste    cropped to 169 because i liked it that way
  oh yeah go fuck yourself kid   my generation made the internet cool for you
  selftaught  no youre not this is an individualist delusion
  1 most people mean without a mentor or teacher when they say selftaught not that they did not utilize existing material   2 trial and error is absolutely selftaught in every sense of the word and is done all the time you fucking mong
  a teacher writing down their lessons does not eliminate the teacher the teacher is still teaching you stupid fuck  trialanderror still involves the tools teaching methods themselves you learn from the encoding of the concepts in the physical nature of the fucking object you goddamned mong
  reeeee i dont like artform since its related to sex  it has to be related to the kink implications and not the aesthetic  imagine being retarded
  i dont really care for rope bondage or anything bdsm really but i can appreciate the artistic merit of ops pics so yeah that anon is retarded
     a teacher writing down their lessons does not eliminate the teacher the teacher is still teaching you stupid fuck  did you even read point one the one about the meaning behind words or are you just being purposefully autistic     trialanderror still involves the tools teaching methods themselves you learn from the encoding of the concepts in the physical nature of the fucking object you goddamned mong   no fucking shit there is a minimum level of scientific knowledge needed to build a digital camera no way bro nobody could have ever known this until you pointed out im gonna let you know this is sarcasm because your autism obviously makes it hard for you to pick up on social cues  so no you arent taught something through the physical design of an object thats the broadest definition of teaching ive ever fucking heard and nobody uses it like that learn what people mean when they use words better yet go to whatever weird ass therapy they have for autistic people so they can interact with us normies without sperging out at normal usage of words
  tell me more senpai
  this is maybe the weirdest stupid semantic argument ive ever seen someone on /p/ choose as their hill to die on    like getting so mad that youre calling him a stupid fuck because why because the guy said he was self taught when he didnt in fact figure things out entirely from first principles by noticing how silver compounds he personally mined and mixed react to light what exactly the hell are you trying to accomplish what are you even doing with your life
   what exactly the hell are you trying to accomplish what are you even doing with your life   i see people do this all the time in lieu of going out and accomplishing something they sit around and nitpick actual accomplishment i blame academia sorry (((academia))) forgot where i was
welp it used to be 999 then it was 1499 and now it will be 1999    in late 2019 it will probably be raised to 2499    this is what happens when you pay for software as a service )))
  this might get me to drop it for capture one
  the fuck man
  lol
adobe ceo i want to raise prices again xdd how do we do it without raising suspicion    adobe marketing dude why dont we just do a sale with the current price and pretend like it always costed 20 bucks and when the sale ends the 20 bucks will be the current price xdd
  sure you arent switching your plan the 20gb plan is still 999
  lol op is retarded or a capture one shill
  paying for software when torrents exist
  op here it looks like adobe is defaulting to the 1tb plan for united states localized website version    my localized website verion of adobe in europe still defaults to 20gb probably because it hasnt been updated yet    any burgers here know if adobe always defaulted to the 1tb option or if they started doing it with this shady sale either way say goodbye to the 20gb option its probably being phased out kek
  yep fucking confirmed all north american countries are now defaulting to the 1tb option whereas all the other regions sweden israel united kingdom etc are defaulting to 20gb option    checking the wayback machine internet archive organization also says that the 20gb version for burger countries were the default
  yea if they do that i am going to c1 i dont want or need 1tb of data from them i dont even fucking need 20gbs i have a 3tb drive that was cheap as fuck and amazon includes unlimited storage of all image types in their prime membership
  torrenting software when free software exists
  software as service is a worrying trend
  implying this is even related to the topic or even an argument  go to the /shill/ thread buddy
  the market will eventually dictate who does what  only reason saas has gained so much ground is because the options arent mature enough to be an industry standard    once advertising agencies and designers start adopting other software suitess then and only then things will change
  c1 raised their prices for fuji  sony from like 5075 to 200 usd if you dont live there itll be like 250 in your currency       if you like adobe then pirate it its really that simple the hardest part of pirating it is finding a legit copy and even that step is easy
1tb of storage and a suite of software should be 999/month forever because im so special
  imagine having to pay every month for a product that gets updated every month    anon youre a fucking idiot
  missing out on security and bug fixes
  let me purchase the fucking thing outright when i was a teenager i couldnt afford photoshop but now im a successful young man and i dont want to have a bunch of monthly subscriptions that silently gets bumped in price every year
  i couldnt afford it when the adobe suite was 1200 but now its 240 a year i cant afford it    heres an idea pal dont be so riddled with poverty 
  when i was a teenager photoshop went for the high 3digits a 15 monthly subscription with automatic updates is fine by me
  the adobe suite is 60 per month thats 720 per year
  thats still half as much as it used to cost and there used to be new versions every year and i got my pricing wrong the stripped down cs suite was 1300 pre cc the full suite was 2400    so yep the new version is barely a third of the price each year than the pre sub model lets look at it from adobes perspective can they double their prices and lose less than half their members if thr answer is yes of coursr they are gonna more profit more turnover less customers perfect
  when did they raise it last month i got charged 999 same as always
  very true    i will argue though that they probably have to spend less time perfecting the product because now they can send out endless patches rather than getting it right the first time and they also have extremely minimal distribution costs
  this has been the tactic for cheap trash forever steam is a good example where every now and then a shitty vendor will do exactly this its illegal in europe so they tend to be crappy products who dont give a shit but every now and then triple a companies try the same thing because 1 10 price difference might mean several million in sales and 2 their customers tend to be dumb enough to fall for it      its been around for a long time its just that most of todays internet and software users are too young to remember when 999 of software was free operating systems included  however in parallel free and open software is also thriving and the quality of free software for photography is continually increasing and competing with the often lesser paid stuff    its a common misnomer or interpretation to see subscription services as the ultimate doom of software because ultimately free software is always going to be able to compete and always has and more so as the internet collective grows and demand increases    tldr stop worrying and stop paying for it if its really a problem for you      if you like adobe then pirate it its really that simple the hardest part of pirating it is finding a legit copy and even that step is easy  there arent any modern torrents of lightroom so essentially my camera raws wont work unless i pay for lightroom thats the whole reason they went subscription based in the first place longterm greed      darktable gets updated every month too this is a ridiculous statement      i prefer to pay a subscription fee for the foreseeable future which will become more expensive than an already overpriced flat fee would be after 28 years  youve got it backwards because this is the mentality of a poor person not to mention most people are going to be photographers on and off for the rest of their lives
  minimal distribution costs  lmao no bandwidth isnt cheap when all your clients are using cloud services for huge files    i got my first copy of photoshop off floppy disks on the front of a magazine the 30 day trial could still be reset by fudging the system clock even back then to get the full unlocked version you rang up and they read out a key to youthis was cheap distribution getting someone else to pay for the media  getting a copy in every home      overpriced flat fee    its only overpriced if you dont get that much value back from it 240 a year for all the software i need to bring in my income is a drop in the ocean my car payments are more than that per week and id much rather pay that then the thousands i would have had to pay before but still it was a bargain for professionals    have you ever tried purchasing solidworks they dont have prices on their website they have a form to fill out for an appointment so a salesman can come out to you and i still consider the price i pay for their services to be more than reasonable for the returns i make from it
  its only overpriced if you dont get that much value back from it 240 a year for all the software i need to bring in my income is a drop in the ocean  granted but so is an iphone or any other product when youre subjective about the price  when you look at it purely objectively then practically any cost is too high for adobe software in general in 2018 the reason theyre capable of charging this much is because theyve been an industry standard for so long and the obvious problems of subscriptions are also a major turn off for many people so personal choice and morals become a part of the equation too    ultimately paying for lightroom and adobe products is for most down to price vs return and for you thats a reasonable sacrifice for the majority of people it isnt and better options exist for others still subscriptions are impossible for others still subscriptions are immoral and im sure there are even neckbeards who would never pay for software despite being able to nobody is wrong im just not willing to see people justify their subscription by saying its cheap      i got my first copy of photoshop off floppy disks on the front of a magazine the 30 day trial could still be reset by fudging the system clock even back then  afaik you can do the same with the trials today meaning you can download and install lr/ps every month without paying  i remember those phonecallactivations though and 9 times out of 10 you could get away with saying your keycode was scratched and theyd give you a new one rather than tell you to return it for another copy  early piracy was a lot cooler than it is today
  but iphone isnt expensive relatively    it is because theres countless products that do the same job for less    c1 and dxo are no more affordable and arguably less complete products    but gimp is free    gimp is like saying why use iphone when theres a perfectly good rotary phone in the hallway
  wouldnt know never used gimp i had darktable in mind which is essentially lightroom with more tools and less lens correction profiles in 2018  open software also tends to last way longer than commercial software which is a compounding factor when lightroom subscription goes into the thousands after a few years
  from a professional standpoint darktable doesnt come close to adobe    lens profiles camera profiles easy colour correction profiles decent cataloging integration with a raster editor works on windows can work remotely tethering etc etc    im sure its fine for fucking with sliders as hobbyists are want to do
  he doesnt like rotary phones    enjoy your botnet faggot
  when i was a young man adobe made software that helped you explore your creativity these days they charge you so that they can snoop around in your system happily packaging up your private data ready to sell to anyone who asks
  all phones are botnet anon even the dumbest of the dumbphones just for being on they constantly connect to the nearest cell and lets them know your position
  i actually find darktable faster for commercial workflow the only exception beings directly opening in and coordinating with photoshop and the slowass/limited keyword functionality  if youre a professional though you should have no concerns paying for lightroom anyway
  rotary phone  look it up and youll notice how dumb you sound
  just use cracked version like a normal person

  pay once cry once not this drip feeding money shit
  security fixes on a raw processor/image editor  you just proved not knowing shit about software or computer security congrats anon    allow me to explain in order for an attacker to exploit a bug in a piece of software they require a way to interact with that piece of software an isolated computer program whichs only form of input comes from the user and the camera raws isnt going to magically become vulnerable to remote attacks    operating systems web browsers software running with privileged system permissions those are vulnerable to attacks since their input comes from untrusted parties like websites network and unprivileged system users an image editor on the other hand only takes the input the user gives it    the only way an image editor could possibly be exploited by an attacker is if the user often opens files from untrusted sources on it then a specially crafted image/raw files could exploit said software bug but in order for that to work the attacker would have to know what software their target was running what version and would have to social engineer the user to open said file with said program that of course would be very unlikely to happen unless you work on a studio and receive files from clients daily if thats the case just pay the adobe tax youre making fair money from it anyway but if youre editing your photos like most people then dont worry your camera isnt going to write malicious files to your sd card

  its been around for a long time its just that most of todays internet and software users are too young to remember when 999 of software was free operating systems included    the hell are you talking about are you talking about piles of basic trash in the 60s and 70s operating systems sure as hell werent free then and if you wanted professional software you had to hire a programmer and get it custom made

not using on1         shits dope     i dropped adobe awhile back for their jew practices i use this as a lightroom replacement and affinity photo as a photoshop replacement
just a few years ago in 2015 lightroom 6 was 140 i think ive seen it on sale for 99 but i just checked my receipts and thats what i paid in december of 2015 thats the version i am still running and it works with all my current cameras if i had instead bought lightroom as the 10/mo subscription over the same 3 year period of ownership i would have paid 360 which is almost three times more money spent renting the software instead of owning an individual license someone buying lightroom today will find that they cannot outright buy a current version of the software

  its not when you have to subscribe for everything nowadays    thats the problem of the subscription service  the fact youre a whiny bitch and by your logic if you subscribed to light room first youd be fine with it    pirate if you want cunt i bet youre one of those retards who tries to justify it like buying shit is so hard so you have to pirate it     was some reddit thread on wanting to watch the wire and how hard it was in australia    meanwhile our cable company here has it with a streaming service and no box its on itunes and google play shows and the dvd box set is available on amazon and retail outlets and he cries how bad the market it so he hes forced to pirate

  this would be ok if it wasnt like 11
dof meme aside as long as you have a story behind your photos youre already doing better than 80 of the snapshitters here  good job anon
  i dont think its 11 aside like the whole 169 thing with added grain and grading
okay that just sounds like its a 11 but i meant to say like im still out and taking photos framed differently etc
              not really a fan of heavy handed processing/crop but i do enjoy these images

  aside the blue tint exp 1 or something i dont know and cbf rummaging through my hdd im pretty sure the exif is still on there so stalk that if youd like
what mode do you actually shoot in most of the time      manual is cool and all but when you have seconds to get the shot you need its too much effort to keep on track
m and a mode
m because i never shoot stuff that i need to be super quick with
  p for quickshooting  m for slowshooting
  manual when i have time no flash when dont have time and sports for flying birds    i have no idea what p mode is for and what it does i tried to read the user manual on that but didnt understood i guess its not a feature im really missing or else i would get into it
my camera has no modes or lightmeter for that matter  i think the woman face mode looks the best
  m and p mostly m
    i shoot in nikon fm2 mode
pretty much always a i just pick an aperture and adjust iso as i go to keep my shutter speeds to where i can realistically handhold them maybe do a couple of clicks down on the exposure compensation dial i dont really feel the need to shoot m much im just as happy to let the camera do the work for me based on my selected aperture/iso
a and m
i cant afford digital so i use aperture priority 90 of the time
  aperture priority iso auto 1003200 range sometimes shutter priority  might look into p and tav modes though
  m  auto iso is my snapshot mode    aperture is set for the desired depth of field shutter speed is set to stop the motion either of the camera or the subject if the iso will rise to astronomical figures i open up the aperture and if that doesnt help i slow down the shutter speed and even if that isnt enough get a tripod and fuck auto iso
    only correct answers itt
honestly after m its just a  i do shoot p but its only what i put the camera in when shut off or walking around in case i need a quick shot but ive never experienced a super decisive moment just like that at best what a supercar or a lulzsorandom hipster but never a shooting suicide or something newspaper worthy
mas on cam with at least two control dials so its ether apperutre and exposure on separate dials or aperture and shutter for m pm on pointandshoot and and one dial control cams
aperture priority with auto iso most of the time probably like 9095     m if im using off camera flash or in a super tricky lighting situation where av gets confused eg fire performers     shutter priority if i want a long exposure of something waterfalls dancers where i want to catch more movement etc
olympus aperture priority m when dicking around with a tripod and something stationary obviously m for live composite which is kinda fun
  aperture priority with auto iso  i find that my camera doesnt trust me enough to take a steady shot whenever i do this lol always gives me like a full stop of iso that couldve just been a slower shutter speed that still wouldve turned out fine
  if you have one of the better nikons you can adjust the shutter speed preference fast  slow
  nope canon m5 you may begin to laugh at me now
  you may begin to laugh  why its basically a flagship of the m series
    p is program auto the program essentially picks the lowest shutter speed at which you can shoot handheld depending on the lens you have mounted and the aperture that will give you the largest depth of field it does this according to a program line which is a hell of a lot simpler than you might expect    you can also shift the program line if you dont like the shutter speed/aperture combo it picked while maintaining the same exposure its the best of both aperture and shutter priority modes though beginner and intermediate photographers avoid it because they think its less pro and gives them less control over the image this is due purely to ego and inexperience
  true and i like it just fine just seems that the consensus of the community on the m series is that its kind of a dead end and there have been a couple of videos from jared polin and kai/lok/digitalrev where theyve made a joke about how nobody actually shoots with the m series
  i see now it balances the aperture according to the shutter speed i select thanks got it now  though my camera seems to not do auto iso in p mode unless i enable auto iso globally in the menu which takes more time than turning a knob so noflash mode is still better when i need to snap sometime really fast since it uses auto iso even if global iso is set to manual as i always keep it
  something
  pas
i only shot in professional mode    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific properties
m  a sometimes p if speed is of essence  on my xpro its a with autoiso because i use it as snapshit camera
  p should be avoided on ibis cams and lenses with good stabilization since it gives you wrong shutter speeds
manual for almost everything  ap for events/gigs/action/most paid stuff  auto iso with a maximum and minimum even in manual  back button focus    havent had current camera long enough to set and use p but ill likely be using it for night and event stuff soon despite body having ibis    outside of paid/studio i rarely have to change anything other than aperture and shutter speed and i do both on the fly while moving between locations/scenes
  there have been a couple of videos from jared polin and kai/lok/digitalrev  imagine actually giving fk about any of these  use the camera and have fun
  use the camera and have fun  i do though lol i said in the same post that i like it just fine it was just a bit of self deprecating humour not me legitimately disliking my camera because some youtubers dont like it
  aperture  programs fine for photos of people i guess but most stuff i care about depth of field
i almost always shoot manual i sometimes shoot ap during events i cant remember a situation where i use sp but im sure i have
got too used to manual so its all i can now use easily its instinctive and trying other modes just trips me up and annoys me takes a fraction of a second to decide on the best settings and im never haphazardly pointing my camera anywhere to need a faster computer decision studio work is all manual and im swapping between a digital and my 67 there which is fully manual anyway
aperture priority
  yeah this      mind you ive lately made use of the memory recall mode its essentially p but with several presets you customise yourself a pain to set up amd calibrate every single setting but i fond myself more often using it than anything else now since i like to take day and night shots    if i need to change one setting the preset works as a great basedefaukt to deviate from
  but p mode is the pro mode
  aperture and manual
  friendly reminder auto will work better than what you think you can do manually 99 of the time
ass mode
  s/tv because my hands are shaky as fuck
  i shoot 80 of the time in aperture priority during mostly daytime shots and if the shutter speed is too slow on hand i try to compensate with a jump in iso but depend on the situations during lowlight i avoid going lower than f4 and iso higher than 800 because my previous camera d5100 starts to lose details past iso 1000 so if no other option is available i always carry my trusty tripod to add slower shutter speeds
  on holiday right now in japan have seen more canon m mirrorless cameras than almost any other mirrorless they seem like great cameras but gearfags hate canon youtube shills opinions are worth dirt
  gearfags hate canon  why
  but gearfags hate canon  videofags hate canon  ftfy
i use aperture because it sounds fancy
  aperture value with manual iso the patricians choice adjust exposure compensation rather than shutter speed gives you a lot of control without having to fiddle with ss
i use manual a lot because its easier than figuring out how to lock exposure
  exclusively m  full control of the camera is essential to call yourself photographer
i use auto and yet my photos are better than pics of 99 of /p/s ishootonlymmodebecauseiamseriousphotographer    implying thats not true
  this you guys are trying to be a bunch of superstars with your manual modes  aperture priority with auto 2001600 iso 9999 of the time   if i dont like the shutter speed or it gives me i use the exposure compensation dial like a normal person    you point the camera expose the scene how you want then hit the ael button    your photos are what determine your worth as a photographer not your shooting process although i can see how patting yourself on the back for shooting manual can make you feel better if your photos are shit
  80 a  20 m
  since my photos are so shitty i have to find other ways to make myself feel superior that dont involve the hard work of actually developing artistic talent
av for portraits tv for moving subjects m for anything involving flash
  your photos are what determine your worth as a photographer not your shooting process    whatever helps you sleep at night
  everyone is shitty at first but at some time ill have to take it a step further i cant let all the time my camera to decide how to compose my photos thats how you grow as a photographer find out why your photos suck take them again the right way
aperture priority 95 of the time unless im doing astro proper depth of field is the most important aspect of an image to me and i very rarely shoot moving subjects
  i dont understand greentext so im responding as if that person was actually saying it himself rather than sarcastically mocking the anon hes replying to  also im confused about the difference between exposure and composition apparently
  you missunderstood my responsei could explain it morebut id rather sleep happy haunting fellow camera user
if you shoot auto how is there any skill involved how is it any different than the average basic white bitch instagram star using point and shoot
manual but auto iso and white balance better to end up with a grainy photo that doesnt suffer from motion blur or bad focus
av or tv i only use m for panoramas going for manual in most scenarios is just pointless
  going for manual in most scenarios is just pointless    that was painful to read
auto for portraits and ladscapes p for quick snapshits
  thats the joke
  if you shoot auto how is there any skill involved   composition subject choice timing judging light knowing where to go for a good photo knowing how to get your subject looking its best picking your focal length telling a story visually so very very many skills are involved in getting a good photo besides matching a needle in your viewfinder     if you think the only thing that separates you from a bad photographer is something that can be completely automated by a 70sera computer and automated more quickly and effectively than youre doing it what exactly the hell do you think youre adding to the process    youre like someone saying that a person who writes with a typewriter has no skill compared to someone who hand draws letters but cant string together a sentence
  m for panoramas  what kind of brick do you shoot on that you need to use manual for ponorama
  presumably he means stitched panoramas so taking multiple shots of one scene to build a bigger image you dont want the automatic exposure or autofocus changing the settings between shots
manual on nikon because it allows me to control shutter speed and aperture iso is autoiso this is for situations which do not allow flash    with flash and portraits i just fucking spray and pray ttl with the highest shutter speed and widest aperture
i use the automatic setting on my smartphone
  thats actually fair but when i do auto i cant even focus on the subject i want the way that i want
people actually use auto over p    explains so much about this board
    got a source on that
p and a sometimes m
  when i do auto i cant even focus on the subject i want the way that i want  i was assuming that most of the people talking about auto actually meant p or one of the priority modes on cameras where things other than full auto are an option ie modes where the exposure is totally or partially automatic but you can override it and override things like your focus point etc
  so what do you say for focus then
  i use autofocus but generally in the mode where i get to pick where it automatically focuses only time i go fullauto on the focus is when im shooting from the hip
  m the only thing i change apart from iso ss and aperture is shutter/aperture priority when needed
  not sure how those modes work even considering myself especially amateurish i always exclusively shoot in m
m only sometimes p when i have to be fast
manual for video aperture priority for photo
  whats a mode
approximately 70 a 29 s 1m    when i spend xxxx on a hitech stateoftheart camera i expect it to do some of the heavy lifting so i can concentrate on the framing the image
  i keep it in manual and just miss the shot
  i think he meant to say rode like which microphone do people here shoot their videos with
am i retard for almost always using s
  manual unless im shooting with a vintage lens then i have to use av because in full manual the live view is underexposed by two stops because it thinks the lens is an f/0
am i the only asshole that shoots s i do lots of street and honestly having a shallower depth of field isnt nearly as important as making sure a subject isnt a blurry mess if theyre moving quick
strangely i only use a and s these days
  i only shoot shutter priority and with auto iso because my lens is adapted and its not recognised by the camera
this thread was a real eyeopeneri  cant believe this is the type of people that mostly visit /p/ bragging about using auto and that m is too much trouble thats what being a photographer meanstaking the decisions yourself otherwise you are no defferent than basic bitches on instagrami could reply to each one indevidualy but fuck its too many of you unfotunatelyi  get using modes at first but claiming that they make you a pro and expensive cameras should do the heavy lifting is bullshit   i use to tell my self to sleep at nighthave  fun photographers this board is a fucking joke
  ur fucking dumb
outside of a studio setting im in a 99 of the time
    mostly a occasionally m in super low light conditions
  i decide to set my cameras exposure to what my cameras exposure meter tells me to set it at not my camera thats what makes me a better photographer than you
  this  auto will always set the f stop too high and slow down the shutter resulting in blurry pics for most people
  taking the decisions  agonising over which way to turn a couple of knobs doesnt make you a photographer either even in manual you should be able to analyse your scene and set your camera pretty damned quick unfortunately subjects invariably move a lot quicker a good photographer is one who gets the shot not one who is still wanking his dials about five minutes after the shot has gone
  shutter priority for me when shooting birds
  exposure is the least important part of a good photograph the less thought about it the better the camera is better than you at determining a proper exposure get over it

yup i used whatever the default company is when you make a photo book in lightroom is it was decent
  gluedots
  just googled it since i couldnt remember it looks like they use blurb    
  have a colorimeter in the mail cant wait to finally get prints hated to not be able to properly edit my photos
uk here i use bobbookspricey but decent quality
i made one with freeprints the editor app is fairly strong and allows you to make something classy if you really hammer at it id like more options for the paper stock than standard and glossy as i really like a nice heavy matte paper     ill probably just learn indesign and shop around next time now that i know what i like
blurb is good but i found that i needed to make my images very dark in lightroom if i wanted them to print correctly blurb prints pretty light
has anyone used blurb in australia wondering how long they would usually take
i use saal or freeprint   saal is really professional while freeprint gives you nice results at a lower price   also its almost free
fuji film simulation thoughts i usually shoot i the standard provia but lately ive been playing around with the punchy velvia and i really like it    does anyone use these filters thoughts easier than doing the work post
  theyre fucking garbage and equivalent of eating a ready meal and trying to fool yourself its as good as a scratch made meal
    yes i often use the film sim bracketing for pics i know i wont do anything with but post online     i like them     its not a replacement for post but sometimes its more fun to just take pictures
hey guys got my first dslr and want my pictures criticized
    resize your shit
compositions not bad but you need to work on the exposure
youd be better off not posting anything here for a while you just started and most of your photos are going to be shit its a hard truth but once you realize that you can grow as a photographer and get gud
  was this worth its own thread
  got any experience in the field of photography so far or is this your first camera ever
please give me my instant gen z gratification    faggot just stay offline and shoot for a couple of years
  if you are going to shoot trough a window be mindful of dirt and reflections  also resize your shit
the first one is actually pretty decent but you need a more specific subject the second one is a bit crooked and not very interesting  start getting into post processing first to remove spots like you have in the sky of the second picture or just really anything that isnt aesthetic like maybe you have garbage in the background of a pic or whatever  and also to play with colours and get your own editing style or whatever its gonna take quite a while for that though if it will even happen  another thing i can think of telling you is in the first picture for example you couldve exposed in a way to get the sky to not be blown out and then you could lift the shadows in the foreground because basically its easier to get detail out of a dark image compared to a blown highlight
theyre nothing shots of nothing    judt like any creative tool you need to practice imagine saying i just got my first guitar heres a clip of me playing it and how absolutely terrible that song would sound    thats your photos right now if you knew anything at all aboit photography you would have never posted these or taken them
  tbh 999 of photos are shots of nothing
  shots of nothing are fine  nothing shots of nothing are not fine
  on 4chan facebook and photography forums yes
your shots are and will be garbage for at least the first 10000 shots this is normal    without seeing more we cant give you anything useful but youve posted two snapshots so i suspect youre simply stopping and taking shots whenever you see something remotely interesting looking      for example is a snapshot because theres a reflection and a sunset but youve ignored both and simply taken a snapshot if you want the reflection then make it the subject with perhaps the tree as reference if you want the sunset then find a nice foreground and shoot the sunset hell get low and close and shoot the puddle with the sun setting in it and you have an interesting subject      similarly youve seen a nice horizon line and snapped it instead of composing or isolating a subject its also underexposed and you have a dirty lens but technical issues arent your main drawback yet    read some beginner mistakes meme articles on google because youre currently doing all of them again normal the most apparent is 1 business and not picking a subject and 2 snapshotting instead of composing    keep sucking til you dont rock on
  yet youre here
nobody noticed the dust on the sensor    op youre too much of a newfag to clean your own sensor but know that it needs to be done
  thats a ufo moron
  i suppose your composition cant be off if you dont have a subject      not the most interesting scene as someone else said pick a point of interest and make that the shot this is the same sunset i see daily through my kitchen window get low get high get close to something shoot through some leaves if the scene isnt great show it from another perspective to keep it interesting      18 million pixels and 15 million are a sky without any points of interest if you like the gradient in the sky zoom in on it or crop it or aim down   if you like the trees against the sky make them the subject youve got 18mp and   maybe one of them is interesting  get closer stop shooting sunsets without interesting foregrounds and post in /rpt/
          i dont even know anything about photography but the first one looks great to me    
  the first 10000  lol that seems like a bit of an exaggeration unless youre a really slow learner or youre talking about just the first 10000 pictures in genera and not the first 10000 shots you keep
  i dont know anything so i will give my completely uninformed opinion    
  it only looks great to you because its shaper than the budget cell phone cameras youre used to
  dude the composition was trash      i suppose your composition cant be off if you dont have a subject  what
  whats the subject
  thats a bit outdated on film your first 10k shots are practice on digital its your first 100k    once youre a regular shooter its not difficult to rattle off 100k shots every year    and be honeat witb yourself considering you have just picked up this hobby how long do you think it should be before you creep over competence how long would it take you to learn a musical instrument for the first time up to a competent level 4 maybe 5 years with daily practice camera is no different in fact using a camera to produce pleasing results is probably a lot lot harder everyone has a camera and being technically proficient with todays technology should take no longer than a weekend being technically proficient with an instrument is enough to get by as you are expected to copy others creativity you dont get that break in photography you cant just copy other photos and there is so much competition from teenagers with smartphones and all the time in the world you have to be both technically and creatively practiced to not produce utter trash
  im not convinced its useful to talk about numbers of shots these days its easy to run around all day spraying and praying these days without getting any better
      totally agree with this guy using reflections as your subject is an easy way to get good photos simply because its not just a picture it automatically gives it a subject and uses focus that everyone can see
  so youre saying this is a lazy way of doing things
very boring /10
  the best thing about you attempting and taking pics is that your mind sees the picture you are trying to take when you take a pic you wont notice it differ as much until you get criticism but eventually like the posters saying the 10k barrier you will be able to better pull your vision of the shot out and execute it with your shooting skills    just dont let it get to your head and get all fuckin defensive when someone offers advice scathing as they may be
  tbf theres also a lot of bullshit advice on /p/
    they look like you just got your first dslr     keep trying     and thats serious advice not me just flaming youkeep working at it youre not great but youll get better if you keep working at it but also yeah dont shoot through a window with crap on it
nice work keep it up

  didnt mean to sage some faggot on /g/ was making lewd requests something along these lines op your original photo was of a sunset but there was too much going on that was distracting i think i tightened it up and brought out some of that orange i think you were going for
  nice edit
  to be fair photography is infinitely more forgiving than music
  first find more interesting things to take photo of
  shoot in raw not in jpeg  learn to post process and download/subscribe lightroomphotoshop  also read understanding exposure by bryan peterson to have some basic knowledge on exposure

  what inspired you to much such a pointless comment
  what inspired you to write much instead of make
  this is certainly good advice for taking a certain path buy many people are happy to be casual photographers
  whos getting all fuckin defensive bro
  dude imagine i just got my first guitar and i asked everyone to listen to a song i made after the first day with it    there is 0 chance it sounds nice or theres any advice to give except to hit the books and practice for a thousand or so hours     photography is just the same people are misled by how easy it is to take a technically proficient image a technically proficient image is the equivalent of hitting the demo button on a casio keyboard sounds neat but is completely void of value    come back in 6 months if you manage to shoot and edit every day come back in 2 years if its every weekend dont come back at all if its any less
      two photos deserve their own thread nope besides that these photos are pretty boring
  there are far more selftrained photographers than selftrained musicians you cant play a technically competent piece first time you pick up a guitar but thats totally possible with photography
  two photos deserve their own thread  yes they do     the rpt is the only other option and its exceedingly rare for someone to get any sort of critique there
    garbage as expected now fuck off and shoot for a couple of years before coming back
  shave a few months off for him and give actual feedback next time
  advice on /p/ where
  except it isnt because everyone has a camera and theres no hurdle to learn anything technical to stand out from a rank amateur you need to express a good creative vision you cant just hide behind 80s hair metal fret wankery someone else invented 30 years ago
  there were 11 million ilcs sold in 2016    there were 20 million guitars sold in 2016    id expect people to update their cameras more often than their instruments a guitar has barely settled after 3 years whereas a camera is outdated clearly there are many more at least wannabe musicians than photographers
  at least wannabe  thats the key part  we both know there are a lot of guitars out there gathering dust in a corner
  as someone who taught himself both guitar and photography i have to say photography was much easier to learn and get good at
  how sure are you that you ever got good at photography
  lots of cameras too though
muh critique  general point not aimed at anyone in particular  ive never understood this meme post stuff you genuinely think is excellent and stop wasting peoples brain cells with half arsed crap that you already know isnt up to scratch  expecting some army of altruistic wise men to descend on your snapshit in the rpt is absurd
  beautiful
  a camera is outdated after three years  fucks sake why did nobody tell me mine is 45 years old
holy fuck  how did this thread survive three months
  sorry man im afraid your camera is now 42 years out of date time to gear up
  i do see your point however i cant agree for two reasons     first of all what you propose seems needlessly wasteful of time you seem to be saying that people dont deserve an opinion on their photos until they believe their work to be almost perfect critique is valuable as it often takes an unbiased eye to see where a style is going wrong so theres no harm in giving and getting some pointers while still developing a photographic aesthetic     and perhaps more significantly /p/ is supposed to be for peoples photos the boards special rule is that you can only post pictures that you took  which op here has obeyed and gear threads always break if you want to talk about technology head on over to /g/ this is a photography board for peoples photos and its not fair to criticise users for making posts in line with the spirit of /p/
  this one is legit fantastic no way its a beginner photo
  usually when i stumble upon such pieces of work i set the picture on full screen and prepare myself some coffee sometimes even an expensive bottle of red wine and stare at the art whilst drinking my beverage it really takes a giant idiot to think that these delicacies are appreciated by a quick image hover on 4chan when in reality one has to study it as if it were in a museum who would appreciate starry night if it was on your 200 phones screen because lets be honest if youre a regular in this board youre most likely poor or on your 1080p blackfridaydeal laptop distance yourself from your own mental limitations and do something right for once    anyways when i finished my drink i had to take a moment for myself if you know what i mean this picture has led me to believe that i must obtain whatever gear you used in order to take my craft one step closer to your masterpiece what a magnificent photography you have created here anon i cannot believe that your work hasnt been published in magazines or presented in art galleries all around the world truly a thing to behold and it boggles my mind that youre not a tripfag or else i would follow your work closely even the title of this work is just i i have no words to describe what i felt    please keep us updated this board needs more professional photographers like you if only half of the idiots that browse this board would have an ounce of your creative mind this wouldnt be such a barbaric gearfagging board as it is in its current state    thanks for making my day anon and i wish to see more of your art often you should sign your photographs
    he doesnt know about technical stuff so his opinion is worthless  man i didnt know you guys were such elitist faggots the only measure of a good photo is if people like looking at it get over yourselves
    didnt even see this post yikes

  i like that youre consistent and serious about your work  so herere few suggestions for you anon     please take more portraits of interesting looking people who attend these concerts  i know its hard and everyone have anxiety while meeting new people or taking peoples photos in general but you should overcome that if you wanna grow more and this is the hard part   try to look things from a photographer perspective/philosophy were there to document the scene so photographing bands only is half part or may be little part of the scene people/audience make the scene they are the big part you have to photograph them go meet with the people in your area who live that punk life often they have interesting stuff and stories or theres something cool about their personalities  am i sure your photography will stand out by doing     check out   larry clarks tulsa  nan goldins the ballad of sexual dependency  these both photogs documented their local scene and their life in that time period study how they documented their work what are some interesting elements from which their work stands out etc  just study their work learn from it and then make your own way of doing things    here a link to /p/ee photobook dump it has larry clarks tulsa in it but its incomplete it think   
    thanks for your suggestion completely agree with the point about taking photos of other things in the scene need to work on being less of an awkward fuck

  people dont pay to go to concerts with the intent of being photographed by /p/weirdos this is clearly the wrong place for this but i dont think photographing a live act is always appropriate unless you are on the venues payroll    really like ops images though so keep it up i guess
  people dont pay to go to concerts with the intent of being photographed by /p/weirdos  literally everyone in ops pics is a weirdo who i doubt doesnt give enough of a shit to care if some random faggot takes their photo i go to gigs like this all the time and the togs are always snapping photos of the bands and crowd and what not not once have i noticed anyone complaining can tell youve never been to anything like this nor will you ever keep your sjw squander to yourself next time
  people dont pay to go to concerts with the intent of being photographed by /p/weirdos  this is clearly the wrong place for this  youre a fucking massive snowflake faggot   all these are hardcore/anarcho punks who dont give a shit about any nerd from a anime forum taking their photos and even in indie concerts people dont give a shit   who doesnt like attention     i alway take candids of people on concerts and some people ask for my ig so they can hmu for their photos later   you have to go back
    op here thats how i grow most of my follower on ig actually bands and audience asking to see pics of the event after    its okay that some people dont understand how these shows work since its sorta underground but he/she couldve used language that is less strong
op i follow you on insta and youre probably one of my favorite accounts keep it up

  overexposed and needs a tripod  i mean even if you dont have a tripod it seems you could have placed the camera somewhere in that roof and used a slow shutter speed and low iso to remove that awful noise    also cameras lightmeter tends to overexpose at night so i always underexpose one or two stops at night    as for the composition it could be improved a lot it seems there isnt really a clear subject but i wouldnt call it a landscape either its kinda messy desu  also if it wasnt for the yellow licence plate i would swear it was portugal or spain im curious now what country is that shot from
  thanks for the feedback senpai  its nicosia
  interesting i never heard of it just checked on wikipedia that street and the green trashbin looks exactly like the ones we have here    also dont be afraid to check your histograms after each shot you may suspect to be over or underexposed
cherokee st saint louis
this is an interesting little strip the neighborhood was originally the main center of mexican immigrants in st louis along with a lot of poor black residents but a wave of white hipsters has been crashing into it leaving it a weird cultural mix also leaving it with graffiti basically everywhere
lots of authentic mexican restaurants lots of hipster bars lots of weird little combinations of architecture which lead to stuff like this partial alleyway blocked off by a fedex mailbox and of course graffiti
im going to go ahead and peg your age at around 2023     keep posting
so the street is kind of divided into three zones  1 the mexican blocks lots of authentic mexican restaurants little bodegas etc this little mexican store had a display of ceramic frogs in the window that looked like they were the victims of a poison gas attack  2 the hipster parts which include a lot of quirky restaurants and bars resale shops and venues including weirdly an extremely inauthentic mexican restaurant or two run by white people  3 the antique district on the other side of the street from the big cherokee statue this is where the affluent nonhipster white people go to buy old shit for their houses
halloween/day of the dead decorations which was weird cause i shot these earlier tonight and its november 24th
  curious as to why you think that    this girl saw me taking pictures and posed for the camera not the best image quality because she was kind of far away and i was shooting with a 28mm so i had to crop a bunch
this shop was about midway between the hipster and mexican sections of the street and caters to both
cherokee as a neighborhood is big on the st louis pride so you get a lot of little fleur de lis flourishes on fences and stuff theres a shop that sells things like saint fuckin louis tshirts theres a wall that has a tile mosaic of the st louis city flag etc
how i assume most of you will react if i say i have more photos i can post
  you said it pretty well yourself
  post more dont be a faggot and delete your exif
  interesting my familys from st louis but i never knew about this indian statue cool
  post more   check  dont be a faggot   ehhh  and delete your exif  check    2 out of 3 aint bad

  yeah i do but two fucking stops lmao outdoors im off max half a stop and indoors 1 stop
what asa do i need for 800mm in daylight without a tripod i mean not proper 800 but 200mm with 2 teleconverters is it possible at all
  im still learning to read indoor and less common light levels especially in fading light where its more difficult to notice changes     i would guess 400 speed would be fine depending on the aperture youre using
  aperture will be as open as my lens can go i dont really care about image quality that much are you sure 400 is ok i use 200 and handheld 400mm is not possible without a tripod

  i was shooting 300mm at 50iso recently with no troubles though it was with an f4 lens maybe you should just push to 800 or 1600 like a madman to be safe
  being off 2 stops outside is literally impossible if you even attempt to use sunny 16 literature
  well thats strange with my 400mm i could either choose 1/500s and get underexposure or get a shaky picture i guess the teleconverter is making a large impact the lens is only 200mm
  i go for periods guessing when im out shooting for the day im usually pretty well on when i do stop to check
  its alright
  youre right i forgot tc usually consumes as much light as the crop factor shouldnt you just use a film 12 stops faster than the one you used then
what kind of glass is recommended to sandwich the film when scanning it  ive scanned with a dslr many times before but always very badly with mediocre or terrible results  i want to have the film as flat as possible and use a lightpad so i can do 11 scanning and then stitch together instead of frame covering about the digital one  current results with film on a carton tube  geypeg to snapseed to geypeg because i havent pirated cs in this laptop
i guess i could ask this question in /fgt/ or /gear/    is 400 a good deal for all this  toyo 4x5 omega view  1x 210mm  2x 100mm  5x film holders  focus hood  6x7 film back  polaroid back useless as film in gone  bag bellow  tripod  case for everything    the camera itself is in good condition and the tripod works but might be going ive been thinking about getting into landscape and portraits with something large and methodical
  thats a really good deal anon all of that goes for around 1k ish
  antinewton glass the kind you use in enlargers
  right thanks i knew it had the name of a physicist
  any glass is going to limit your potential resolution fluid mounting is the only option for highest possible results while keeping your film flat  anti newton glass is fine for small enlargements
  my expectation is to have a simple and fast workflow the setups i have used so far require retuning for each frame which makes it a slow process i was hoping with the glass to just keep everything level and slide it around while keeping the camera as is and take the pictures from the pc
  when i use to dslr scan i made this its especially a box with a hole in the bottom to put your smart phone for backlighting with a slide mount on top i modified so you can feed a strip of film through it gave up on dslr scanning as its so much of a hassle bought a plustek and never looked back
  good deal if most of it is in good condition id go for it sell polaroid back and one 100mm on ebay or whatever
  i borrowed some scanners from my grandpa but they either crop the frame a bit or are not that quicker than a fast workflow
  acceptable but why two 100mm lenses 5 holders is ok to start with    not a bad starting kit i started with something similar in 4x5 210 is a great focal length but 100 i cant think of too many good lenses in that category
okay anons after i sell some old gear and other stuff i should come up with around 2k in the market for a 6x7 camera still too poor for the mamiya 7 looking at the gw670 but i really want a built in meter
  im assuming they are two different 100mms with different fstops the ad doesnt say
  save up an extra few hundred and you could get a memeiya 7 built in lightmeters are an absolute meme and a half handhelds are way more accurate and youd want accuracy since you get less shots on mf recently bought a sekonic l308s and its single handedly my best photography related purchase   or you could get the gw670 sekonic l308s and 600 worth of film or 600 on traveling the fuji gw cameras are super underrated i own the gw690ii but it unfortunately needs to be sent out for repair id go for the mark ii 670 over the mark iii for a few different reasons the mark ii has a slightly brighter viewfinder is slightly lighter and is way cheaper  another option if you really want a mf rf with a lightmeter is the gs645 yeah its 645 but for around 500 you cant beat it
  if you want best bang for your back get a fuji gsw690 and a gw690 for 10001200 and throw on top one of the shoe mount meters for 150    thus you have a wide and a normal lens both very sharp and contrasty in other rf systems like a mamiya 7 just a single lens would cost that much    plus big 6x9 negatives that you can crop to 6x7 if you feel like it  the gw670 im not sure if its worth it its the same size as the 690 same exact lens it just has a 6x7 mask at the film gate  another underrated system is the older gl690 imagine a gw690 with interchangeable lenses they even have a superwide 50mm expensivem but not mamiya expensive the normal lens though was improved in the gw690 version better formula and coatings    what are you shooting anyway cause if youre doing portraits with long lenses you shouldnt be looking at a rangefinder to begin with
  do you have any examples of scans you made with that im curious how well it worked
well lads i received the lx i bought off ebay the other day and it seems like its defective the shutter seems to get stuck open when shooting at 1/60 and 1/30 apparently that is a common issue with the lx which indicates an electronic problem    wew

  i would but nothings in focus    this is a fine doggo
  you should really ask the seller ask what exact lenses they are and get pictures and post them here im very familiar with 4x5 and larger format lenses so i can give you advice    even if theyre shit its still probably worth it tho

i was looking up the canon sureshot 130u and saw it had a caption mode which ive never heard of before but it seems like it imprints a caption on the photo like it would a date/time are there any other cameras that do this im wondering what it looks like but cant find any sample photos maybe ill just buy one i could use a beater point n shoot
  i remember we had a ps camera back in the 90s that imprinted text stuff like happy birthday and merry christmas  if i recall correctly it did it like with the time/date using 8segment leds to burn it into the photo

  yeah man i was very excited to get this camera and to have it doa is very discouraging i was already feeling a bit silly for spending so much on a 3040 years old camera now the prospect of having to send this one back and do it all over again is making it seem even more stupid  the shutter stays open and the mirror up the only way to get it to reset is to move the shutter speed dial to a different setting   i already contacted a pentax repair expert and he confirmed in an email this morning that it is almost certainly defective  im gonna contact the seller today i dont deal with ebay often in this case where the item was advertised as fully functioning is there any chance i can get the guy to pay for the return shipping    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesamsungcamera modelsamsungsmg930acamera softwareg930aucu4cri2maximum lens aperturef/17sensing methodonechip color areafocal length 35mm equiv26 mmimagespecific propertiesimage width2560image height1440image orientationrighthand tophorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage created20181009 232942exposure time1/10 secfnumberf/17exposure programnormal programiso speed rating400lens aperturef/17brightness22 evexposure bias0 evmetering modespotlight sourceunknownflashno flashfocal length420 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width2560image height1440exposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardunique image idc12qsjk01smtime utc212942date utc20181009

  top is plustek bottom is dslr scan setup only did a quick exposure adjustments and curve adjustments in lightroom for these couldnt find any colour examples from the scan rig but if i do ill post it      es1  lol that would mean id have to buy a macro lens too i was using one of those converters where you can attach the lens on backwards to the camera to make it macro  es1 plus a canon eos mount macro would of cost around the same price as a plustek besides my room is bloody small so the scanning rig was taking up a lot of room having to set it up everytime i wanted to scan was a pain making sure everything was aligned up properly was agonizing and i barely used my digi gear so i sold it

  sad to hear i guess its the nature of buying old gear that there is a risk it might not work hopefully you grab another one and that it works good luck anon
  post windmills   i am unapologetic about the border
  theres really no trick to it if your scene has too much dynamic range youre going to lose stuff expect blown out skies in quite a lot of mid day conditions expect fully black shadows in a lot of conditions  its often not a problem aesthetically to have some pure white and pure black in a photo
  in addition to what others say make sure you expose for what you want shadows will be extreme compared to negative film as will highlights so if you are shooting portraits then meter for the face if shooting landscapes meter for either the sky if you want a black foreground or for a sunny spot gives a nice chiaroscuro effect i love that negative film doesnt give or for the grass if you want greens to be middle grey etc winters coming so pay attention to snow  dont meter for it unless thats the intent everything else will be literally black otherwise meter for anything other than the snow  the snow will probably be just a huge mess of blown out white but i like that look and plan to take advantage of it this season shooting velvia 100

sup fellow /fgt/s    i recently accquired pic related for next to nothing unfortunately there seems to be a problem with the exposure time ring i can turn it to 1/30th but trying to turn it further isnt possible unless force is used and i dont want to break anything therefore i cant use 1/15th 1/8th and b    which might not be terrible since i didnt plan on getting this one for long time exposures but itd still be nice to have it fully working    anyone with an idea to fix this or had a similar problem with similar cameras
  see 
  youre either going to have to open it up and try to figure out whats wrong with the mechanism or youre going to have to send it to someone who knows how to do it
  it is an extremely common problem that slower shutter speeds do not work on pre80s mechanical cameras fixing it requires a clean and regreasing of the mechanism it is unlikely to be worth the money on such a camera

all right guys heads up for a stupid question i saw pic related and want to recreate the flat blue hue inb4 blue hour this was shot on expired film i think the best way to do this is to double expose a frame first shooting blue and then the subject however when i tried this in my digital cam it made the second shot incredibly dark im just wondering if the same would happen on film would i be able to just shoot a nice color on my computer and then go out and find a nice subject for the second exposure using the underexpose by one stop rule
  film has an exposure curve thats time and temp dependent temp and time will make the film lean towards a specific kind of color check for the film you want to use  if you want blue hues under normal conditions your best bet would be to use a filter i guess or post process for blue
  why develop while traveling isnt it easier to do it at home the xray problem at the airport is a meme
  did you find it on ebay
  or you could use a blue or whatever filter  with double exposures of course you lose contrast it doesnt necessarily mean the end photo will be darker but itll be lower contrast

  not him but here in asia i can get 1 hour dev easily though i have some worries about their cheap chemicals and whether it has an effect on quality the 2 ektar rolls i sent them seem to look different from what im used to
  it seriously is saw an old japanese codger shooting a pentax 67 and some tlr at one of the temples in kyoto and many film slrs and compacts film is everywhere and cheap but only fujifilm kodak and other imports are expensive af old gear by and large is not cheaper but the selection and condition is superb
  also yeah as anon said above film labs everywhere even in the smaller towns they do 1hr processing lots of print shops  im guessing japanese like to print their photos a lot more than in the west in aus  im from melbourne basically no one is printing photos and film labs are concentrated in the hipster inner city areas or in the city centre
  cheers will grab some  one of things on my to do list was to get into a medium format body while i was here any recommendations on a good value system to start with ive been looking at the yashica 124g a bit and some of the fuji fixed lens rangefinders but not sure exactly where to begin      i like the clouds and sky in this one thanks for the samples havent really started pushing c41 yet but keen to begin the grain doesnt seem to intrusive in these examples i really didnt like the grain in superia 800 any experience pushing portra 400 always wanted to try that

  well what were you trying to achieve
  exif data available click here to show/hide  the film looks fine to me    there are dust spots but thats more about handling your film more carefully after development before scanning  delta when shot and devved at 3200 is pretty contrasty so keep that in mind if you want more detail in the shadows and expose accordingly    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makeplustekcamera modelopticfilm 8100camera softwaresilverfast 880 r14 aug 31 2018  88cdfc4 3108imagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage width1200image height798
  8090 of the time with film these days its the scanning theres a lot of misinformation for people that do it themselves and labs phone it in unless you pay extra    delta 3200 at box speed is grainy as fuck but i find it particularly gorgeous
  well scanning is a skill after all so it takes some time to get used to adjusting colour balance and stuff so it looks good thats why there were/are specialized people that scan film and do that for you    the good thing is that once you get the hang of it its a lot better than lab scanning since now you get to do the colours/contrast/etc the way you want them and your photos come out the way you want them to look
  even back in the day of predigitalization you had dedicated people for printing they knew exactly how to dodge and burn fix colour contrast etc  not all hobbyist or pros were darkroom masters it was more common to work alongside with a good darkroom specialist and just give guidelines or corrections in the contact sheet

  man just shoot digital
    nice ones    how do you guys keep graininess in check
overexposing 3 stops
  mine was shot and devved at 1600 which i find best for tmax 3200  even if you shoot and dev at 3200 cause you need the shutter speed if for a frame or two the light allows overexpose a stop youll get a nicer negative    also developer plays a role speed enhancing and fine grain ones are the best suited i use xtol which is both undiluted for that specific roll to further reduce grain  there are not huge differences between developers of the same category though so as long as you dont do retarded shit like rodinal with high speed tgrain films youll be fine

  have handled one before they look feel and operate brilliantly albeit with a small viewfinder but i cant help but be anxious at possibility of it dying out of nowhere and being left with a thousand dollar brick id sooner buy a leica m3 but thats a different kind of camera entirely
  just buy a bessa r and enjoy manual focus and cheap lenses in a very similar looking package that wont brick on you
  this might be cool with some burning/horizon correction and a slight crop
  at least bring it up with him or go to ebay/paypal and say you got a defective device that was listed as functioning you might get it all back

    yes but also depends on the price the g lenses  45mm especially  are some of the best g1 bodies can be replaced for less than 200 right now if something goes wrong mines been shooting strong for the last few years despite being around water cold sand etc i wouldnt say theyre as fragile as people make them out to be however theyre not as tough as a bessa or leica in that they rely on electronics more     if the price for body and lens is around 500 or less for the body and 28mm or 45mm its worth it its a fun camera to shoot with you can treat it as a ps with nice glass or shoot fully manual or somewhere in between
a recent cn roll of mine has these red spots what causes them bad dev/chemicals bad dyes damaged by humidity/heat  this is the second time ive run into this problem both with ektar if it means anything    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makenoritsu kokicamera modelez controllercamera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2017 windowsimagespecific propertiesimage width4832image height4760number of bits per component8 8 8pixel compositionrgbimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage created20181129 225826color space informationsrgbimage width1000image height1000
  thats herpes sorry anon
  damn next time ill tell the seller to stop using merchandise as butt plug
  is it expired
  no its dated for 2019
  yeah ive never seen this did you dev yourself if not tell the lab about it
i just got an enlarger recently and i cant get it to focus at any size higher than 11cm wide with 35mm the lens is backed up all the way at this point what could be causing this i hope its not just the upper limit of what it can project that would be fucking useless
  i figured it out the lens mount was the wrong way around
  the lens mount might be the wrong way round
i havent seen much posted about ektachrome here lately has anyone been shooting it and developed a roll yet
  anyone know the dynamic range of it
  about five stops
  yeah i got scared for a second that thats just what amateur enlargers are like i bought it without reading much about it
  shits bloody expensive 20 australian for a roll i could get 4 rolls of colourplus with that money
  ill have my first roll of it back in a few days
  good luck with calc s
  a friend brought me in there im a comms major lol ill pass the word
  i know ur from van so where is this specifically poco or something      really like this one
can anyone explain to me why the contax g2 is so special

  nice rare photo of central asias cheese mine cheese miners are shy and rarely caught on film
  ektarportra
  what a dumb thing to say
  can you find me a similar camera i cant
  youre right its too nice for you anyway
noob question if i have a roll of 200 iso in my camera and i change the iso setting on the camera what effect would that have     also i picked up some aps film because i had no idea what it was i had no idea this stuff even existed the only thing i could think of was putting a roll through my broken royal 35m as far as i can tell it took pictures and advanced the film what are the odds they actually come out
  changing the iso on your camera changes how the camera exposes the film but obviously not the film itself so if you turn it one stop higher than the rated iso it will be one stop underexposed and vice versa so if you want to deliberately push or pullprocess your film you can set it to where you want it to be and adjust your developing accordingly     note this only applies to cameras with builtin meters for older allmanual cameras the iso usually asa or din in those days does nothing other than helping you remember what iso film is in your camera
  cant tell if this is bait or not but what the hay  for the iso question see   as so the aps question it wont work in your royal camera and youll need to get an aps camera aps film is what apsc cropped sensor digital cameras are based off of   id highly to not bother with aps since the film itself is expired aps cameras are pretty garbage since theyre the same size as 35mm cameras but the negate is way smaller and no one develops aps film anymore and for those places who still do its very expensive

what do you guys use for negative filing/naming systems in the physical sense and scanning names i shoot 35mm 120 and 4x5 both color and bw so i would like to organize them     yearc or bwformatroll number    something like this thats easily searchable and organized wheres my accounting photographers at
  digitally just dump them into an external hdd i have folders for each camera and then name them as yearmonthplace/themefilmspeed so for example as a made up example i could have a folder ricoh r1 and under that 201803roadtriphp5800    i mark my negs with developer dilution time temperature and that stuff since thats where that info is relevant i have all that in a binder sorted roughly by date theres always some overlap between rolls    c41 so far just goes into a shoebox i dont shoot enough of it to care ill probably get another binder for those eventually though
  glassine sleves on which i write the date and sometimes location sleves go in a box 1 box per year boxes are labelled with the year
  i started naming the sheets and then stopped a bit later on after i discovered im not organized enough to put film back in the correct sleeve after scanning in the computer i name the file based upon subject everything goes in a big folder and is ctrlfd for  im beyond salvation
  raw scans are sorted by emulsion edited shots are just exported to a single folder with the emulsion as the file name  physical negative are in folders for each year the sheet is labeled with the emulsion a brief 23 word summery of whats on the roll and the date if i can remember to write it down
  how do i make my asa 100 film not look like ass
  by not underexposing then raising exposure in post
  hm makes sense  thanks
  what film is this btw and is it expired
  cheapass imation 100/21 film new its the only thing i can get easily cheaply and in quantity in my shit third world country no one knows how lucky they are with their kodak 400 film

  you have some more examples
  yeah but only because i dont have a meter  too scared to process the film xd
        composition and scans look a little blurry stop using lab scans
all right /p/ros theres this girl ediesunday on instagram who does these shots and gets these crazy tones she shoots all analog and claims that she only uses photoshop to adjust contrast brightness and saturation she is super secretive about her technique but surely someone on this board would be able to figure it out im thinking its something she does when developing perhaps off temperatures of chemicals
  combo of expired film loogs like crossprocessing or chemical contamination in some id bet some baking of the film too prolly some lomo meme film as the base    oh and not focusing the lens and underexposure
  basically doing everything wrong when it comes to shooting handling and processing film    if you want to emulate the look just experiment wanting to get the exact recipe for something like this defeats the whole purpose
  i think the difference between a flash meter and a normal meter is that a flash meter has a sync socket on it  at least that seemed to be the difference between the spotmeter m and spotmeter f to me
has anyone here pushed portra 400 ive got an evening/night shoot coming up and want to keep speeds up planning on pushing 1 stop but has anyone had good results pushing 2
  what about the composition and where should i get it scanned then
so ilford bumped their prices and a 30m roll of hp5 is now 85 instead of 71 the latter price was good enough that i didnt really even consider shooting anything else after rpx400 was bumped to 65 for 30m but with the price hike im again thinking if i should look at getting something else next time    so what are my options should be  cubic grain  work well in hc110  push to 1600 nicely
  foma 400 but i wouldnt push it to more than 1600    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cs51 windowsimagespecific propertiesimage width2191image height3352compression schemeuncompressedpixel compositionunknownimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution2400 dpivertical resolution2400 dpiimage data arrangementchunky formatimage created20171216 175253color space informationuncalibratedimage width667image height1000

  thats like what a fiver for a roll bulk loading now only saves like 15 for every 30m so 1/5th more shooting for the same money still worth it if you have nice bulk carts but otherwise meh    spose the price will come down one day
  i need to give it a serious experiment ive mostly read  seen bad things about it but i need to see how itd work for me personally i tend to go for quite harsh textures and hard contrast hence the pushing so the things that bother many people about it might not matter to me as much i might get a 17m roll of either that or the 200 which ive already shot a bit of next time i order supplies the 200 seems quite decent and flexible at least but not sure i could comfortably push it past 800    i already have shot a couple of rolls of the 400 but in 120 and only at box speed so that might not tell as much but need to develop those when i get to it and see what the negs look like    what about the orwo stuff and the agfa apx400 was it so that the agfa is the same stock as rollei rpx400
  if i remember correctly rpx 400 is made by ilford well harman to be exact  i think its an old cubic grain recipe so i guess similar to ilford pan 400 and hp5    the retro line is an original agfa recipe polyester base small tgrain high contrast created by agfa gevaert for industrial applications aerophotogroahy traffic cameras etc thus the extended red sensitivity  pretty cool films dry quickly and absolutely flat and easy to scan  they dont retain lots of shadow detail if you push them though thats their only drawback if you go for high contrast youll prolly like them though    the new agfa films red dot agfa logic instead of rhombus are just rebranded kentmere if i remember right
  a brick is 3750eur whereas the 305m roll is 4295eur at fotoimpex shipping
  fomapan sure is overpriced when sold prerolled i was talking more about rpx 400 and hp5 with the new prices fomapan 400 being even worse a deal doesnt honestly surprise me at all might get me a brick of it though because the dxcoded carts will surely be useful in the future      the stocks previously known as apx 100 and apx 400 are now rpx 100 and rpx 400 and made by a different company using different equipment and probably different precursors as well the current apx 100 and 400 are some lowcost but decent on par with pan 400 film from either harman or agfagevaerts factories with agfas old brands stuck on top apx 25 didnt make it and rpx 25 is a new or special purpose aerial or scientific photography etc stock rebranded into rolleis vision of the series    i dont believe rpx is made by harman it could still be agfagevaert as for orwo i have very little clue
  the foma cartridges arent dx coded
  retro line is cgrain no
  no  theyre not traditional cubic grain theyre a version of tgrain tgrain is a kodak trademark but similar technology    but theyre not like traditional grain films in graininess
hey /p/ anyone know what model this is
what monitors do you guys use i need a good color accurate monitor for when i scan my film in and im not sure what to get ive been using a 2015 mac book pro for a few years but i want something bigger
anyone got a good source of hc110 in australia   only place ive found is from the jews at vanbar which have it for 40 plus like 30 freight because theyre retarded and dont use auspost to ship their shit   im down to 500ml of xtol so i need more developer ive heard good things about hc110 so id like to try it out also thinking about picking up some rodinal for the meme other developer recommendations are welcome
  im using a 9 year old dell ultrasharp the line has always been quite good colour wise unless you have a high budget id pick any good non gamer oriented ips screen most have about 100 srgb coverage these days and quite a few adobergb too  in case you arent currently calibrating screens  no amount of money will get you an accurate monitor calibration is what brings accuracy a bottom of the barrel calibrated screen will do better than a high end uncalibrated screen for sure  try and calibrate your current screen to see how far you can get only after that consider getting a better one
      so i did some more research it seems that that is generally correct a flash meter is for measuring light when using a flash a normal meter is for other cases    whether or not there is any overlap depends entirely on the models in question some flash meters have a spot meter the ability to list light values for both the flash and natural light separately and other neat features others are useful only in a studio environment    it seems the best two choices are either the sekonic l508 or the minolta flash meter vi both are rather on the pricey side though
  i use an asus proart display it comes color calibrated from the factory they even ship a calibration report sheet with it got it calibrated with the design guys i used to work with back when i got it they said it was almost spot on    i was blown away the first time i turned it on and had my 2012 macbook pro hooked up to it side by side the colors were completely different between each screen like a whole world apart and not just the temps couldnt believe how off the mbp was first time i understood how important color calibration was to my workflow
its not bait im literally clueless    it wont work the shutter opened and shut and presumably exposed the film to what the camera was pointed at what extra step is required with aps film but i agree with your opinion im not going to bother with it in future

  color negative films dont have true colors  if you want them to look like what you want youll have to scan yourself not leaving it to labs
  yes that is quintessentially portra what were you expecting
  well this is the previous roll of portra i shot and it was more or less the same conditions golden hourish i switched from superia because thats too saturated for me and i wished something more yellow rather than magenta previous negative wasnt very dense so i set iso 200 for the meter does portra shift so dramatically towards cyan when overexposed by one single stop or should i just drop the lab scans like  suggests even if id rather pay those extra bucks than spend two hours scanning myself each time    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertiescolor space informationsrgbimage width997image height1500
  of course the film changes characteristics when overexposed portra 400 has a typical cyan cast in the mids and highlights by overexposing one stop youre letting more of the scene into the midtown range    its really impossible to comment on scans if its done by a third party no clue how much of it is autoexposure / auto white balance on their end judge the negatives not third party scans or scan yourself and have complete control over the digitization process
  dont sweat it too much  a flash meter is a normal light meter that also hasnt flash metering most have a pc socket to trigger your flashes from the meter m to take a reading some dont    so apart from the flash metering function a normal light meter has two modes incident metering and reflected metering    in incident mode the white dome is covering the light sensor then you walk to where you subject is point the meter to the camera where youll be standing when taking the pic and take a reading this will give you a correct exposure regardless of the subjects reflectivity black cat in coal mine white rabbit in snow etc and you dont have to do any thinking or use a grey card to get the right exposure   the disadvantage is you have to walk to where te subject is and thats not always possible for instance when taking a landscape shot with far away mountains or an architectural shot but in studio or any controlled environment people use incident mentoring pretty much exclusively    in reflected mode you slide the dome to the side and expose the light sensor then you point the meter towards your scene and you meter jut as youd meter with the inbuilt light meter in any camera  you try to point it to something resembling middle grey to get the correct exposure you have to account for subject reflectivity though as usual ie if you point it at something very bright and use those settings without adjustment youll get an underexposed shot  think of it like that the light meter will try to convert everything its pointed at to middle gray point it to snow and itll give you an exposure that results in the snow being grey and everything else underexposed point to a black building and itll result in an exposure turning the building grey and everything else overexposed   essentially all builtin light meters phones dslrs are reflected meters      lastly there are lightmeters that also do spot metering
  would that be more to your liking    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution72 dpvertical resolution72 dpcolor space informationsrgbimage width1000image height773
  lastly there are lightmeters that also do spot metering  just get one of those and never look back they are more pricey but worth it learn the zone system and youre done
  it is objectively true
  tfw falling for a meme and being stuck with 30 rolls of a film i dont even like  fuck me oh well its gonna be more photoshop for the next 10 months i guess thanks for the info
  what a dumb followup
  i use the zone system for all my work but it is pretty damn slow to be honest its nice to know for sure that your exposure is good though
  being stuck with 30 rolls of a film i dont even like  iktf  bought 20 rolls of 400h but after using 3 rolls i found that its too flat like black points are not black but greyish now i have to save it for portrait occassions when ektar gets too red for skin tones at least their exp is way until 2020
as someone who owns a hasselblad 500cm is there anything i could possibly get out of a mamiya rb67 part of me really wants a 6x7 camera but i dont know if thered actually be any reason to upgrade
my ricoh 500gs has this weird light meter problem /p/ gave me the right battery for the meter 675 button cell but the meter reads in a limited range in the green zone the needle works totally fine but the needle does not go into the red zone ive pointed the camera at bright lights and used a light meter to confirm that the needle isnt moving past f/4 on the scale when it should is this a mechanical problem with the meter i have a roll of expired ultramax 400 to shoot
  here is the camera because i am a gear fag
  well fuck to that then      order with a fellow filmfag order two and sell the other for price  shipping  15 order two and develop 200 rolls dil b like a boss
    the rb67 is fuckhuge and heavy especially compared to the blad though 6x7 is nice because you dont really have to crop when enlarging to 8x10
  im not sure how much heaver an rb is than a rz but i find the rz quite easy to hand hold and lug around theyre a lot bigger than a hasselblad that much is for sure
  pls halp
  hey i totally misunderstood you i apologize i didnt take that picture that image was scanned from a magazine so there might be a lot of differences
  some old minoltas with the needle meter have this problem where the foam around the prism housing craps out and gets the needle stuck or limit its travel    im not familiar with rangefinders but its worth a shot checking out if there isnt anything sticky in there messing with the needle
    kodak ektralite 400
    thank you very much 3
can i use a cheap neewer flash trigger on my minoltas hot shoe to trigger an external flash
  yeah
  cool thanks
  this scene looks so god damned big
  i own both and still find uses for the rb its a lovely format and definitely still has its pros
  just get ilford hc or lc29 off digidirect/michaels/wherever
  the last one on the bottom is polaroid film the opacifier layer failure streaks of blue are evidence of this
  does it exhibit the same performance with no battery at all
  ilford hc  75 for 1l  lc29  45 for 500ml  xtol   19 for 5l  yeah fuck that shit ill stick with xtol
  xtol is better anyway actually its the best pyrocathd in a very close second very useful for semicompensating work and fog scenes

  depends on what you are using it for
  you can adjust all this via software before scanning       price is ok personally i prefer colorplus over gold and these are about the same price just test it
  are you seriously suggesting that a flatbed scanner can compete with a drumscanner
  my plan is to mainly use it in long exposures since digital sucks there
  where did you read that all i said is that as there is shadow detail in the negative you could improve the flatbed scan by adjusting the levels before scanning it  you wont get the same resolution/detail but both scanners scan the same negative and the drum scanner doesnt magically make shadow detail appear my guess is that the drum scan was adjusted whereas in the flatbed scan the levels are unchanged
  it looks great but its born the drumscanning its the person operating the scanner  i dont think there exists any incompetent person aperating a drum scanner same canr be said for minilabs and consumer scanners    i completely agree with your point about slides though a drum scanner can pierce through dense slides easily

  its not a negative its a velvia sheet good luck recovering shadow detail at the same level as a drum scanner with a flatbed i encourage you you will have a revelation
  negative/positive thats splitting hairs while missing the general point dont get upset there is no doubt about the drum scan being better you can easily try it in the end it only improves the quality of your flatbed scans i dont remember if epson scan offers this option but in silverfast you can easily adjust overall exposure to recover highlight detail and mids to recover some of the shadow detail

  read this and look at the examples you have absolutely no idea what youre talking about   
  i wrote it before the drum scan quality is better and there is no doubt about that all i said was that by adjusting expoaure and levels before you scan the slide you can recover parts of the highlights and shadows   as your link states most cheap and some not so cheap scanners cannot access the very darkest parts of a transparency   in  not all stuff in the foreground is the very darkest parts and it might be possible to recover some detail
  hes saying that you can get better scans with the flatbed if you adjust scanning parameters he is not saying that the flatbed is just as good as a drum scanner  in other words its advice on how to get optimal flatbed scans by adjusting scan settings  please improve your reading comprehension
  implying that wasnt done when it was scanned on the epson  implying implications
  was it
  i havent implied but maybe youve insinuated  if those arent your photos

  ok well i took the liberty to try some ps on the flatbed scan colors in the shadows are certainly not as good as those in the drum scan but there is more shadow detail than it seems in the original version posted above  of course doing that in post introduces a fair amount of noise so im wondering if youre using the digital versions for prints depending on the display size both online and print that noise might be less prominent    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2019 windowsimagespecific propertiesimage width795image height1000number of bits per component8 8 8pixel compositionrgbimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution240 dpivertical resolution240 dpiimage created20181203 224615color space informationsrgbimage width795image height1000
  you cannot print slides anymore so yes digital files for prints
  never checked on any kind of color paper in that case i totally get why you need drum scans especially when you want to print big for online display the flatbed scans probably do ok
  the last production of ilfochrome was in 2012 printing on ra4 paper is a waste of time unless you are doing contacts film/digital hybrid workflow is much better imo
  please improve your reading comprehension  you and your buttbuddy tripfag first  the original post was about shadow extraction on slides retard jumped in blathering about negatives and some mumbo jumbo basics about exposure as if its relevant or anyone owns an epson didnt that  now retards backpedalling lmao
  alright but you should recognise that thats a different goalpost
  scanning and digital printing is always better quality than optical printing thats why it has been the standard since the 80s
  sounds like it saves a lot of hassle how large do you print from these      nobody is backpedaling now that everything is sorted out and we engaged in a normal conversation on the topic you come along and try to recook the whole thing stfu
  why is it always better than optical printing just ordered some paper as i want to try wet printing
  at least for bw wet printing completely blows digital out of the water
    i contacted the guy and he was cool about it it wasnt his fault and i believe him when he says it was working when he sent it i returned it to him and he refunded me in full including shipping  he messaged me and said the issue was something with the shutter speed control armature seemed like a simple fix and he had it working the same day he got it back    i ended up buying another off ebay for slightly cheaper this one came from keh i got it today and im pretty pleased since it is in better cosmetic condition than the first one  of course it isnt without its own issues i started testing it out and the mirror started sticking when the shutter release is pressed another very common issue with the lx apparently the little rubber stops that the mirror rest on get sticky with age and the mirror sticks to them just enough for it to get hung up  luckily i was able to at least temporarily fix the problem by rubbing the stops with the graphite tip of a pencil no more stick  this camera could probably use a good cla treatment soon but it seems to be fully functional for now    time to start shooting again    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makenoritsu kokicamera modelqss32_33camera softwareqss32_33  801001 20080115imagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpicolor space informationsrgbimage width3091image height2048
  nah total bs despite whatever your favorite analog youtube memelord might have told you a high end scanner can always extract more detail from a piece of film than an enlarger and modern dye sub paper is higher resolution and lasts longer than any photographic paper     darkroom printing is fun dont get me wrong but dont have delusions about quality darkroom work including shooting film in general is a historical curiosity and its relegated to hobbyists that are mostly more focused on process than results nowadays
  i think in some cases contact printing can beat scanning youre losing the main downside of darkroom work there the lens

  oh shit hes back with another lx listen guy the lightseals have degraded its almost expected google lightseal replacements ive followed the mattsclassiccameras guide its really easy and you can do it yourself for dirt cheap if your mirror rest has degraded theres a good chance the lightseals on your door are gooey too so hold off on shooting a roll until you get the replaced otherwise youll probably have light leaks all over your shots personally i bought a sheet of felt with an adhesive side prestofelt and have replaced all seals a mirror rests on a few cameras with it some people are wary of using felt as its kind of a loose material and it may not dampen the mirror as much as foam but ive never had issues and if a piece does lint off you can just blow it out

i cant afford developing so ive shot around 300 rolls over the past 5 years without developing them    will they go bad over time
  no theyll be fine but what sort of cognitive impairment do you suffer from
  so nice v50scapes make me hard        i agree with the other anon the processing on these is so different im finding it hard to compare them do you have a couple of crops to compare detail i actually use a v550 for my landscapes and am finding it resolves detail very poorly but drum scanners are so so expensive its not even worth considering
  well as someone who prints only bw only about 250 prints in i wouldnt say its always better but it usually is and often its also so much simpler theres no contest the whole ra4 process is even more of a hassle though there are tools to help combat it obviously    you can certainly get great prints on a good enlarger and a good lens fiber paper etc but for color im not sure you can ever reach the technical details you get with something like a drum scan and for positives its also the only possible way to do it anymore unless you have a secret stash of ilfochrome somewhere and lets not forget all the post processing like how to dry flatten etc a fiber print or how shitty spotting is compared to doing it digitally    could it be possible that optical printing would reach the quality level of scanning probably is anyone working on researching and improving that technology anymore not really    but printing is a lot more fun and creative i dont think a hybrid workflow will ever get there combining the most boring and tedious parts of both processes  developing film scanning it and then clicking around in ps or whatever you personally use
im retarded please help ive used a 500ml 120 batch to develop a single roll do i have to multiply the development time by 14 for the second one    
in this thread we take photos and use extreme color curves and editing to make abstract and interesting images  ill post a bunch of examples to start off
  all of these are very scaled down if you want the full size image just ask
  you can even reuse old images and get new and interesting results with some different cropping
  like this
  alright thats all ive got for now i can explain my method and show some steps if theres interest
  i find this stuff pretty neat care to share your process id like to try it out
  i do it all on mobile using an app called snapseed its a powerful app for photo editing in general i also take my photos on mobile so i can take advantage of compression artifacts and noise  first i start with a picture the more structured your picture it will come through very clearly thats why i like this blurry low light stuff  heres my example photo
  from there i use extreme color curves to fuck up the colors bring out all the noise and artifacts
  i used to do that back when i was a kid now that im an adult i thought i shouldnt be doing that anymore guess i was wrong
  from there its just whatever tweaks and flairs you want  tips  dont oversaturate your photos and make sure to leave some dark space  once you have done your curves you can convert to bw and then recolor with the color curves again  use the details tool in snapseed to get rid of excess noise it doesnt always work but its good  lighter photos are generally less noisy than darker phtos  always crop to show the most interesting parts often youll get these big seas of noisy color that are too busy    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwaresnapseed 20imagespecific propertiesimage created20181128 195608image width1091image height1456

  use your smartphone
  get an old canon rebel and a used prime
  this  also consider the pana g7 that goes for very cheap these days
  what is a prime
  a number
  pana g7  a friend got one recently but lenses are expensive
  get a speed booster that matches to canon ef or nikon f and in the former case get some rokinon cine prime lenses and in the latter case get preai manual primes in the former consider something like their 24mm and their 85mm and then a 35 or 50 in between to fill the gap in the latter a 50mm 14 preai along with maybe a 24mm and an 85 this all costs 500ish minus speed booster which should be 250300 now you have literally everything youll need ever    or rent lenses if youre serious and ready to shoot but dont have the materials yet
  a lens that does not zoom such as a 50mm lens
  why would someone want lenses that dont zoom
  because i have legs
  i too can defy gravity and walk into thin air and also never shoot in any situations where i am physically obstructed
  also never shoot in any situations where i am physically obstructed  your photo wouldnt of been good anyway
  why would someone want lenses that dont zoom  real answer prime lenses are optically simpler so you can make a prime thats a optically better b has a wider aperture so better in low light c for cheaper    in the context of this discussion since serious filmmakingtype video work is usually done manually focused anyway you can get a really good cheap manualfocus prime lens from yesteryear whereas zoom lenses from the same era tend to be optically shitty      wouldnt of
  wouldnt of
    ignore this retard    but i would agree its nice to shoot with a prime to help with composition while learning although zooming with your legs wont apply to many situations 
smartphone demo unit on ebay
someone told me a phone x can take better pictures than a canon t6 were they right
  no
  to add to this maybe pretend to be homeless and jump the next weird hipster that comes to take a picture of you 9/10 they wont even put up a fight
im looking to get into photography and filmmaking  hurrdurr why wouldnt i want to zoom  if you dont understand focal length you use your phone learn and then you can play with the big kids
  so wanting to zoom  not understanding focal length gotcha ur a good teacher
  lol it sounds like you are the one who actually doesnt understand focal length with this dumb fucking nonsense post
  the sentiment expressed was literally  why would someone want lenses that dont zoom  which yes pretty strongly implies that you dont understand focal length it definitely means you dont understand lenses in general since the answer to that is super obvious id you do and given that you probably also dont understand focal length and just think of zoom range in terms of this lets me take video of things farther away     nothing wrong with wanting a zoom lens being unable to understand why one might want a nonzoom lens displays ignorance
  which yes pretty strongly implies that you dont understand focal length  you just keep saying the same thing over and over without explaining what you think he doesnt understand about focal length
  im not saying the same thing over and over again theres more than one anon in this thread besides this post i only posted  and     the thing i would assume mr whywouldyoueverwantaprime doesnt understand about focal length is that the main reason to use it is not to take pictures of things that are farther away from you but rather to control your perspective a wide angle lens will give a much different look to the items in the shot than a short telephoto for instance and theyll both look different from a lens with a normal field of view wanting a zoom lens doesnt mean that thats definitely the caseafter all a given focal length well subject to camera distance which is affected by field of view which is a function of focal length and format size but lets not get distracted will provide the same perspective whether its a zoom or a prime but the difference between a zoom and prime and why you might want to use one or the other tends to be something one learns early on around the same time one learns about the relationship between perspective and focal length before learning that people tend to just think zoom good more zoom more good

i have never taken a good photo in my entire life
  i go on modelmayhem to browse the nudes

i just come here to shitpost in fact i dont even know what a camera is
mfw i often imagine myself as bresson of this century
  i spent over 100 on 4x5 gear chemistry and film not counting the camera itself and have yet to shoot a single sheet months later ive had the camera itself about two years now without ever shooting a single sheet
  bought new camera late 2016  shutter count still under 5000
have been shooting photos as a hobby for 15 years  have been approached for prints numerous times and have made thousands of dollars selling them  have never shot raw
i only do cosplay photography to fuck nerd chicks
when i say great thread i dont actually mean it
  great post
    please suck eachothers cocks or at least get in bed together

theres nothing wrong in using live view most of the time on a dslr

  i have a leica kit but dont use it for the fear of damaging it
  photography is an intrinsically expensive hobby and i cant afford it but i try anyway with my smartphone also i dont like this board gear oriented attitude towards photography and the lack of positive constructive critique and the elitism towards those that are at the beginning of the learning curve but here i am anyways

got a photo featured on national geographic  critique was good  photo is slightly out of focus
  couldnt you just spend 200 on a camera with a kit lens and pay 200 less for the phone youre using  i keep hearing this shit from people who buy the latest iphones but heres my opinion  if you really care about photography you would have gotten a real camera and a dirt cheap phone thats what i did at least
  awesome man how does one get their photo featured on there
  ironically youre being the gearfag by only wanting the best gear and not shopping to your budget    any camera after 2011 will be fine for you i started out with a sony nex 5n which is peanuts with a kit lens on ebay and meant i could move up to an a6000 easy my friend started with a canon 450d also peanuts throw in some vintage lenses and you havent spent much at all    and you dont need the latest and greatest phones these days look into xiaomi phones flagship specs for fuck all just be a smart consumer to your budget instead of whining theres always a way to do photography
  literally how
  should add my friend bought the 450d and used those yongnuo lenses for a long time which are dirt cheap and surprisingly high quality where theres a will theres a way
  holy shit this people dont mind spending 700 so they can use snapchat fb and instagram with zero lag but balk at spending more than 100 on a camera and decry it as cost prohibitive unless anon owns a cheaper phone but i hear the same thing all the time as well ffs some of the new iphones cost as much as a prosumer body and lens
  i got into photography while unemployed and barely making ends meet because i wanted a reason to walk outside and stop watching daytime tv like a loser if i can do it rich kids with the latest iphone can    i mean looking at /rpt/ very few of us are using the very latest gear and most of us are using at least 2 or 3 models back or more
im still lusting for a sigma 16 14 and 56 14 even though i dont need them since the 30 14 and the sonygger kit lens is enough for my needs have you ever been in this situation how do i stop this itch desu what do
    nigga by next week just shoot something  anything
  i havent posted on /p/ in years

i got given an old pentax camera because i wanted to use the lenses on my canon figured i should use the pentax to shoot atleast once i had a lady at the camera store show me how to load the film in it
ive turned down paid gigs because i felt i didnt have the exactly right gear for the job
          couldnt you  what if i got interested in photography after i bought my current smartphone what if i got it with a carrier plan so i didnt have to shell out hundreds of dollars at once what if the smartphone itself wasnt a thousand dollars iphone but way cheaper than that  nope i am the gearfag because i didnt spend hundreds of dollars i dont have on equipment which apparently comes before anything else because sure a smartphones camera is the most basic of the tools and it sucks im not here to deny it but its a camera nonetheless and you can work around it after all photographys principles are not tightly bound to the type of camera however it doesnt matter you need a dslr and a kit lens but then its ditch that shitty kit lens and get a fast prime and so on its neverending really it just serves the purpose of getting some distance from the masses because now everyone has a smartphone so you need to be a step ahead you perfectly demonstrated what i meant with my post gear oriented attitude and elitism
  did you get distracted by a facebook notification when i suggested adapted vintage lenses its really not expensive to get a used camera from 2011 and some vintage canon or nikon glass with an adapter vintage 50mm f18s are everywhere for pocket change and simple to focus with focus peaking thats all     sorry i tried to help a fellow poorfag get into real photography and break the myth youre spouting that its intrinsically expensive when it really isnt

  people dont seem to balk at putting video games before anything else or going out clubbing every weekend or buying weed or any other pleasurable pursuit that costs money i know people who splurged on a nintendo switch and still ask me how i can justify buying a camera as if its some obscene expense its really not a lot for an entry level kit especially because camera bodies rapidly lose their value a week after release especially in the used market    like any hobby photography itself isnt expensive you can invest as little or as much as you want to thats the point of any hobby really multiple entry points for every income level

im not samefagging my photothreads and posts and theyre unresponded mostly
  what if i got interested in photography after i bought my current smartphone  then you can sell the smartphone to get money to buy a camera    what if i got it with a carrier plan so i didnt have to shell out hundreds of dollars at once  heh people actually use those if you can afford a carrier plan then you can afford a camera too if not give up in the carrier plan and save money for the camera    what if the smartphone itself wasnt a thousand dollars iphone but way cheaper than that  in that case you can buy a shitty point  shoot camera that still beats away any phone by orders of magnitude    theres no argument for defending smartphones they are useless facebook machines they arent even useful as music players since the cheap phones have trashtier sound quality and expensive ones dont even have headphone jack    btw im probably one of the poorest person in this board the only smartphone i have is so slow that isnt even usable and i only have it because i got it for free yet i managed to save money to buy a dslr
  the real patrician way to do it is buy a chink phone with flagship tier specs for 1/3 of the normal price like the pocophone f1 then get a one month rolling sim only deal people who sign themselves up for 2448 month contracts just to get a new phone are total brainlets imo
i do boudoir shots for prostitutes because they usually offer to pay with sex

  ive been so poor i had to live off food stamps and digging expired food out of the dumpsters behind supermarkets at 4am still kept up photography i found an old canon sure shot film camera for 5 and used the cheapest film possible     i get it being poor sucks hard but when you truly love something you find a way to do it no matter what

    thats actually not a bad idea you could do a daido moriyamaesque set involving sex workers shed light on an otherwise unknown sect of american life kind of like how i did with the trucking industry    i would pursue that further anon

  like how i did with the trucking industry  nobody thinks that  i hope you dont break your arm jerking yourself off

ive started taking pics 8 years ago and only shot a bit over 100 rolls
  man could you imagine if other artists thought like photographers do    i started painting six years ago and only made like 50 really nice paintings (((  ive been in the music industry for 10 years and only put out 5 solid albums    etc etc
  ive been in the music industry for 10 years and only ever played 3600 times
  implying those 100 rolls werent all snapshits
my company gives me a massive budget for photography even though an iphone 5 is capable of delivering the shots they need so i just mindlessly spend that money year after year on equipment that i have no idea how to use ive been shooting with an a7rii for a few months now with 2 lenses worth 5k combined thinking of picking up a telephoto for 3k and just learned about aperture time to go buy the new gopro 7 too even though i have the 35 and 6 already thinking of some car mounted gimbals too
  cameras ive bought    fujifilm xe2 with fujinon xf 14mm f28r  regular a7 with the kit 2870mm  a6300 with the kit lens  canon 5d mark iii with the ef 2470mm  p900  p1000    probably some other ones but i cant recall off the top of my head just picked up a rx100 6th gen too shit sucks by far my favorite camera was the fujifilm with that lens everything i did just came out amazing with it the worst was the a6300
  a painter whos only painted 50 things in the six years since they first took up painting wouldnt be a very good painter     assuming they didnt already have a solid drawing/sketching/etc background but 50 paintings over the course of six years is noooot enough to learn how to paint well
  thats why something like abstract and pop art paintings exist as an excuse compared to renaissance style paintings
    start looking at really right stuff or gitzo tripods ballheads brackets etc thats some fancy expensive stuff that will at least be practical in the future
  what the fuck are you working as
   years and only put out 5 solid albums  album every 2 years probably touring and recording during      only 125 rolls a year    i dont know man thats a pretty good rate
i buy more film than i shoot i shoot more film than i develop i develop more film than i scan i scan more film than i share the final image with people
  i said 50 good ones not 50 period the point is that qualityquantity but only photographers seem to think they need tens of thousands of photographs and all of them need to be seen by others
  but were talking about 100 rolls period not 100 good rolls you can paint the same canvas over and over again until the end result is good but in most photography you need quantity to get to quality take westons pepper no30 its a fucking pepper in his fucking home a still life where everything is under control and yet it took him 50 shots to get it right
  yet it took him 50 shots to get it right  he took him 50 shots to be satisfied with the result i bet that if not any most of those shots could have been considered as good by the broad public
trying to get my work published in various forms for years  friend writes a book asks if he can use one of my snapshit portraits if him while sending to agents  sure man knock yourself out glhf  ends up getting a four book deal  has pro portraits taken but they use my shot in the dust jacket of all his books  published internationally hundreds of thousands of copies sold    this this isnt how i wanted it to happen
  in most photography you need quantity to get quality  according to what practice does not make perfect good practice accompanied by good teaching makes perfect     pepper no 30  youre talking about an era where automated meters didnt even exist yet with so much of the technical stuff being automated now what separates good from bad is not being in focus or well exposed its composition and light
  thats because photography unlike real art forms doesnt require real talent youre not creating anything there is literally no artistic skill involved all youre doing is pushing a button and the good photographs come from snapping as much as possible and getting lucky with a few here and there over time you learn to anticipate which snaps will become good photographs which is when the ego kicks in and the photog becomes selfenamored with his photographic prowess
  according to what practice does not make perfect good practice accompanied by good teaching makes perfect  okay but you still need the practice to go along with the teaching ansel adams himself could descend from heaven to personally drill you on the camera the negative and the print and youd still have to take a shitload of bad pictures before you started getting good    if you really think that practicing photography doesnt make a difference to the quality of photography you produce im relatively certain you havent practiced your photography enough

  wow you sure are projecting something insane there my dude just because you or people you know cannot take a decent photo consciously and have to spray and pray until you/they get lucky doesnt mean its the same for anyone    good photographs etc  right its subjective photography is a big circlejerk and people get on high horses on the other hand a lot of them are pretty humble       ansel adams himself could descend from heaven to personally drill you on the camera the negative and the print and youd still have to take a shitload of bad pictures before you started getting good  i mean no not if he taught you well and culled bad habits like centering everything screwing up the exposure not being patient enough to wait for the right moment i know that a lot of people start out horrible and take a long time to get good but that just isnt the case for everyone    if you really think that practicing photography doesnt make a difference to the quality of photography you produce  blindly practicing with no aim or focus isnt going to enhance anything unless you really have no idea what you want to shoot or how you want to shoot it hell im not even sure what youre supposed to be practicing taking pictures pushing buttons
  you practice so you can be quick nail focus and exposure within a split second when a composition happens you practice so the camera is an extension of you rather than struggling with the settings you need if you dont you end up with missed focus snapshits like chosis    john free said it best practice practice practice  
  i can see that if youre shooting film and/or streetbut even then learning how to change a setting or raise the camera to your eye is not really something you practice because its pretty damn simple
  if its so simple people wouldnt be spraying and praying all the time or getting home and being surprised one of their shots turned out well because it was a literal accident the point is to take photos with intent and get it right every time exactly as you intended to with the correct depth of field and all other considerations locked on instantly which does take skill and experience thats when you become a consistent photographer and not someone who occasionally gets a keeper once a month
  john free  what a fucking snapshitter   only normies swallow his bullshit  fuck this made in china eugene smith it dont someone to tell me the basic photography theory shit which i all ready know
  hell im not even sure what youre supposed to be practicing taking pictures pushing buttons  id bet a nickel youre not a very good photographer    photography things you get better at with practice  1 obviously the basics of using your camera knowing where your controls are by feel being able to change settings quickly on the fly focusing your stance knowing the limits of shutter speeds you personally can handhold knowing the shutter speeds you should use for different subjects etc  2 knowing what focal lengths look best for which subjects knowing when to use a different focal length for a different effect knowing when its better to stick with the glass thats already on your camera and get the shot rather than swapping to a different lens and potentially missing it  3 seeing good light knowing light that looks neat in real life but wont fit into your cameras dynamic range and how to compensate for that being on the lookout at all times for more interesting lighting  4 seeing good composition having part of your brain dedicated to always keeping an eye out for neat compositional elements that would make a good photo being able to discard lame compositions without trying them and go straight for the compositions that have potential seeing whats in the background of a shot and getting better at either using whats in the background or hiding it depending on whether it hurts or helps you  5 seeing good color or tones if youre shooting bw being able to spot colors out in the world that work well together and would make a good shot

  ctd  6 seeing good locations im mainly a portrait photographer and i always have an eye out for good shooting locations people are always asking me how i find such good spots to shoot and my response is basically i fucking look for them motherfucker what do you think just sheer repetition and practice means that ive gotten very good at spotting places that would make good locations any time im driving around  7 coming up with good ideas for photographs if youre the sort of photographer who plans out exactly the ideas they have you will legitimately get better at that creative aspect of it if you actually dedicate time to think up new ideas instead of just waiting for inspiration to randomly hit you you can literally practice creativity  8 uniqueness for lack of a better word thinking outside of the box for angles that other people might not go for or poses that most people wouldnt think to try etc you take enough photos and look at enough other peoples photos and you get a feel for what people including you do by default and that lets you do something different and different quite frequently leads to better photos    so taking a picture of a person you just put them in front of the camera lift it up hit the button youre thinking thats easy and nowadays the camera does all of the work for me so what the hell do i have to practice    now imagine if instead of that process above you took the person to a really cool location with some great compositional elements at just the right time of day for the light to be hitting them perfectly while not falling so far outside of your cameras dynamic range that your highlights or shadows get clipped to hell much better picture and all of that is stuff you can learn but you only really internalize it and get good at it through practice
    ctd  and photography is something where there are rabbit holes of further study all over the place like you can be the worlds best shooter with a 50mm lens and still fall down when trying to shoot a 28mm if you dont do it a lot because you dont have the experience to know how to compose well with the wider focal length or you might be an amazing portrait photographer but not know how to shoot a stage performance or be great at stage performances but suck at product photography or whatever all of these things you just get better at with practice    and obviously no im not just saying just shoot whatever and dont even think about it thats a strawman argument im saying that you actually have to understand what youre doing and what youre trying to get better at but you still need to do it to get better at it dont put it in burst mode and tape your finger to the shutter button but actually look through the viewfinder and look at compositions and try things out and see what works and what doesnt if you want to get better at portrait photography you cant just read a book and assume you know everything about it you have to actually set up photoshoots and take actual pictures of people i look at my old shoots and even if they werent bad my more recent ones are much better and im sure the shoots i do in the future will be even better than what im doing now every shoot i do i get a little bit better at posing composing working with my location etc every shoot i do i get a little more experience planning things out thinking of good shots getting the shots i want etc    practice makes you get better with basically every human skill if you really dont think so you have not practiced nearly enough

  if its so simple    it is but people are lazy/dont want to put in a lot of effort they talk themselves put of buying a 300 camera because they cant justify it then turn around and spend 1000 on a phone because thats easy and familiar     a keeper once a month   since you referenced a adams earlier im sure youre familiar with his expression that 12 photographs of any significance in a year is a good crop
  the basics  lmao you dont practice learning how to push buttons or turn dials    knowing what focal lengths   you dont practice focal lengths like that you adjust yourself and angle of view based on what you see in the viewfinder and your desired composition every situation is different     seeing good light  aka stop shooting in the middle of the day or with awful backlight again i dont see what youre practicing here do you also practice not dropping your camera i can see getting used to studio lights and modifiers though     composition   this might be the only thing that requires practice    good colors   i think this is more of an instinct thing     locations   its called scouting you dont really practice that you just do it    good ideas  uniqueness  again i dont see how you practice these practice is something you do to hone a specific motor skill that requires consistent refinement you practice shooting hoops or throwing a football or catching a baseball you dont practice seeing light or color you learn it by reading or being educated by another after that its always with you
   since you referenced a adams earlier  that was actually me im a different guy than the one youre responding to youre arguing with two separate people    im sure youre familiar with his expression that 12 photographs of any significance in a year is a good crop  i am and youre misunderstanding it    when adams refers to a photograph of any significance there hes talking about a photograph of any significance by the standards of ansel fucking adams ie this is a photograph that will be significant in the history of photography it is different from what the guy youre replying to means when he says a keeper ie he means more a photo worth showing other people ansel means a photo worth hanging in an art museum in a retrospective of the life of one of historys most celebrated landscape photographers    further he wasnt saying just take twelve shots in a month thats fine photography is easy what hes saying is that if after going out at the asscrack of dawn and practicing your art until the final rays of golden hour sunset nearly every day for a full year your end result after culling all but the very best of the best is 12 photos youre doing well or rather he was saying that hes doing well in that scenario he certainly wasnt encouraging beginning or intermediate photographers to take fewer photographs its more a quote about being ruthless in the curation of your own work than it is a quote about how much photography you should do and its definitely not a quote saying you shouldnt practice if you want to be a better photographer
  not him but this is the most gearfag and retarded opinion   my homo when youre doing street photography you have to gain street confidence which come from practicing   if your are only staring one subject and not giving attention to whole background then you are missing the bigger picture  when i started taking photos this was the major factor why my photos sucked because i ignored my background  by practicing now my vision is much greater and i can notices much more things in a scene     again practice is everything is nigger
  taking a photo worth showing other people doesnt really mean much at all for many people as long as it has a sunset a cat the beach or mountains its a good photo    ansel adams isnt the only one with high standards for himself and some people choose not to show just any old photo for no reason other than other people would like it
  right so what youre saying is you took snapshots you didnt like until you or someone else pointed out weaknesses or flaws in them again i dont think its about practice as much as its about culling bad habits that weaken your shots you dont practice not shooting too tight you just dont do it unless you want to do it because sometimes its fine to exclude the background and not every image needs to be cut from the same cloth    gearfag opinion  what i didnt say anything about gear
  lmao you dont practice learning how to push buttons or turn dials  you literally do dude or i mean good photographers literally do one does if one wishes to become good at using ones camera    you dont practice focal lengths like that you adjust yourself and angle of view based on what you see in the viewfinder and your desired composition every situation is different   heres another example of you showing yourself to be an inexperienced photographer not every situation is different if you find yourself having to cycle from ultrawide to supertele with every shot to find the one that works youre wasting a heck of a lot of time with practice youll learn what lens gives you the perspective and field of view that you want for the composition youre going for     again i dont see what youre practicing here  that is painfully obvious    there is so much more to the world of photographic natural lighting than dont shoot in the middle of the day or with awful backlight    i think color is more of an instinct thing  you think that because you havent practiced it if you did youd discover you can get better at it     you dont really practice scouting you just do it  just doing it is another word for practicing the more you just do it the better you get at knowing what locations will actually be good for photos and what locations look cool but arent actually that great for photos and the better you get at knowing where to look for good locations     again i dont see how you practice coming up with good unique creative ideas  the same way you practice anything by doing it over and over again the more you do it the better you get at it     try this dick around for a month just hoping that inspiration hits you see how many good ideas you come up with     then spend a month making a conscious effort to come up with a new original idea for a photo every day see which works better
  again practice is everything is nigger  read carefully 
  you know what he means consistency means youre improving as a photographer if youre taking hundreds of photos in a day and maybe finding one or two you like that you took by accident and not with any composition in mind if youre honest with yourself then youre not a good photographer because you cant repeat it no one would hire you to be a photojournalist or to cover sports youre inconsistent and sloppy    thats why photographers who get magnum scholarships need to keep putting out published work often and at a consistently high quality they need to show theyre still great and still do the work to fill multiple books sometimes one a year for some prolific photographers means youre consistently good that takes practice to become that good

  inexperienced   nah you wish it would be convenient that someone who disagrees with you is inexperienced but thats just not true    you havent practiced it  lol    the composition youre going for  what youre originally planning isnt always the best option sometimes it is but sometimes youre so determined to get this one image from this one angle because you think its the best thing possible until you either turn around or take a step back and notice something you didnt before     you dont practice color you read up on color theory and you observe your surroundings until you get good color harmony you dont practice light you just look at a scene and figure out for yourself if its to your liking you might argue doing that is practicing but i really dont think it is      maybe type proper english and not that mess you just made       no one would hire you to shoot sports etc  youre giving magazines and news outlets way too much credit a lot of them just have the press use iphones or publish user submitted phone images often terrible snapshots inb4 they should just practice using their phone lol thats not it at all people just dont put in effort because they dont take photography seriously and just snap pics of things they like leaving it at that    magnum  kinda overrated a lot of good stuff but some of it is just pretentious holier than thou yeah there is a quality standard overall but imo forcing people to generate output is not always beneficial to creativity or quality

  you seem to be arguing that being good at photography is some innate thing that youre born with the skill and instincts to be a great photographer which is a nice dream i guess but it has no basis in reality like most skills in the world you need to go out and crunch through years of work and yes practice to become any good at photography like anything else    its nice to think that some people are just born savants but when you look at the work of most famous photographers they have full rooms in their houses dedicated to binders and drawers of prints  negatives all practice and year of graft
  nah you wish it would be convenient that someone who disagrees with you is inexperienced but thats just not true  okay how much experience do you have because it really sounds like not a lot just as an example going back to i assume your previous post     aka stop shooting in the middle of the day   with experience youll learn yes that shooting in harsh midday sun is usually awful but  1 it only really applies to shooting certain types of subjects like people or landscapes  2 it doesnt actually apply to those subjects as a hard and fast rule eg you can totally shoot people at noon you just have to find a spot where they arent getting hard noontime shadows under their eyes some examples of solutions shooting under a tree shooting under an awning sunglasses shooting them laying down  3 it doesnt apply to people at all on overcast days since clouds make the sky into a gigantic perfect softbox although you then want to frame your shot such that you dont have the blank boring white sky in the shot  4 the harsh shadows can also be used creatively    or with awful backlight  and again  1 silhouettes are taken with backlight and can be very good photos  2 you can also use a backlight as a rimlight for a cool effect  3 or you can have it peek out from behind your subject a bit for some creative lens flare  4 but you have to know your camera well enough that you can focus with a backlight to make those work     and you get better at all of those withsay it with me nowpractice
  and before you say hurr anybody can be good just press the shutter i mean good enough to have an identifiable unique style at a glance and a large body of work that is important and valuable to achieve that takes years of trying and failing and experimenting and practice
  haallo mr shugour eye think itz ay confeosion   eye em nat tawking too u
  dont shoot awful backlight  what part of awful didnt you understand i really didnt think i needed to differentiate between awful backlight and a pleasing silhouette     you have to know your camera well enough  lol what    experience   about seven years     not a hard and fast rule   nothing is but the majority of the time mid day light is not good and should only be shot in if youre covering something urgent and time sensitive      an innate thing  no thats not what i said i said practicing by learning button placements camera settings or how the light looks is not doing you the favors you think it is i also dont think taking a decent photo is hard but people are just lazy about it and nobody is challenging them to do better taking a great photograph yeah thats hard like most things especially if you want something unique and non derivative but taking a photo that is at least correctly exposed and at least passes compositionally no not really that hard
   what part of awful didnt you understand  the part where you think theres some difference between different kinds of light that makes one type awful as backlighting and another type good its not about the light its about how you use the light the only difference between good backlighting and awful backlighting is the skill of the photographer which once again is a factor of experience    about seven years  this is a meaningless answer do you mean you read a book about photography seven years ago but dont actually own a camera or do you mean youve been going out and taking a picture every single day for seven years    if youve actually been taking pictures consistently for seven years do you truly not think youve gotten any better during that time

  not hating but pretty sure the nazis had huge faggots back then the self proclaimed nazis today are trannies dont know anything about national socialism and use tumblr
  i didnt say i didnt get better i said that practicing with no aim or purpose is fruitless if i go out to shoot i intend to get a keeper i dont have in mind that im going to practice something arbitrary like learning button placement or exposure    the part where you think theres some difference  because there is an experienced photog is not going to shoot with the sun behind everything turning the subject and foreground into black blobs the best rule of thumb is if it looks like crap to the naked eye itll look like crap in a picture
  i manually colour grade  using luts  yeah these two cancel eachother out
i sometimes put instagram filters over my pics before posting them
   if i go out to shoot i intend to get a keeper  im sorry did you think this whole time when we said you should practice photography to get better at photography that we meant physically just practice finding the buttons over and over again while not paying attention to whats in the viewfinder is that the disconnect this whole time    no we mean go out try to get keepers the more you do it the better you will get at it thats all we mean by practicing photography
i live in israel
  ah reminds me of the guy from /sp/ except he shot college sports
  i have no idea how to mess with curves and only have a vague idea of what they even do
  not the same anon but i guess it was on yourshot
  ive started to make my pictures slightly desaturated and more moody and my followers have been steadily rising ever since
  did you think that we meant   some guy above said you should practice learning button placement among other things so yeah i actually did    this whole thing started because i balked at the idea that you need to be shooting a whole fuck ton to get food at photography usually the narrative around here is you should shoot film because you think about shots more and get better quicker but ultimately shoot less thats kind of why i say to seek feedback and actually think about shots not just blindly practice and thats probably why this argument started
  i am moop and i am a better photographer than all yall
  moop  who
  sonyshill who never posted any photos except one of a trash can also lies constantly about retarded things and then keeps moving goalposts when confronted
  using film as a means to think more and take better shots individually doesnt mean you restrict yourself to one roll a month or fewer daido moriyama taught his students you should go through as many rolls of film you can each month upwards of 50 if possible you can still take a lot of shots while valuing each one in a roll with digital now theres no excuse to not hit that mark    i cant believe theres some argument on /p/ to do less work and not actually use your camera as much as you can it doesnt make you a better photographer to sit on your hands and shitpost on here more than shooting
  he posted this the other day clearly not a bin clearly better than anything youve posted
  hand cut off  sure thing bud
  some guy above said you should practice learning button placement among other things so yeah i actually did  no i said   knowing where your controls are by feel  as in training your muscle memory so that you use those controls without having to even consciously think about it and i meant with that whole long post that those are things youll get better at the more often you go out and try to take good pictures not that you should go out and individually focus on individual items from that list each day or whatever     i balked at the idea that you need to be shooting a whole fuck ton to get good at photography  okay i thought it might just be a misunderstanding but apparently youre doubling down on it     yes you need to shoot a whole fuck ton to get good at photography that is how you gain experience as a photographer you even used the phrase an experienced photog in one of your posts what exactly the hell do you think experience is other than you know doing the thing     seek feedback and actually think about shots not just blindly practice  i cannot fathom why you think these two ideas are mutually exclusive practice just means do the thing you want to get better at more i never said you shouldnt think about the shots youre taking in fact my implication was that thinking about the shots youre taking is one of the things that you get better at the more you do it which means you know you have to do it     the more you do photography the better at photography you get i am still shocked that there are people on this board that find this a controversial assertion     usually the narrative around here is you should shoot film because you think about shots more and get better quicker but ultimately shoot less  yeah i argue with those people too thats just a way for them to justify letting their gear collect dust on a shelf while simultaneously feeling superior to most photographers
  sonyshill who never posted any photos  back when i was hanging out in the discord that he and isi were on he said he hadnt actually taken any pictures in years he just likes being an ass
  wouldnt the alternative be cutting at the knee which is a definite no no
  thats funny i was on the sane discord and he posted more photos than anyone else
  cutting hands off is a definite no
  at the wrist i agree half way down the hand is ok    honestly your criticism just highlights how little portrait work you have done look at this beautiful diagram and try to apply it to the original photo if you have people of different heights youre going to have to compromise on your cuts
  it doesnt make you a better photographer   neither does shooting without intent    shoot a ton of film  the argument is usually something like learn to think about your shots more because they cost money which implies limiting how much you take       shooting a fuckton  what does this even mean to me it sounds like firing off rapidly until you get something you like im all for practicing if youre actually learning and growing with each shot im not gonna tell people to just shoot a lot because if youre getting good teaching or feedback and youre looking at your stuff objectively it shouldnt really take a fuckton of photos to start seeing good light or composition or consistently expose well
  shooting without intent  why do you keep arguing with this straw man whos saying you should shoot without intent    the other prophotography people in this thread and i are not saying to shoot randomly and without intent were saying to go out and try to take good pictures more frequently and youll take good pictures more frequently     which implies limiting how much you take  limiting how much you shoot is a side effect of shooting film you should work against not a goal ideal is that you should consider your composition and subject and such more but then also go though that process of thinking about what youre going to shoot and then shooting just as much     its like if you noted that exercise makes you sweat and so decided that smelling bad and having stains all over your clothing is the reason you should exercise     to me it sounds like  why the everloving fuck does it sound like that to you when ive been telling you over and over again that shooting without paying attention to what youre doing is not what im saying    let me clarify think of the steps that you go through to take a good picture the process you go through whenever you personally shoot which presumably you think results in getting good pictures     we are saying do that more if you want to become a better photographer who does that same process less frequently     theres not some material difference between the process of taking a photograph that were advocating and the process you are were just saying do it more doing it more in no way implies that we are advocating doing it worse dont just fire off more frames in the same amount of time and with the same total effort put in the same amount of pershot effort and therefore spend more time taking more photographs
  we are saying do that more if you want to become a better photographer  than one  who does that same process less frequently  trying to multitask and missed a couple of important words
  youre saying to practice by shooting a lot because it makes you better im arguing it does not theres people who have been shooting a lot for decades and take poor to mediocre photos at best theres others who have been doing it for a year or two and have already been given gallery showings and sold prints usually the difference is that the former didnt really study visual art or bother with the basic principles unlike the latter to put it another way if shooting a lot by itself made you better then all the people who have shot tens of thousands of pictures on their smartphones would be really goodbut many arent and they readily admit it
  i also in no way said shooting a lot is all you need to do so thats another straw man youre arguing with
i started to lurk here to have a common topic with a hot hipster girl i ended up liking it buying a film camera and i dont even hang out with her anymore

this board has one of the worse photography aesthetic i ever saw    im just here for the gearfagging and banter     reddit is way better
  i honestly hate people like you yes the banter is good but theres more to it than that across all boards honestly looking at reddit the lack of self awareness and the god awful hugbox nature is reflected in the work they produce
  this
  telll us the story  who /p/ fetish here
  he basically went around to volleyball games with a clipboard with a few random papers once in a while hed flip a few pages and pretend to write something down about the players he kept his eyes on it was the perfect ruse because naturally people who saw him at the games assumed he was a pro athlete scout when asked which organization he represented he simply told them he wasnt allowed to say he kept it up for months and no one bat an eye
  but theres more to it than that across all boards  like what exactly  inb4 valuable cc    ps im not him and i dont give a fuck the rest of 4chan i only look at /p/
i only take pictures with my phone
  i thought women loved canon and not pentax
  thats a straw man youre arguing    lol no youre the one vehemently clinging to this notion that you must shoot a lot to get good im saying no you dont
i refuse to use canon products because in high school i broke one and got scolded really hard for it and now i get ww2 flashbacks every time i see the canon logo
  weighing in    simplistically youre right especially when time isnt of the essence if youre smart enough and cultured enough then the whole compositional side of things should not require any practice or training but the minute you get into situations that require speed or technique beyond setting a tripod up youre going to need a lot of technical experience and muscle memory to get the shot intentionally barring the odd fluke everyone who excels in any field does so through relentless practice
  simplistically youre right especially when time isnt of the essence  no even then     like consider sculpture i know what a horse looks like i know how to use a tiny hammer given enough time and a big block of granite could i sculpt a statue of a horse fuck no because theres a difference between knowing how to do it on an intellectual level and actually knowing how to do it the latter comes with experience youve got to sculpt a lot of shitty representations of horses to get to the point where you can make a decent one    same thing with photography i cant tell you the number of times ive seen a photo and wanted to recreate some aspect of it and so tried and failed over and over again i see people posting how do i achieve this look threads here all the time these are situations where you have an actual picture of the thing you want to take a similar picture to right in front of you plus instructions how to do it but you still need to go out and do it and usually fuck up a few times before you really get the technique    another example i occasionally shoot juggling festivals people ask me if i know how to juggle to which i reply yesive read all about it and watched it a lot and taken pictures of jugglers juggling and am well versed in the techniques    but can i juggle nope not even a little bit that part takes practice and i dont care enough to spend the time on it just knowing how is not enough
  lol no youre the one vehemently clinging to this notion that you must shoot a lot to get good im saying no you dont  a strawman argument is an argument where you argue with an indefensible version of your opponents argument instead of the actual argument hes making     the argument i am making is yes that you must shoot a lot to get good the strawman version of it that youre arguing against is that the only thing you need to do to become a good photographer is randomly fire off more frames     i am not saying that just taking more pictures is the only thing you have to do you also need to look at good pictures you also need to read up on technique you also need to go through the pictures you take to determine what works and what doesnt etc just taking more pictures is not enough which is why thats not my argument     however it is required its a skill and literally every skill gets better when you practice it in the entire skill of human existence     if you are seriously arguing against that it means that either    a you have been doing photography enough that youre able to see a change in your skill level over time or   b your photos really havent gotten better over time the photos you took when you first got your first camera are exactly as good as the photos you take after having it for years regardless of how much you shoot your photos just never get any better    there is no other option and neither of those look good for you    hell you tacitly agreed to my point yourself in  i posited that theres not a difference between good backlighting and bad backlighting and you said   an experienced photog is not going to shoot with the sun behind everything  what precisely the fuck do you think the phrase an experienced photographer means how exactly the fuck do you think one gains experience
  i went out for the first time ever to shoot photos uploaded them to my new flickr account and after a few hours a bot liked them    feels good man
i know i will never go anywhere with my photography
  vivian meier never went anywhere with her photography and now shes posthumously famous
  says the incel
  i know i will never go anywhere with my photography  of course you wont nobody here will so what its fun doing it anyway
i dont know what makes a photograph objectively good some photos i originally felt nothing for get lauded with praise and others that i love seem to get pretty neutral or negative feedback     i dont know why it matters except for that part of me that wants to be consistent in quality and not feel like the images i take that a lot of others love are some special chance i swear all my images are from me only yet even on /p/ someone once asked if all the photographs in my thread were from the same person dunno maybe im overthinking it
  you can argue till youre blue in the fucking face but i still dont agree with you i dont think you need to shoot a lot to be good thats not getting into what our definitions of a lot are     i am not saying that just taking more pictures is the only thing you have to do you also need to look at good pictures you also need to read up on technique you also need to go through the pictures you take to determine what works and what doesnt etc just taking more pictures is not enough which is why thats not my argument   if youre doing the latter you need far less of the former i think youre vastly overestimating the impact that practicing has over somebodys photographic output im saying this as someone who got compared to stephen shore after only having photographed seriously for two years      like im not trying to offend anyone by saying that their time spent photographing isnt valuable actually this all started cause i was thinking oddly of the word practice to begin with to put it this way that word to me implies youll get another chance that youll be able to go back and recreate a scenario exactly as it was that theres less at stake ie your favorite professional sports team goes out to practice during the offseason coming off the heels of a championship win but if youre out in the field which could mean anything ranging from shooting during the best sunset youve seen in a month to shooting at the olympics youre playing for keeps because chances are a lot of those situations wont recreate themselves again so i would hope someone is trying their damnedest to make the most of every situation regardless of experience level and not being stuck in their head trying to practice learning how to turn the camera on and use it
  i just won an award actually
    honestly this whole idea that you need to practice sounds like some gatekeeping argument sure anyone can refine experiment with and change up their craft endlessly until death but that doesnt necessarily mean they werent good early on or that theyre practicing vs experimenting or simply growing every time they pick up a camera you sound like you judge people on how many photos theyve taken or would quickly tell someone to shoot more without telling them why
    you sound like a filmfag
piss off spammer
  you sound like you judge people on how many photos theyve taken or would quickly tell someone to shoot more without telling them why  i mean i certainly judge people who come here and bitch about the minutia of image quality while their actual camera collects dust on a shelf if someone does occasionally go out and take photos though i certainly wont judge them unless theyre arguing that its a virtue to take fewer photos     so i mean yeah im gatekeeping in that im saying that if you want to call yourself a photographer you need to occasionally take photos that does not seem like a particularly controversial gate to keep    im definitely not the sort of person wholl give criticism like youre terrible you need to shoot more if thats what youre saying     or would quickly tell someone to shoot more without telling them why  ive written walls and walls of text in this thread on the subject of why you should shoot more so that seems like a really odd criticism        so i would hope someone is trying their damnedest to make the most of every situation regardless of experience level and not being stuck in their head trying to practice learning how to turn the camera on and use it  this is that strawman again where you think that i mean practice as something distinct from going out and trying to make the most of every photographic opportunity if theres a better word for this than practice that will bunch your panties less please let me know    if youre out in the field taking photos youre practicing thats what the word means in this context here look at the dictionary definition    practice /ˈpraktəs/  noun  repeated exercise in or performance of an activity or skill so as to acquire or maintain proficiency in it
i use nikon and i like it
when no ones looking i like to stare at the sun dont judge me
  same but i dont keep it a secret
      yes im very successful if you want tips on how to do this it usually helps to not be hideous if youre ugly/fat then make up for it by not being an autistic idiot be comfortable around people and make people feel safe its when you provide them with that safe environment that girls lower their guard and let you do just about anything to them do regular shoots out on the con floor but hand over your business card yes get a card dont be stupid and give your number because its a giveaway that youre trolling for trim and mention that youll be at the show the whole time you cut your session short so they get a taste of what you can do show them the shots youve taken but again these are morons so i recommend shooting in jpg or better yet some bullshit incamera picture profile to make it look like youre some sort of photo wizard    this really only works with inexperienced nerd chicks you find at cons professional cosplayers chicks that come to cons with a photog entourage have already played this game and are their own pimp dont get greedy when this works if youre at a multiday con and fucked a bitch the first day dont go out and find someone the second day word travels fast with social media and youll blow your job opportunities but most importantly your potential to fuck any other lonely bitches     i started doing this years ago when i first went to anime conventions looking for a quick buck but seeing how eager to please these girls are raised my senses and have been doing this ever since i do a lot of regional cons and fly out for the bigger ones in ca and ny but the most exciting one for me is always comiket its always a challenge but fucking that one girl dressed as some mobile game slut while promising ill tag her in photos on instagram always makes me feel like a porn producer
    truly the sodomy of photography
  show us some pics mate
  can you post any of the girls  the body only of course
  i think you are conflating good photos and consistent style    to address your first question theres two parts to this answer a photographer needs to be able to both execute technically in a photograph but also tell a story/express some emotion/otherwise give the viewer a reason to engage with the image this can exist entirely in the image on its own or it can be an accompanying article/blurb that gives context for an image a photograph does not need to be technically perfect but if it isnt there should be some emotional aspect that explains/ties into the technical failing a grainy blurry image of a protest movement makes sense thematically a blurry portrait for a photoseries on lawyers less so    consistency in style is something that many photographers end up with but that isnt the end all be all of being a successful photographer as long as the inconsistency is recognized you can take a variety of good images that all look wildly different    that said if youre looking to make a career out of photography people like to see consistency of style so they know what theyre getting when they hire you consistency also leads to much better success on social media these things of course do not necessarily need to be a priority for you    i have an inconsistent overall style but a very consistent one within the same photoseries this works well for me but ymmv    if you want to post some pics or your instagram i might be able to address your first question and the criticism youre receiving more directly
    how dare they
ive got a leica m9p sitting in my drawer and i am not using it at all
  i will absolve you of this sin if i can have the m9p
  do you have any tips on what people are usually looking for in a good cosplay photograph id only really be doing hall shots because i dont think im good enough to charge for shoots what lens do you use 50mm
  im a poorfag student who cant be arsed to work more than a few hours a week since i enjoy living minimally and even i can afford this hobby   just start cooking at home if you cant get a balanced diet for under 3/day youre doing something horrendously wrong i mention food since its normally the easiest place to cut costs without cutting quality shit like rent is hard to reduce without reducing the quality of where you live or the like
      id have to crop a lot of the ones ive got i would love to post some of the japanese models but a lot of the girls ive shot ended up with promotion agencies and im scared shitless of losing those contracts ill check what i can find when im back home         again these are mostly inexperienced girls if they have an elaborate costume full body stuff then yeah get a good 50 or 35 for environmental portrait work if you have a second camera body then leave a zoom or second mid tele prime on it 85 to get that headshot capture you can get away with walking around with one camera but you look even more like a pro when you get that second camera out its stupid but you should see the look on these girls faces when you take out a big zoom lens they immediately feel like theyre a real model     i used to carry speedlites but its a huge pain in the ass to carry that shit on the floor so i just bring fast lenses and a reflector the level of dynamic range on these new cameras is incredible if you know the settings i used to shoot canon but switched to sony a few years back for the lighter weight and because getting in on the ground floor with them helped me get a lot of lenses for free via ambassador work i keep my 55mm/18 on my a7iii and my 70200/28 on my a7riii i have the 85mm/14gm but only use that when im actually hired by some of these people for professional studio work     if you want to see what people like just go online or especially go to instagram and check the cosplay hashtags or search this one on there for the japanese ones コスプレ
  sounds like a total bro using your photos instead of the pro ones
  i think my nikon j4 is probably in that range
i always forget to resize my shit which stops me from phone posting while at work    i also exclusively posted here while i was starting out and the harsh truths/criticisms drove me to git gud just so i could please you faggots
  its stupid but you should see the look on these girls faces when you take out a big zoom lens    girls love a large phallic object shoved in their face    you dont say    id love to see those pics senpai cropped or not  why do you want to to show the japanese in particular  what others do you have
  why do you want to to show the japanese in particular    theyre prettier/sexier i only have those kinds of photos when it comes to cosplay models im in seoul until thanksgiving for now so i dont have access to my photos until at least then
  theyre prettier/sexier    than what koreans
  i only shoot cheap chinese film on a unpopular camera that has dirty lenses 90 of my stuff is over or underexposed or overall fucked up im still happy tho cuz i got to talk to girls and take pictures of them
  thats the dream
  post pics
  how
  are you me
  anywhere i can read the original post super interested in this
  i havent read yotsuba yet
  congratulations youre a part of the 999 of people who hasnt on 4chan
  ive never used a camera to take a picture in my entire life and ive only recently started using my phone to take some less than decent images
  i dont have any friends
got into photography partially because i thought it would help me with being retarded in social situations   im now pretty competent when shooting models seem to like me and feel comfortable around me  have been invited out to eat drink oe chill multiple times but i end up turning them down or ignoring dms if they keep dming me because being socially competent while shooting doesnt seem to translate over very well to a purely casual friendly nonshoot situation     welp so much for that
  ive found that it works well to bring my camera with me to situations like that so i can hide behind it when things get too awkward
i bought a howto book on erotic photography while in germany  i told myself it was to learn german  i still dont know german and im not interested in any of the models because theyre so vanilla
  whats a dm
  dick massager
  what do you mean by hiding behind your camera  does it give you a talking point or something    cameras are nice because you can still be shy as hell and people will respect you as long as you carry a huge/vintage looking camera  makes it easier for people to recognize you as an introvert but with a cool hobby infinitely better than to be recognized as an introvert nerd or just introverted by normalfaggots
    this is my gf for your fetish
  as in if theres an awkward silence or something i can take a picture of them instead of interacting like a normal human being
why is /p/ filled with so much social anxiety
i believe that cameras made outside germany and japan will magically fall apart while im shooting so i avoid them like the plague  though some people say they have problems with the offshored lenses and bodies not being good fitments w/e
  thanks brah
for a few years now i just never take any photos when im home only on vacation i cant get motivated to photograph anything around where i live then when im on vacation i feel rusty and my photos dont come out as well as they could if i wasnt so out of practice    i also have piles of undeveloped film and a whole darkroom setup at my parents house but i havent developed or printed anything in forever because i have no room to set it up in my apartment
  because /p/ is made up of humans living in 2018
  because were pussies
  desu the older kodaks are pretty good
  youre welcome and fuck i think i got this fetish too what do i google for shit like that
  flickr is good
  i wish kodak stopped memeing and built an actual camera since all these nips do is milk their fucking sensors through 6 generations
i have a film camera and i never used it i just edit my dslr shots on lightroom with vsco presets and post em on internet with film
i shill for  because i dont want to regret the purchases ive made    and my photographs arent that good
    because drumpf makes it literally illegal to exist these days no fucking shit were on edge
i more often feel need to photograph my camera than to photograph with my camera
  same happens to me these days
i suspect my coworker was gay    so i suck his dick to prove hes gay totally dude was a total homo

sometimes i wish there was a /p/ discord because having to deal with a captcha for simple questions/gripes/comments and sharing a photo or two would be much simpler
  not having yo deal with
  there is a /p/ discord im not sure if this is still the case but there were two of them at one point     i was on one of them for a while and then it occurred to me that i hate you people and real time communication didnt really improve that
should i make a girls with cameras thread before 4channel prevents me from doing so ever again
  yeah  i got some to post
  that could be a good shot if there wasnt so much fucking noise
  i dont take pictures and i spend my welfare money on camera gear
  i like m43 cameras as a thing i can shove into smaller pants pockets with ease
  apsc  no gold ring    pig disgusting
i wonder if i can get cosplay bitches with a compact camera
  fuck no girls want huge bodies and thick lenses
  fuck off
  garbage
  i bought a fuji x100f not because of photography i just use it as a fashion accessory helps me pick up girls
  is it the all black one
  bought the silver one kind of wish i went with black though
  on a similar note i used to shoot my minolta himatic 7 downtown on the weekends just as an icebreaker because it drew attention from girls  confession  more than half the time i wouldnt even load film
  minolta himatic 7  nice i live in portland so the girls here love the hipster vibe that these rangefinder style cameras bring
  minneapolis region here  this was back in 20132015ish  pretty much right up til the night met my current girlfriend    i also sometimes would take my black nikon fe but that usually had film in it and i have an sbe flash for it flash at 1/4/ power 1/125 f8 iso 800 film scale focus for 2m with gaffer tape to lock the focus ring down     i would just use it like a point and shoot
  sorry the sb20 not the sbe

mfw d90 and even thinking of anything low light   i need to fucking upgrade
  seriously what is it with gearfags d90 and d3200 are both fine as heck for todays standards of lowlight images to be shared online and printed
    exactly we are all just staring at our 5 inch cell screens with shitty compressed insta posts
  granted its been a while for me but uhhh in my experience with an old d80 anything over 640 might as well be shot on a game boy camera
  im on phone so yeah screw myself but anyway i took this pic with a d3200 and regular cheap ass zoom lenses they throw in for you  its barely a decent camera for todays standards but shooting manual and and getting comfy with it will eventually land you good enough pictures that will look better after processing them
  exposure time 1/500 sec  iso speed rating 4500  why
  i feel this so much in my heart my parents got me a d3k for my bday in like 8th grade because i seemed in to pee a decade and change later and its still all i have and any reason to shoot above 400 iso is a reason to give up and go home the sensor decomposition is speeding up every shot i take i really hate it the school library i rent from has really sold me on a t6i though itll probably be what i upgrade to cant afford school so rents them for me
  30 july 2009  oh i guess not a decade and change later then just feels like it
  why  retardation
  come on i have a d7100 which barely has better high iso performance and low light handheld is fine  get yourself a f28 and learn how to hold your fucking camera
  what would be holding camera well 1/50 shutter
  ebic post upboated
be me  upgrade every new camera    jk i have no camera
  if youve got a steady hand you can get away with 1/30th
yeah i did that with my 5d2  but then i moved to a 5d4 and its not like ive been taking better photos but i can just worry less and take the photos i want    and well ive actually been taking better photos in some situations like i can actually take portraits with people moving because my fucking af actually tracks them
    shake is directly linked to focal lenght  1/50 on a 24mm lens is more than safe on a 135mm lens its not even close
  1/81/2070mm with vr on depending on wind and how tired you are just make sure to take 5 photos and one of them will be good  stabilization is a fucking godsend for handheld low light whether you like it or not

tempted to make a thread about camera stances for 1/20 shooting  i like having a tight strap under my arm so i can put 4 points of contact on my camera instead of 3 or the dreaded 2 but even when you have negated the shakiness of your hands and top you still your legs to worry about which are the worst kneeling sitting and leaning towards something really helps
  grasp the camera with both hands press the viewfinder to your face and hold your breath    that is fine for up to 1/10 for me and i dont have particularly steady hands
  thats exactly what i do but i use my strap as extra support

  proud boys
  i cant imagine being this retard but have fun tring  if you cant make art with what you have dont bother upgrading
  how can you tell
  how is this picture any good this is asian tourist snapshot with smartphone tier wtf
  if it isnt doing what you want it to do or is a pain to use then go ahead and upgrade those really are the only considerations that should go into upgrading or buying any new camera equipment      theyre fine up to a point the d90 has an older sensor with low resolution and the d3200 has an older sensor with 24 mp which doesnt make for the best low light performance compared to others the main issues with the d3200 are that   you have to menu dive to change a lot of settings  the viewfinder and overall body are smaller  the af is not very fast and struggles in low light  build quality is not that great it can break easier or also let in water much easier than higher end bodies  old lenses cant af on this body and because of the tiny viewfinder and lack of dof preview button it would be way too much of a pain to manually focus on this thing    the above are less of issues on the d90 but that thing is a fucking dinosaur yeah you can get good shots on it i wont say otherwise but i wouldnt criticize anyone who wants something newer as well     if you want a real upgrade id look at something like a d7200 or canon 70d a t3i is basically the same thing you have now with a flip out screen also consider lenses mainly primes like the 35 18 dx 50 18g or 85 18g since theyre not too expensive and deliver very high image quality and you can carry them forward to other bodies unless you go fx the 35 18 dx would have cropped corners on an fx body
  the 35mm f/18g dx can be used on fx in a pinch if you dont focus too close and close the apeture a bit theres no vignetting
  it vignetted at all apertures when i tried it and it was a fully noticeable black area outside the image circle with no information
  because thats the dude that started it and black and gold is their colors
  the main weakness of the a7m2 is its battery i use the viewfinder only to reduce the drain my experience is biased with it as i shoot with my canon 6dmodern lenses and put only vintage lenses on the sony short story is that it gives a realtime preview of the picture in sharpness dof and exposure shooting in manual focus is a lot of fun and everyone around me dig the sooc bw plus onsensor stabilization  i would recommend the d750 otherwise or the a7 markiii    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce7m2camera softwareadobe photoshop lightroom 614 windowsphotographerdavid mornetmaximum lens aperturef/10imagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage created20181128 204825exposure time1/40 secexposure programmanualiso speed rating1600brightness54 evexposure bias0 evmetering modecenter weighted averagelight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsorycolor space informationsrgbrenderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrasthardsaturationnormalsharpnesshard

  this is fucking terrible advice  a d7200 is no iq upgrade whatsoever over a d3200 its just literally double the weight  a t3i is a massive backwards step to an entirely obsolete generation of sensor  a sony a7 pic related can be had brand new with a lens and a warranty for under a grand or secondhand for probably under 500 ameribux and then you can mount literally any lens you can find in a bin or cupboard or opshop and get absolutely world class low light performance and you dont even need ibis if youre not a trembling little autist again pic related    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce7camera softwaregimp 2814maximum lens aperturef/10focal length 35mm equiv0 mmimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20181129 085619exposure time1/10 secfnumberf/00exposure programmanualiso speed rating1000brightness59 evexposure bias0 evmetering modecenter weighted averagelight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length000 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width1080image height1620renderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnesssoft
  fucking terrible advice  look at something like product    reading comprehension is not your thing i see or you just want to be argumentative because you are clearly some kind of sony shill i also disagreed with getting a t3i     no iq upgrade whatsoever  it has better performance and usability across the board relating to all the points i listed again try reading an entire post before you respond to it im not sure what your photograph is supposed to suggest its a picture of a fucking sign that basically any camera could take
  the big jump in low light performance comes with a jump to ff within a format the sensors are generally within 1ev of each other    modern apsc sensors are pretty good to 3200 but i have to admit ff is pretty good to 12800 and fucking awesome at 1600 and 3200
  a sony a7  fun fact the sony a7 has a fucking terrible sensor for a full frame camera with as much or more noise than an apsc camera of similar generation at least to my eyes the d7200 looks better at high iso it is so very very not absolutely world class low light performance    fun fact 2 the a7 mark ii has the same sensor and so similar noise levels    fun fact 3 you dont seem to understand that there is more to a camera than raw sensor performance the handling of a midrange body like a d7200 makes it very much an upgrade from an entrylevel body like the d3200
  a t3i is a massive backwards step to an entirely obsolete generation of sensor  muh fucking dxo memes  canons 18mp sensor was pretty good the later variants were solid to iso 3200 and could make clean sharp 20x30 prints from iso 100800 all day long that said youre better off going with the 24mp sensor in canons apsc line its even cleaner at 3200 and less shadow noise muh duhnamik range    but again the big jump comes when going to ff any ff look at features and lens libraries and get the ff you can afford
  holy shit i stand corrected when i say any ff i had no idea the a7 performed so poorly
    a t3i is a massive backwards step to an entirely obsolete generation of sensor  of course all of thats moot since the guy youre responding to was specifically saying that the t3i isnt really an upgrade over the d3200
  he doesnt know about the d7xxxs being fucking awesome   sony shill is used to a terrible button and interface experience so the d3xxxs are on par   t former d3300 owner who spent more time in the menu fucking around than actually shooting

  high iso is aesthetic  underexposed is a e s t h e t i c  lowlight performance is a meme  the one you have with you
  how can you not
  f/8 is the sweet spot for the tammy  yeah i get that but a fast shutter speed with a fast iso when nothing is moving    you could have captured the same shot with the base iso if you had stood still 3 or 4 shots not a low light shot    that being said for a snapshit it worked for me though 1/30sec for wangle and 100 iso would work if i had an iso invarient camera    i still think youre sweet sugar
  i started on a d60 and you could get this shot with a fast prime because the light source is right there next to the subject
  the point of that specific image is to show high iso performance
  have a bunch of old nikkortakumar and zeiss glass that i want to try out but my current mft sensor fucks with the cropfactor so bad   ive thought about the d750 but ive heard some mixed stories on the video isnt it getting outdated   the 7miii is way out of price range for me rn id prefer the nikon z6 also maybe it would save me the hassle of getting into a new system again
  1/10 of a second   not everyone is trying to walk around with a tripod all the time to take pictures  pls refer to the post    and you dont even need ibis if youre not a trembling little autist again pic related    it was handheld you cuck
  i know that feel   i upgraded from d5100 to d7200  i dont plan on investing on a fullframe yet maybe next year i will get the d700/d800
  63  1/10  iso less than 800  low light  what the fuck is wrong with this world
  shut up fag
  d7200 better than a7  what dark magic is this
  this a person is peakcalm at the end of exhale
  my guess is that running the sensor full time in live view or possibly just the optimizations they had to make to make it able to do that without catching fire add a lot of noise and they knew that most people would just think fuck yeah full frame and not look much closer at the actual image quality     also dxomark lists its lowlight iso score as on par with other full frame cams and significantly higher than the d7200 which made me stop trusting dxomark im not sure if their score methodology is just trash or if sony figured out how to game the system
i dont think ive ever taken a decent picture in lowlight with my d3200 honestly
              its ok to be gay and if they want to have a pride meetup thats fine by me and it should be fine by you too
  fellow d90 here  wont upgrade untill it dies
  muh street snaps at night  the less we see of that cliche shit the better
  photos shot during half of the day/night cycle is cliche    lol
  you should have owned a d40
  d90 bros unite
ever shooting with anything other than a diy pinhole camera  gearfags all need to be fucking gassed
  wtf is that bass
  what
  doesnt know bass  but then again its 2018 fuck time passes quickly
  i agree i have a d3000 and a d80 and both are horrible above 640 800 iso is terrible and 1600 is death
  will lenses really make a difference i get that better glass will help but if you have an old out dated image sensor good glass wont do much will it
  theyre kind of two axes along a plane of image quality     so yes putting good glass in front of a shitty outdated sensor wont give you good resultsbut sensors have been extremely good for a while now you have to go really far back into the depths of outdated before you get to the truly bad ones something like an early 2010s or late 2000s entrylevel body is still capable of creating great pictures and in a lot of cases wont actually be distinguishable from the latest and greatest in a blind taste test     but at the same time if you have the latest and greatest full frame sensor and you put a cheap earlymodel kit lens in front of it youre also not going to be getting a lot of value for your dollar and lens quality is more visible in a lot of situations since it can affect the picture at a macro level vs a better sensor which is often only noticeable viewed at 100     so the real lesson here is that anyone who says always do x is always an idiot and their opinion should be discarded always
  what the fuck so there is noise live with it
  dxomark is just trash their only saving grace is that their dr scores are internally consistent though that doesnt mean they match what you would get photographing a step wedge they tend to understand actual dr    everything else about dxo is inconsistent and meaningless trash

  i crunched the numbers before and its not worth it at least not right now where theres no memorable family/friends stuff to film  60 for a camera worth less than 20  40 for 3 minutes worth of film  another 30 to develop it  have to track down and buy a film projector    also when i was looking at the film few months ago i only saw color and bh negatives the kodak site says they still sell color positive but its back ordered
  the kodak site says they still sell color positive but its back ordered  thats the new ektachrome it came out on the 1st of october im assuming its sold out everywhere since its on backorder now  personally id only shoot super8 for artsy shit

is anyone interested in doing a camera swap i have this 7s in really good condition but i never use it since getting a canon p im in canada so it would probably be easiest to swap with someone else in north america comes with a uv filter battery lens cap and a different strap
  man i would love even just a regular lx i wish they werent so expensive i guess i can settle for a k1000 or an mx
did you know anon old fogies respect the m7

should i ask this in a gear thread  ive been loving buying those fuji disposable cameras i dont know what it is but i feel holding these photos in my hand i can remember the events i just dont get with my phone photos ive been buying them since my trip to chicago in july    but i want to save up some money and actually buy a good beginner film camera most likely point and shoot cameras id say my budget is around 125 usd not including shipping i hear the canon ae1 is good but im not entirely sure to trust youtube reviewers i figure you guys would have a better idea    pic related is a triple date where some friends and i made some burgers this one just looked great to me
should i invest in this babe
  zeiss ikon is basically the same thing for half the price or less
  the ql17 giii version is better
  ae1 is overrated and overpriced check out the pentax spotmatic and k100 different lens mounts but pretty similar if you were willing to spend a bit more i can recommend the pentax mx relatively compact sure but you should also research the olympus om series
should i get an m4 w/ a 35mm voigtlander or a contax t3 the contax is definitely smaller and quick to use
  literally go to a thrift store or a car boot sale and pick up whatever camera you can find      do you need it      apples and oranges
  apples and oranges    true i guess i should be asking what camera i should get first instead of at all
so i checked at my photolab and i am getting light leaks on both my backs they arent as big as this and for the most part they dont even make it into the frame i am going to scan and post the negs this weekend or next week it is a pentax 645 so i have no fucking clue where the light could be entering from considering how far up unto the camera the film insert goes i think i will start using electrical tape to tape a seal around the insert when i put it in from no on    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makeepsoncamera modelperfectionv600camera softwareadobe photoshop lightroom classic 80 windowsimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution240 dpivertical resolution240 dpiimage created20181105 173119color space informationsrgb

are canon ae1s good
  are you ever gonna want more than one lens    are you willing to pay 1500 for a camera    why not adopt a canon p with a 35mm 18 for about 400 total both near mint
  film is a meme
  overpriced because of meme camera status the canon a1 is better
  thats a good question really i guess i could grab that and just forget about the overpriced shit for now
got a faulty canon canonet original yesterday for 10 the viewfinder is cloudy and the focus on the lens doesnt work its stuck at macro distance aperture and shutter speed seem to work im going into a new job early next year so i figure ill have spare money to throw at a cla     anybody know of a reputable uk repairer that deals with vintage cameras ill get a quote and see if its worth doing otherwise i can always get a refund
  is this a serious question the m4 is a camera you can always get repaired if something breaks and more importantly you get get different lenses for compared to any film leica the t3 is a piece of junk and if it breaks thats it    while the p seems a nice camera you restrict yourself to m39/ltm only if thats enough for you there is no reason to get an m at an m however you can use mmount and m39/ltm anyway it seems to me that you were ready to invest in a contax ps and at that point id say you can invest in an m4 thats going to last you for a lot longer      looks muddy adjust the white point and add some contrast

anyone using nikon coolscan with nikon scan  do your scans have purple tint mine do even though i think they shouldnt
  overpriced for what they are most of the internal mechanisms are plastic    eos 650 for something newer and tougher    f1 for something older and tougher  and less mememtic
  eos 650  later rebel is good advice for somebody wanting full automode to start with the difference in lens mount is worth noting though
  im thinking about upgrading to the contax t2 or t3 is it worth it   im tired of midtier look of the mju ii and the contax t3/4
  see 
  i have a 650 also it cost me e25 with a 18 lens just a random ebay bid that came up     it is cheap it is incredibly effective and reliable manual mode is useable it can use the latest and most expensive l lens from your canon dealer and every major function of the lens  like is  will work

  theres no way to really know for sure of course  it looks cheap and expired i would guess kodak gold or maybe fuji c200
  youre right ill stick with getting the m4
  thank you anon ill look into these films
  dont get at me if you dont like the m4 all i say is that any film m is going to increase in value as long as film exists and you can always get it repaired if something breaks
  additonally consider the focal lengths you want to shoot the m4 doesnt have 28mm framelines while m4p does if youre ok with 35mm as your widest lens without external finder the m2 and m42 are your options if you dont need a builtin lightmeter

nikon fa bit the dust some mechanism tied with the double exposure fucked itself and the camera wont advance cla or buy a new one
  clearly it belongs in your anus
  no thats what my k1000 is for
is lomo 100 good for portraits i hate how desaturated things like portra are ektar looks cool but i heard it makes skin look weird
whats the difference in color editing between photoshopping a scan and using a color enlarger  my understanding is that one works on rgb and more on selective channels the other cmyk on the overall tone
  provia 100f is the way to go
  photoshop is a lot easier gives you more control everything printing on a color enlarger basically lets you correct the color cast of the print and the density it can produce good results but you wont be able to get the level of saturation of an inkjet print it can be really finicky with some films such as underexposed ektar and split toning is almost impossible to correct also the paperwhite is a lot more grey on ra4 paper
contax t2 is overrated i sold mine because it was too heavy too big and inferior to the olympus mjuii
  same also its just too damn valuable made me feel hesitant to actually take it anywhere the stupid huge brick dimensions of it were the main reason though also the lens was pretty underwhelming the only things going for it are the build quality and extensive controls but in the end i might as well just grab a slr
  whats the difference in color editing between photoshopping a scan and using a color enlarger  you cant control contrast in ra4 printing

lads im so fed up with c41 that im quitting colour photo for now for some reason going from unicolor to cinestill kits everything is fucked already lost 3 rolls to it  generally am only getting opaque/ cyan inverse negatives am i developing too long
  you could try e6 with slide film to start its a little more forgiving with temperature and time    but perhaps try black and white for a while its a lot easier
  just let it develop in a lab c41 is such a hassle to develop otherwise play around with black and white developer a bit its more forgiving
  that shit theyve been selling thats mildly expired my nigga i got tons of that shit too went straight into the freezer for now but i think i got 15 rolls
    if you can get the chemicals saw some fag selling ecn2 kits on ebay for 60 ecn2 is far more forgiving and easier color process than c41 or e6 if you do the remjet removal stage right it comes off with ease    literally ecn2 is remove remjet heat developer pour into tank agitate every 45 seconds and 3 minutes later dump and stop then blix hell one time i didnt even use stop chem just rinsed a dozen times then blixed and the results were still on par
is c41 really that much of a pain do you guys use some kind of heater to maintain the temperature
  just a hot tub of water to regulate the tempreture and a freezer bag
  i got a 10 temp controller on amazon and plugged a 10 aquarium heater into it then i added a 5 aquarium pump to keep things circulating i keep my chemicals in there for a bit before developing and then i have the tank in it while developing works great i can keep everything within 5c of set point and it all just goes into the plastic tub for storage when im done    ive gotten extremely consistent results across i think 20 something rolls now of c41 film
  thanks for the info anon i havent even received my camera yet but i was wondering if aquarium shit would work
  ofc the slow version of the process at 30c works great im in the /p/ discord if you need any advice
  i do c41 with nothing but a sink thermometer and electric kettle i just eyeball the temperature on the thermometer and pour in some more boiling water as needed  i have no idea how badly people are messing up when they say their process went tits up i have never had a bad roll come out past my first two rolls ive only ever used tetenal kits that might have helped
  post an example sure youre not just being a retard when scanning      its easy as fuck 50 sous vide and 6 pair of aquarium thermometers to ensure temps are what the sous vide reads never had any issues aside from me being stupid about agitating and getting uneven development    e6 is better tho c41 is for loosers
  no theyre not

  shes bought you a camera strap nigs perhaps one that lacks practically significant features such as a rubberized side in the middle though i wouldnt know also keep holding your breath on them ultron snaps theyre just a leap of procastrinations away    also did yalls know that hanging around old photographers fascinating as it is to hear about olden things makes you a fuckton more of an old fogey yourself i should shoot a punk gig to compensate or something fucking hell
  she listened to me when i was talking about that strap and then got one for me i recently passed on some ultron but to be honest biddings went way too high for its condition   it can be interesting to hang out with the old ones grab a flash and that ultron and shoot some show i bet its going to be fun
  i wouldnt be surprised
where do i get extra film strip i need to pull out my film but i dont have extra film strip around
  get a film extractor
crack sip    ah yes those were the days when analog film was king
  c41 is way easier to develop to me at least its much faster 1012 minutes and done any color casts are easily fixed in photoshop so im not worried about dead perfect temperatures    standing around developing delta 3200 for 40 minutes between dev fix and rinse last night not fun
  why is his arm coming out of his gut
hello wanted to ask a question about pushing film which is better to push to 1600 portra 800 or fuji venus 800
  fuji venus 800  dont push c41
  why not
  colour shifts im parroting here
  im going to be at a placr with low light and need iso 800 but 1600 would be even better so recommendations for pushing c41 to 1600 would be appreciated
  i havent pushed more than 1 stop so far but as expected it only increased contrast       the tetenal kit instructions recommend to increase development time by 30s per pushed stop at 38c id go with portra 400
  indoor low light if so have fun with totally fucked colours due to light temperature    im about to try a roll of portra 400  1600 developed normally ill prob process and scan in the next few days
  im about to try a roll of portra 400  1600 developed normally  have fun with your green shadows
  as if shooting at box is any differetnt
  youll have to break open a film roll savage style and then once youve developed it you can snip off a piece to use from then on
  shooting at box speed doesnt result in images that are underexposed by 2 stops when developed normally portra handles overexposure very well but can look nasty when underexposed  heres some portra 400 at box in artificial low light skin colors look ok to me but you can clearly see the blue/green cast in the shadows i mentioned before    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpi

  thats why id rather push and deal with increased contrast
  im about to try a roll of portra 400  1600 developed normally  developed normally    not the definition of push processing
  i never said i was pushing it i said i was deving normally and that ill post so the other anon can see how it looks without even bothering to push
  looks terrible to me but nufilm kiddos love that grainy underexposed look because for some reason their only reference point for film is underexposed family snapshots from moms 80s point and shoot and indie folk meme album covers
  1 stop underexposed looks alright to me but anything more just looks mushy and gross  t 19 year old
      i found a point and shoot camera with built in flash ill just use that and not risk it thanks for the help guys i fucking love these /fgt/ threads
  were all /fgt/s here so you should never hesitate to ask if you need a helping hand if you know what i mean
    as long as you guys keep loving these threads ill keep reposting them

  did you like attempt to focus or anything i kinda doubt that the split prism is fine and the rest is shit the image is bounced off the mirror into a ground glass above the mirror before hitting the pentaprism check to see if the ground glass is fogged or something more than usual that is its going to be a dull glassy finish by nature again make sure you actually tried to focus the camera with a lens on it set it to infinity and look at the window or something
bought expired ektachrome 64t  shot a test roll and waited a month for dev  slides are 90 purple faded  kodak expired films never again
  okay this is gonna go a little /sqt/ but anyway  it seemed to work well enough i did get a clear image in said splitprism still familiarising with the terminology with the rest of the image looking a little darker and duller     what was interesting to see was when i adjusted on a vertical line from closer or afar the more the line came into focus the closer both semicircles lined up until it was an unbroken line unbroken lines up close were broken ones from afar  i assume this is the point of the split prism    as you said the image when bounced up does go through a wafer of ground glass producing the effect  is this removable do i want it to be removable i typically like having a complete fullframe feedback on what the entire image will look like instead of straining my eyes through this tiny spot
  watch some youtube videos on how to use manual slr cameras image in viewfinder is most likely dull because of slow lens lenses with apertures of 4 will produce a dark dull image in a viewfinder

well guys the only store in australia that stocks tetenal dev kits has told me they went bankrupt and no longer stock it    no more film for me i guess
  was it thefilmblokes i use to buy from there but they closed there online store a while back and it says well be back soon i buy from deceive moment now
  45mm is nice since i usually dont shoot wide and its a beautiful camera im not sure about ae though i currently use an om1 and fullmanual is very nice to have especially since both cameras seem to take mercury cells      i was looking at the chaika line zone focus isnt something im used to but im sure that could change given the price whichever camera i end up with will be a snapshit machine anyway
i need your help /fgt/    be me  buy a bronica sq ai on ebay   guy says prism doesnt work   mfw no prism in the pictures  he confuses prism with the magnifier glass  waist viewfinder kinda broken but ok  315 eurobucks    really excited about my purchase   finally delivered    no dark slide with the back and no lever of the miror lockup   wtfdng   ask for a partial refund on ebay   he gives 35 euros   go buy 120 film   put in the bronica   viewcounter stays at s   no frame 1   keep winding   eventually film goes onto the other spool and winding is useless    wtfraf   maybe im doing it wrong   open second 120 film   carefully load   same thing   ask the seller about it   he says i dont know how to use it   he claims he took pictures with the bronica   seems like he lies   tell me to return the bronica   smell fishy   ask him money so i can buy new back    nonef   send me back the bronica or stfu      ok fellows how do you return an item safely i dont want him to say that he never received the camera nor im the one who broke it     can i get a refund of the shipping cost     also does anyone have any experience with this frame counter issue
  dont know havent developed it yet will update
anyone here have or use a noblex 150 u pros / cons
    chaika  on the /fgt/ page
  the film counter in your back is busted been there seen it done that  heres a howtofix it wwwinstructablescom/id/fixingabrokenfilmtransportonabronicasqaf/  but from my own experience of fiddling with these broken backs dont bother  most of the time its because a teeth of one of the gears has corroded and theres nothing you can do about it but buy a new back
  just use the tiny curved bit leader at the beginning that you cut off of a different roll
    the split prism is a focusing aid whatever you want in focus should line up in that spot by turning the focusing ring on the lens the rest of the matte field should be bright and clear showing you the whole image and come into focus as a whole not just the tiny prism spot  if its quite dark the lens aperture is stopped down im not really that much familiar with olympus om system but if i recall correctly theres a button or lever on the lower right side of the lens to preview the depth of field that one closes the aperture and darkens the whole image dunno how it works on those lenses like if its a push and hold to engage or a push to engagepush again to disengage but you should check that button out maybe its stuck or something    the ground glass is the focusing screen its extremely fragile and scrateches easily so dont mess with it no amount of dirt on it will darken the image enough to make it unusable
      do you happen to remember how long this roll has been expired i currently have the first roll of fujichrome 100 expired in 89 in my nikon   im halfway through with bracketing to test the best way to shoot the other 9 rolls was given a pack of 10 for free but these pics really make me think i should cross process or even just toss them
  not sure the expiration date on the roll i shot but im guessing sometime in the 90s the canister looked like pic related but asa 100

  unironicallyeverything is a meme
  youre kidding yourself if you think you need anything else
    600mm f/4
  while this is true my favourite lens the 50 has lost its sharpness i cant seem to find any mold though its esp noticeable when i adapt it to a modern camera
  dont bother  you paid market value of a functioning camera but you got one thats broken in multiple places  1 waistlevel finder is broken those things can cost 100 for a good condition one  2 film back is broken  missing a dark slide a good condition one is easily 8090  3 mirror lockup lever is broken people specifically pay more for the sqa and sqai models for the mirror lockup functionality     at this point its a money pit youve already gone through two waisted rolls thats another 1520  maybe you feel its easier to get the camera working since you have it in your hands but its not your problem plus you dont know how much else is wrong with the camera i wouldnt trust it to be fully functional with all those issues already      get a full refund try to see if you can get a refund for shipping expenses as well open a paypal case pack the camera take a photo of the packed camera in the box before you close the box   then take the lens out and keep it for your trouble and send the rest  open a paypal case describing all the issues and saying the camera was advertised as functioning but is fully nonfunctional/broken attach the photo of the camera in the box that youre sending back    paypal will 100 side with you in this case
  use this as an excuse to buy the 50mm f/14 lens
i was thinking about doing double exposures where i expose an entire roll rewind it and then expose it again i was just wondering if there is any way to make sure the frames align the second time around anyone knows anything regarding this
  could be i occasionally get weird streaks in ways ive never seen before i kind of think its just something thats going to happen occasionally
  21mm 75/85mm and 180/200mm

  mount camera on tripod for shot lock in place take first exposure of picture 1  without moving camera from tripod rewind take second exposure of picture 1    repeat for first exposure of picture 2 except skip over picture 1 by activating shutter with lens cap  repeat whole process for second exposure of picture 2    and so on with a number of skips equal to however many double exposed pictures youve already taken this way you can take each shot completely finalised without having to take everything again from the front    instead of 1234rewind 1234  do 1r1 2r12 3r123 and so on
  some cameras have a lever that allows you to cock the shutter without advancing the film check if yours has it
anyone here use 675 hearingaid batteries as a replacement for the 625 mercury battery i see people on forums talking about 140 volt 675 and ive seen someone say that those put the light meter 1 stop over but the ones where i live are labeled 145v do you figure 145v would put the meter 2 stops over any experience

  use the batteries you have test against an actual proper dslrs light meter across a number of situations and use any difference as a percentage calibration ie write on the side compensate reading by 15 or something
  i would if i had a dslr or knew anyone that does ill just have to get by with the app and hope it comes out alright ill try testing in different situations tomorrow since right now its night time also going to take the sunny 16 into account
  personally i would cut the 35mm and call the 3 enough i dont know what 28mm you have but the 28mm f/28 ais is a really really good lens
   283550  jesus christ why i can understand someone with a rangefinder having all three but with an slr its not like youre doing quick or quiet street anyways theres no reason to own lens more than a factor of 16x apart in focal length 5028 or 3575/85 are the pairs you should consider why would you ever need the 35 if you have 50 and 28 covered i can only think of studio size reasons    anyways try for something very wide if you must have a new lens 20mm or wider 18mm or wider will prevent further gear fagging
  everything about this sounds fine the split prism is going to be brighter than the rest 100 of the time its clear glass vs dull glass    if you got an image to show after focusing youre fine if the image is dark consider a f/14 or faster main lens at f/14 the image should be brighter and also these 14 lenses for old slrs tend to be cheap and very good

  got off my arse and just did a few tests of the luna pro vs d800   the luna seems to be within 51 stop of the nikon although some of the error is probably caused by the fact that the user has to determine where to put the computer wheel based on the exposure reading  id say that on the 675 batteries its more than close enough for most work i might be a little wary about slides    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makenikon corporationcamera modelnikon d200camera softwareadobe photoshop elements 50 20060914r77  windowsmaximum lens aperturef/48sensing methodonechip color areacolor filter array pattern1010focal length 35mm equiv93 mmimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20080930 152348white point chromaticity03exposure time1/160 secfnumberf/63exposure programnormal programiso speed rating100exposure bias0 evmetering modespotlight sourceunknownflashflash return detectedfocal length6200 mmcolor space informationuncalibratedimage width1557image height2118renderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardgain controlnonecontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormalsubject distance rangeunknown

protip for anyone dont buy a cheap barnack leica with bad curtains thinking you can just replace them yourself either buy one you know is good or get a pro cla    i thought i had quite a bit of experience with camera repairs but my iiif has been a complete pita   cutting and installing new curtains is challenging but doable though in hindsight you really have to be careful and do it _perfectly_ but calibrating that goddamn shutter has been nothing but horseshit the hours ive wasted tweaking shutter tension and checking with a cheapo shutter speed tester fiddling with light sources opening it up and putting it back together again shooting and developing test rolls    first i thought i had finally nailed the shutter timings only to find out some heavy shutter capping at 1/1000s  now i wanted to fix that so i sped up the first curtain and slightly loosened tension on the second curtain again tested with shutter tester everything seems fine put it all back together and shoot a test roll to find out that now at 1/1000s the shutter somehow doesnt open at all anymore film remains completely unexposed    i just want to throw this unholy brass brick out of the window and finally get some peace
  yeah looks like a leak on the front side its more common on the epic/mju ii though where light can leak from around the lens    if it only appears on bright and harsh light i wouldnt worry too much
  should of just got a canon ltm
  nah but im about to now love the pics

how is this camera functions optical quality i saw one advertising for a decent price and i like the look of it apparently 2x3 film are hard to find nowadays so i would have to shoot 120 film through a 620 film adapter that seems like a real hassle
  why not just get a 120 camera
  i like the look of it and you can wiggle the lens a bit ive never handled a lf so it would be nice to experience it plus its cheap
  optical quality is going to depend intirely on the lens you didnt post what lens is on it
  if it has a graflock back you can attach many different kind of 120 roll film backs
  these cameras are gimmicks nowadays you will get bored of one in 2 weeks  only buy if you will use them as decoration to impress hipster girls when you invite them over

any thoughts on adox cms 20 im a slide film person with color and like what i see with adox 20 high contrast thin latitude high resolving power and sharpness also in sunlight i can be around the f/2856 range which i personally prefer to be if i can no nd its not cheap for black and white but very reasonable compared to color slide    goddamn dude get a 4x5 at least if youre gonna get a camera like this better images and more lens selection about the same size
  any thoughts on adox cms 20  in 120 it curls like crazy not sure about 35mm require special adotech developer shoot at iso 10 and shorter dev times extremely gentle agitaion just move dev tank in a figure 8 motion on the table    i like rollei atp better
  man that grain is not really pleasing i want to experiment with foma 400 but all the examples ive seen seem to indicate that the 200 is much better even at 400 so thats what ive been using when i want cheap mf since gp3 isnt readily available anymore i have shot a roll or two of the 400 in 120 but ive yet to develop any    whats the lqn a copy of i like excel cant really see any difference between it and xtol    also speaking of foma their rc paper is really good i find curls a fair bit during dev  drying but is totally flat after its dry both the pearl and matt are nice
  gp3 isnt readily available anymore      
  speaking of foma  you should try their fiber paper fomabrom 111 is the best paper ever highly praised by bruce barnbaum as well
  grain looks shit in the sky but is ok otherwise as i wrote the film was exposed to light and most negatives are ruined best result with foma 400 was in hc110 1100 stand    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makeplustekcamera modelopticfilm 8200icamera softwareadobe photoshop cs51 windowsimagespecific propertiesimage width2496image height1692number of bits per component8 8 8pixel compositionrgbimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution600 dpivertical resolution600 dpiimage created20181003 223421image width2496image height1692color space informationsrgbimage width667image height1000
  i dont have the possibility of doing fiber yet but ill keep that in mind for sure      hmm looks like its back then more expensive than i remember though most places seem to sell the foma 200 in 120 for around 4 euros per roll and i think its a better film i think i paid closer to 3 euros per roll back when i bought a small pile of gp3
i have been looking to try foma 4x5 film for a while now its like 50 cents a sheet which makes it really appealing to experiment with how does it hold up when compared to higher end film in 120 the samples ive seen around the web look quite ok i think foma 100 has a neat look to it
  provai 100f and velvia 50 35mm short date are only 699 at bh      
ive been shooting on a pentax k1000 for a couple years now got 300ish to throw at a more portable and nicer 35mm camera/lens recs    mostly shooting with wide angles 50mm at the most a doall 28 or 35 would be neat
  fomapan 100 is a great film utter shit reciprocity though slightly worse than fp4 but i like fomapan 100 more in everything else actually only acros 100 is above foma 100 and gp3 for me somehow gp3 just looks amazing in rodinal 150 oh and delta 100 is really nice in pyrocathd and xtol
  thanks the reciprocity is worrying for sure it ramps up really fast

  doesnt matter if he takes alright photos or not hes a cock gobbling pretentious hypebeast cunt dick riding the current resurgence of film i watched one of his videos and couldnt last 30 seconds hes just another view chasing overly excited clickbaity youtuber yeah now that i think about it hes just a youtuber who happens to make videos on photography nothing more nothing less   you honestly cant tell me im wrong after reading this green text  kingjvpes is an analog photography website/blog but is also a youtube channel content is always related to film photography and the art behind it sharing information to new and seasoned veterans to keep the love for film photography alive and going filmisnotdead  my name jonathan paragas creator if kingjvpes my love for analog photography started is fueled by a passion for street photography something about the two go hand in hand and the purity of seeing an image and then using your own two hands to mix chemistry and make an image is pure magic film being a dying art one of my main goals with kingjvpes is to expand and recover the lost art being 20 years old part of my life was shot mostly all on film then it disappeared i want to be a part of the resurgence and hopefully we can bring film back to life
    yet hes done far more to keep film photography alive by driving film sales than you ever will he probably singlehandedly though indirectly funded kodak to bring back ektachrome

how do you feel about making do with only one focal length  there are times when i could use a 50mm on my bronica sq but i feel i should stick to the 80mm so theres consistency across my photos like when i was using a tlr
  i mean the colors and pumpkins actually make this a pretty decent shot would only be good in a series though and probably not one of just other porches id think more of an americana culture in fall sort of thing thats people centric with shots like this thrown in
  depends on the focal length on 35mm i would be able to get around with a 35mm lens  normal enough for normal shots wide enough for wide shots the holy grail of lenses id say its all around more useful than a 50 for sure but i love the 50 focal length and could definitely survive on that 35 would be good with a long lens in the 75100 or so range prime 50 would be good with a 1825mm or so range prime but those two lenses are survivable on their own    medium format i am very content with my texas leica has an equivalent 38mm focal length almost as sharp as a good small format lens so i can crop for longer shots quite a bit actually  i get virtually native small format quality when cropping down to a 35x24 or so area and about a 90mm field of view    in 4x5 format i couldnt survive with one lens i have the equivalents of a 35mm and 70mm which seems to cover 99 of situations am considering a longer lens and a very wide lens 135mm equivalent and 18mm equivalent respectively    in 8x10 i find that its so big and bulky that a 50mm equivalent works perfectly on its own but doesnt stop me from getting some more lenses for that my semiwide for 4x5 covers 8x10 which has a 17mm equivalent for that format    in short yes and no depends on format im using whether i can survive with one lens or two smaller formats yes with reservations larger formats definitely fucking not
  i wouldnt worry about consistency i cant even tell visually which of the 3 sqa lenses i used for some of my photos though i could tell you because i remember you can make wide angles seem like telephotos and telephotos seem like normals etc

  the funny thing was this was shot at a uc campus around 230 in the afternoon lol     but good looks man i appreciate the suggestion and advice
hey guys so ive been into 35mm for awhile started out on a busted pentax really young and since then loved it recently though i have been really wanting to get into medium format im having a hard time finding a setup to start on want something somewhat compact any help would be great
im very new to film kind of new to photography as well     sorry for wall too    i prefer street photography i realise this has to go fast many times i found it easier to do with a dslr because you simply used auto focus and i used auto exposure in general dont hate im new     what are some tips for film specifically in regards to getting a shots fast the focusing is just a matter of learning the feel of the camera i suppose but exposure and such i find it hard to just know what number goes with whatever amount of light i have im just not experienced enough like how do you know oh this is 125 iso 800     i have a yashica fx7 if that helps     i know this is photography 101 im asking but i dont know maybe someone has some nice tangible tips
  f8 and be there is sort of a meme  but its based in reality    f8 on the lens gives you a lot of depth of field so you can afford to be less precise and faster with your focus  thereby being bette able to get shots  while still being able to get something reasonable in focus at a reasonable shutter speed  without going so far that diffraction becomes a thing
  f8 and be there     but what about light
  sunny 16 and then go from there bear in mind when youre shooting colour negative film you can overexpose up to 3 stops without any real consequences  so when in doubt lean towards more light
  focusing can be kinda memed by using a wider lens and shooting in the f/8 range like if i am expecting to shoot street or more candid shots ill use my 55mm over my 75mm on my 645 that is like using a 35mm over a 50mm
  i find it hard to just know what number goes with whatever amount of light i have  even the most experienced photographers are handily beaten by the most basic of light meters  its normal eyes are somewhat good at judging relative brightness this is a couple ev brighter than that but quite shit at judging absolute brightness this is ev12    long story short dont be a retard and use a lightmeter  either handheld or phone app or in the camera if it has one   there is also the sunny 16 rule as a last resort  theres also an extended version of it including suggestions/approximations for overcast days artificial light interiors etc
      you can over expose color negative film by a bit and over expose black and white film to hell and back most people shoot street with 400 speed black and white and shoot it at either 400 800 or 1600     sunny 16 rule would mean 400 speed film would be shot at f/16 1/500 on a sunny day and f/8 you are gaining 2 stops you could shoot at f/8 1/1000 or even 1/500 and be totally fine if it is sunny
  colors auto corrected by a scanner that spits negatives like a gattling gun  colors are weird  surprise surprise
  exposing without a light meter is fairly simple anyone can do it in daylight conditions it gets hard indoors and in dim light because eyes become very unreliable check this table for reference 
  how is exposure a problem for you when you have a fx7 it has a built in lightmeter
  is there something you find you take a picture of the most for some reason i always take a picture of the tree in my backyard  i also do this mostly when i get a new lens or when im shooting a new emulsion its interesting to see the tree change over the seasons
i want to seesaw develop a fomapan 200 how much should i move the film through the developer and then fixer 15min

  you got it the wrong way around you can easily overexpose color negative by even 5 stops without it falling apart too badly theres no reason to pull color neg pretty much ever    black and white is not so tolerant lean on slight overexposure but dont go too overboard cubic grain films can take much more but tgrain stuff start to look like shit in the highlights after about one stop of overexposure also developer choice matters as well    with black and white pulling is a lot more common to tame the contrast the same idea you accomplish by overexposing color neg many people shoot and develop eg trix and hp5 at 200 for this reason
  people shoot trix and hp5 at 800 or 1600 on purpose to make it look grainy for street photography     
  people shoot trix and hp5 at 800 or 1600 on purpose to make it look grainy for street photography  no they push to those speeds to be able to shoot around f/11  f/22 more dof for easier zone focusing and faster shutter speeds freeze action
  either way it is the opposite of what you said you said people shoot street bw at 200
  im not   also they never said people pull bw to 200 specially for street shooting they were explaining the difference between overexposing bw and colour neg

  ive shot similar cameras before theyre super fun      looks like you exposed for the sky
just got done home developing and it looks like p3200  6400 turned out extremely underexposed where as my trix in 120 not 35mm  6400 turned out contrasty and great slightly different lighting situations between the two but very disapointed going to try trix in 35mm pushed to 12800 next trying to figure out something for night time
  why are you pushing it so much 
  i dont even shoot above 6400 at night with digital the fuck are you even trying to shoot
how do you guys organize your photos right now i have all my rolls in folders but i want to start organizing them by themes what software are you using
  add tags to photos or rolls depending on theme in the file explorer or an editing software
  holy contrast my man    i shot two rolls of fp4 this summer with a yellow filter on and it was pretty mad had to print at 1 or 15 and even then the prints were super contrasty    not really a film which i would do things to that make it more contrasty filters or pushing at least with hc110 which i too used
  looks like you exposed for the sky  unfortunately yes i trusted the internal meter of the m6 instead of thinking about the scene       that contrast was exactly what i wanted a little more grain would be nice not a single good shot on that roll but i like the look    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makeplustekcamera modelopticfilm 8200icamera softwareadobe photoshop cs51 windowsimagespecific propertiesimage width3296image height2232pixel compositionunknownimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution600 dpivertical resolution600 dpiimage created20181125 230730image width3296image height2232color space informationuncalibratedimage width1000image height667

    ill try to remember it i usually just have it on the lowest highest apeture for max light did i mention im new haha        yeah the yashica fx7 i have has a battery container for a light meter its pretty easy to use just red/green and  standard im assuming i use it vigorously and experiment with deliberately keeping it low light for example           most people shoot street with 400      im guessing you mean 400 film here and having iso 400 800 or 1600 but from 400 to 1600 can you do that with colour film my local photo store litereally only has kodak gold 200 and fujifilm super or something also 200 i forget the name 100     if i were to buy any film online what would you recommend i like the softness of the colour the colour is more real i like with the lights and colour plays around ond the walls streets etc               speaking of f/x my 50mm goes from 2 28 4 56 8 11 16     and what do you mean when you say 1/500 for example yeah sorry im extremely new        well i dont with exposure specifically but i dont have the knowledge to play around most the photos come out bland in terms of lighting and id like to getan older camera at some point and i dont think they have meters     and its just good knowledge to have you know
how often should a photographer take an objectively great photo to be considered a successful or worthy photographer  one great photo a week a month more less asking since i often hit a wall and my gear rots on the shelf
stop measuring subjective standards with objective milestones if taking one good picture a month makes you feel better then good if you need the validation to consider yourself a successful photog then start an instagram and take pictures of hot girls with boobies and nice butts
  that looks like pier 24 i love that place
the absolute best most famous photographers are known for less than 25 photos that took them their entire lives to produce no one goes out and creates one great photo a month    the reality is youll never be great if you arent already working on your mfa in a respectable art school or university youre way behind and will never get there thats okay though learn to accept your mediocrity and treat photography like the passion that it should be once you deprive yourself of delusions of grandeur photography becomes much more enjoyable because you can shoot what you actually want you also get to do it on your terms which is nice
my strategy when i hit a wall was to stop giving a shit i just take photos of whatever i want and throw it up on instagram getting a few likes is always a nice little push as well even if half are bots but dont expect to be on any magazine covers anytime soon take the photos for yourself and youll never get bored of it
everyone takes shit photos its the great photos that you let the public see that matter in the end who cares how many and how far apart they happened to be two good photos will be two good photos if they were back a week apart or 10 years apart from each other
death grips is the best band on the fucking planet but they havent made a single good song let that sink in
  theres more to photography than being good or rather theres more than simply being technically good especially if your aim is to document which is the aim of many people  it doesnt always occur to us right away but if you find yourself revisiting the same subjects and recording them visually youre doing documentation in that case showing up and taking the photograph already means a lot because the moments you or others find important will not always wait for the best light to physically manifest in order for you to photograph them sometimes you have to deal with what you have which is what makes photography challenging  dealing with compromises and limitations to produce a pleasing image
  mfa   art school  this isnt even true in any medium the best writer in modern times who actually got an mfa was david foster wallace and the list gets considerably worse from there this is also true with cinema photography playwrights musicians mfa and art school are for the mediocre who need to use credentials in place of truly great work    everyone here is mediocre though sure ill give you that
    ill bet i can find way more working artists in photography with graduate education in that field than you can find working artists without
95 of everyones photos are shit prove me wrong now knowing that if you take 10k pictures a year youll have 500 good ones and probably only 20 of those will be top tier this scales with skill so a really bad photographer will have 20 good by their standards and a great photographer will have 20 great by theirs   t guy who took 15k photos last year and ended up with maybe 3040 i really liked and 500700 totally useable
  also ive noticed this trend on jobs too took about 400 photos of my friends band and ended up with 20 i liked and 5 or so really great ones
  i bet theyre working in that field thats what they went to school to get mfas to do the credentials will get them a job im not arguing that but few if any will actually be greats because the mfa program and academia can only produce mediocrity
  the credentials will get them a job im not arguing that    a job what the fuck are you talking about
    thats about right for a hit rate

sup /p/   im really torn on what camera to get ive been looking at the sony a7rii but see a lot of bad reviews on the af is it really that bad otherwise i could spend a bit more for the a7iii but the resolution on the former appeals to me ive been shooting on a canon t5 for a while the other camera i was looking at is the pentax k1 but see worse af reviews for that any other suggestions im sick of the shitty lowlight performance on my camera and have several vintage primes to use
af is a meme reason to not get a camera i have the a7rii and never noticed it to be a problem
  get whatever feels best to hold literally go to a store and just hold each camera in your budget for at least five minutes theyre all so close technologically now that its retarded to buy purely based on specs
  i have an a7rii the only times you might run into af issues is if youre shooting sports or other fast moving subjects i use mine for real estate and architectural photography but have also used it at events and for portraits and never had an issue also dont forget that lenses affect af performance so make sure you get good lenses for it
another a7rii user here  the only time af wont keep up is when something is running directly towards you really
  resolution is the biggest meme you dont need anything over 12mp
  /thread
  im really thinking on making the switch to mirrorless in my full frame upgrade as well other cameras in a similar level of the a7rii are unfortunately still slightly out of budget the 5dmk3 is still over 2k im not a fan of nikon as ive owned a few in the past and fuji is laughable unfortunately as their cameras are really cool conceptually the pentax caught my eye as being pretty exceptional for its price point but i have some old primes i would like to comfortably adapt hence wanting to go mirrorless

thank you for your bandwidth    inb4 resize
no ones saying anything
grainy but not bad what iso did you shoot that at and what developer did you use theres more grain than at tx pushed to 1600 in d76
  3200 metered for the highlights for all the shots except astro d76 at 68f for all the rolls too
  expected it to be less grainy maybe a little better than delta 3200
  ive yet to shoot delta 3200 but when i do ill compare
  id say both delta and p3200 are probably better rated at 1600 or 1000 to be honest i was disappointed by delta 3200 as i expected less grain than at pushed trix or hp5
  i would usually complain about the file size on the other hand high res film grain dayum  not mad/10
  delta 400 and in general iso400 films have less grain pushed than the native 3200 films    but they also have more contrast and less shadow detail at 3200  so its a choice between fine grain and high contrast vs shadow detail    that said i find delta 400 at 800 and 1600 pretty fantastic grain remains tight and contrast under control    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makeepsoncamera modelperfection v800/v850camera softwaresilverfast 880 r10 aug 23 2017  29aff80 2308imagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage width1091image height792

    wow empty seats so fucking deep dude xd
  this nice
  nice kino mate what were these people doing
heres my attempt during a concert shot at 3200 developed in tmax dev 14 as per the manual
will we ever start to see serious chinese cameras or lenses
  give them a few years its not just about copying its about knowing just what to copy and why    theyll figure it out
  they already have they just focus on the mass produced quickbuck
  i personally think the laowa lenses are pretty cool theyre unique not really copying any other lens and their image quality is pretty good for the type of lens they offer
  just ordered me one of these chinese ie cheap doublesided aspherical with three unicorn shavings doped elements and fairy dust coatings goes down to f/14 for not much more than an ultron 28mm f/2 and is supposedly sharp down there funky oval teardrop sort of flare because of muh asphericals and lol character ive been down for this since the 50mm f/11
  serious chinese projects    umwellnever it is basically the camera/lens version of this shit
  if only they could into af if its not an ultrawide or a macro pure manual focus is niche
  very true i dont ever use af so its not something i think about i do wonder if theyll start doing af though their spot in the market is based around cheap lenses and af seems like its not cheap
  what    chinese products can be seperated in two very different categories  1 absolute shit low quality knock offs cancer giving plastics and injury provoking stuff the general its cheap and meh but kinda works stuff  2 high quality products    currently many of them lack costumer service and support but i can imagine this to become better in the future its kind of scary to see them taking over markets like photography  most of my gear is allready chinese sirui tripod smallrig rig godox flashsystem phottix light modifier peak design strap
  af itself isnt that expensive but if youre not just cloning a existing lens like yongnuo does you need serious engineering
  peak design is chinese i thought they were from california      yeah i can imagine especially if youre a third party needing to make af work with canon sony nikon and whatever other cameras
  yongnuo managed to figure out nikon and canon af so i reckon its just a matter of time before one of the chinese mf lens companies does or just buys the tech from yongnuo
  yongnuos af is shit though users dont complain much because the lens costs 50 but for eg laowa that wont be considered acceptable
  what    anon thought you were posting the 7artisans 28 14 thats coming out shortly     i love that theres a chinese player in the rangefinder lens space personally even if i dont think theyre quite there yet for quality    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cs6 macintoshimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpicolor space informationsrgbimage width1080image height1440scene capture typestandard
  peak design is chinese i thought they were from california  oh god your right where the hell did i get this miss information from  
  was thinking about getting one as well i decided against it for the following reasons their dof scales are wonky and judging by their example shots on the website this lens has tons of barrel distortion its also too large in my opinion if they made a compact 28 28 id buy it even if it flares and distorts
  cheap chinese shit is less shit every year only a matter of time
what they need to do is make a proper digital rangefinder id buy one is the price is right rd1 is getting harder to find and i will never have leica money
chinese precision making isnt there on the japanese scale japanese by in large can still get optics done correctly with a high level of qc really makes it costly investment against the germans and japanese when germans own the highend market and the japanese make affordable but rather good premium market koreas samyang is pretty amazing stuff for the cost but the image quality isnt there yet id say 1020 years more    yongnuo is something same with godox and the flash market in general its not hard to make speedlights and studio strobes
  yeah theres complex distortion according to reviews it appears to be the brands first experiment with aspherical stuff seeing as how other brands dont get the teardrop flare and distortion that seems odd for a rangefinder mirrorless lens    however im a willing guinea pig simply because leitz 28mm f/14 asph costs like ten times as much
  same for the noctilux vs their 50mm 11 id rather get an ultron 28mm f/2 or used elmarit 28 but personally i got no lens faster than f/2 anyway
  it appears that 7artisans is for mmount like soviet sources were for m39 lenses back in the cold war era a considerable percent of what luxes and crons and whatnot do for a generous rounding error of the price so like a chinese cosinavoigtländer without the longestablished optics talent cosina has in japan and with a different idea of what character traits ie flaws a lens should have ie be left with at its price point    thing is for me as a filmfag fast lenses are the makeorbreak between shooting delta or tmz at ev2 or ending up with blurry garbage given how decent the 50mm f/11 is at f/14 mainly limited by focusing method and depth of field rather than optics or shooting handheld im quite happy to see a lens supposedly sharp wide open but at the same time it does still cost more than an ultron perhaps thisll drive ultrons price up
  im also shooting film but i rather push a stop or two or use a flash i rarely shoot wide open even if i know the lens produces good results
  but anon you dont need af for such an ultra wide lens really
i still find plenty of good 2nd hand lenses at goodwill stores thrift shops and similar my best find this past summer was a complete nikon d5200 w/1855 is  5300 is zoom at a small thrift store run by a hospice provider for 65
  will we ever start to see serious chinese cameras or lenses  when perceptions change  people dont realise that in china you can get from bottom barrel stuff all the way up to the high end according to what you pay      china has all the manufacturing/industrial capacity and the engineers to produce top quality lenses not just very good lenses but ones rivaling zeiss and leica  one of the biggest cost of a high end lens is labour human labour spent in inspection quality control fine tuning by hand etc and china has incredibly cheap skilled labour compared to germany or japan  they could easily design and then handpick the lenses with the tightest tolerances test them and finetune them on the optical bench and cherry pick the best performers all that for maybe 600 selling to you for 1000 so you could get summilux performance for a fraction of the price or better than summilux for 2000    the problem though is market perception people are not willing to pay 2000 for chinkaron 35mm f/14 even though it deats the summilux in optical and build quality cause theres a preconception that chinese stuff is cheap crap  of course this is not helped by the fact that most chinese manufacturers decide to sell a 150 production cost lens for 500 than a 500 lens for 600 pocketing higher margins so all we get is midlow tier stuff by design
  the 35mm af is fine never had a problem however focusing manually with it sucks because its pretty loose
  and i said what    if its not an ultrawide pure manual focus is niche
  people are not willing to pay 2000 for chinkaron 35mm f/14 even though it deats the summilux in optical and build quality     almost no one buys a summilux for its optical quality
  no they buy it for its name which is pretty much exactly the point of the guy youre responding to
  id like to point out that the two prior 7artisans mmount lenses are still marked by china solutions where other manufacturers move the focus cam using a screw 7artisans machines it into literally a single incline on the edge of a barrel theres also the uneven clickless aperture ring of the 50mm f/11 which is sort of laughable for shooting w/ a selfmetering flash with these are all factors of cheaping out which one doesnt see in eg voigtländer lenses    but then again the 7a lenses are user adjustable for focusing given access to a digital mmount body mostly because of that design and its still miles better than any spin of jupiter3
  try samyang xp lineup manual focus but quite stellar performance
  lack of clicking on aperture is really very laughable ive opened up tons of old rangefinder lenses for repair and most of them get super smoot click action from a simple 15mm bearing ball squished against an indebted metal plate the whole thing probably costs another 10 cents to manufacture
  we already have with every canikon fujiblad sonyzeiss pentax shit lens made within the last 1520 years
    2019  cali based startup  more people employed in rd than marketing  holy shit

this was from a test i was doing on the optical image stabilization for the 400mm f/28 a white subject on white background at a full sprint did a great job tracking focus and keeping the images sharp not super impressed with my photos here not super exciting but at least it focused well
one of my favorites this old man is probably in his mid20s since polar bears only live to be about 1518 years old that means hes a mean motherfucker with a lot of gnarly shit in his past he looks worn down here but its super impressive for a bear to reach this age    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce7rm3camera softwareadobe photoshop lightroom classic 80 macintoshmaximum lens aperturef/28focal length 35mm equiv400 mmimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution320 dpivertical resolution320 dpiimage created20181127 111519exposure time1/2500 secfnumberf/45exposure programmanualiso speed rating800lens aperturef/45brightness95 evexposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length40000 mmcolor space informationsrgbrenderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal
why do you repost the same pic to your instagram over and over and over again
    i dont recall posting my ig here     regardless its social media and igs algorithm rewards consistent posting as well as posts that garner high engagement its the same as a company using the same photo for multiple ad placements
how do you get gigs like this

  was the 12k for that safari paid out of pocket or by sony
    yeah these photos werent taken in any park there is no us national park with polar bears also this thread is not to discuss social media once again thanks for stopping by but this isnt the purpose of this thread
    neither
  its 4chan bucko get used to it    
muh elusive polar bears    how many other photogs were there btw
    several things here      i wasnt at nanuk     nanuk isnt in a us national park     nanuk isnt in any park    thanks for playing
  you know damn well that im talking about your entire derivative portfolio not just this single canned photoshoot on a safari in canada stop being coy
    im not sure what exactly you consider canned about hiking around in polar bear country and photographing wild polar bears you come across as someone with no experiences throwing a tantrum out of jealousy
    very nice especially the aurora borealis and the senior bear was the a7 good to handle with gloves on
  i actually dont have a problem with you specifically its the whole influencer culture that youre dickriding so hard like milk it all you want but dont go pretending youre some original adventure photographer who is breaking the mold and pushing the limits of the medium no its the same shit the same blown out spots the same tried and true subjects just processed differently
campy seagull photos
  i want to see this one day desu
    i dont identify as an influencer in any way and i dont operate as one either scroll through my feed you wont find a single sponsored post from the last 5 months     however i am a full time photographer and 80 of my work is from expedition companies and governmental tourism boards a lot of it is uncharted stuff in exotic locations however that doesnt go on my instagram because thats not what works on ig i dont really care shrug
    its worth every penny you spend getting there
  a lot of it is uncharted stuff in exotic locations  doubttiff
  was it in churchill fuuuck im so jealous i wanna go there once before i die

  very ugly dude
    umm honestly it wasnt great but im not sure any camera would have been easy it was 30c so light gloves werent going to cut it not matter what i use vallerret gloves which are specifically designed for photography but it just kinda sucks when its that cold

  yes i agree we have a northern lights caged up in our local zoo too
  in the canadian arctic    yeah these photos werent taken in any park there is no us national park with polar bears    is canada art of the us i always wondered
      composition is pretty amateur desu
  art  part
  hiking  suuure    i lived up north polar bears are like raccoons up there always hanging around the dumps their numbers have been way up the past 30 years and they are in no way elusive    i have no issues with what you shoot but you have a very inflated ego for a guy who shoots what amounts to giant seagulls
  i like this one but i think it would be better tighter or wider like as a headshot contrasting the white fur with the orange brush or wider to put the bear in a bit more context    but such is the nature of working with wild animals
  you can see them in fucking podunk wisconsin stop romanticizing this goon
          you guys are the reason this forum sucks so fucking bad now we used to have photo threads all the time and now its just faggoty ass gear threads and idiots posting shitty out of focus blurry shots of their fucking sidewalks we have like maybe 3 good photographers on this entire board and when one shows up to try and share some photos you people just attack him because you cant handle the fact that maybe someone takes photos that arent highcontrast film who cares if you love the photos at least theyre in focus and theyre sure as hell more exciting than 95 of the garbage posted in the recent picture threads     this forum used to be decent and then all the actual photographers left because of cunts like you     op i like the shots maybe not my specific flavor but im glad to see an actual photo thread for a once continue
  op isnt actually a good photographer though op is good at marketing and has good gear the photos themselves are pretty average
  sees a photo thread of pictures taken somewhere cool  posts how any idiot who went there couldve gotten those pictures  feels selfsatisfied  dick gets hard  decides to have a wank to the feeling of how much you owned the op  satisfiedsighdng  moves on to next thread  never leaves mothers basement  camera collects more dust in the corner
  relax op so not everybody is impressed with your shots deal with it
  im not the op im some dude whos never been north of toronto whos jealous of the op and thinks his pictures are pretty awesome
  uncharted    i dont care about the stupid drama you guys have or whatever but op im not sure you know what that word means
  pretty much this i dont know what kicks people get from bashing people for good shots but im betting theres a huge deal of envy net addiction and unhealthy amount of gerfaggotry disease present
          i would like to fourth this motion not sure why people feel the need to shit on the only decent photo thread weve had in months but its obnoxious         you think theyre average have you seen the dogshit photos posted to this board by the hundreds every week 
  confusing average with 4chan average
  taken just for you thanks for noticing

    acknowledging that 4chan average is absolute trash but continuing to shittalk decent photographers to make himself feel better about his own trash life
      ok kiddo op already acknowledged that churchill isnt uncharted but he did show an example of some pretty remote work     the adults are talking though so you can go to bed now and come back when youre not so grumpy
  kiddo  adults  bed    you seem pretty triggered for an adult

  oh god its that pretentious 16k of gear goes to the zoo fagot    i got a real kick out of all the samefagging you did in this thread    screen capping this threat because i think there will be a few people that will get a kick out of seeing where their money is going
why is everyone so ass mad about this guy what am i missing
  they envy him is what id guess some of the criticisms are valid but taken to hyperbolic extremes to the point where the criticism loses any merit
    why do you care what op does with his gear and who is their money im lost
  400mm 28 did you rent the lens or do you own it i need one of those /
  dudes a literal sony shill so
    youre out of your goddamned mind if you think sony just tosses around 12k lenses to people for any reason let alone posting on /p/
    this happens every time he posts in one form or another going back a couple of years now  ill say no more
  why is everyone so ass mad about this guy      any interest in a photo thread    one more for now    fucked up sizing here too lazy    repost the same pic to your instagram over and over and over again    ok thanks for stopping by    thanks for stopping by    thanks for playing    i dont really care shrug    dude    umm    lol  its 85 the photographer and 15 the camera    just listen to him speak and imagine being in a small lodge for a week without killing him and disposing his body where the polar bears are  hey dudes i went out to take some pictures here ill show them to you since you begged for them so much  uuuum ok i showed you one now ask for more   yeah id was so rad outside im doing such cool things and you are basically losers  why do i even come to this lodge anymore i could be in peru hanging with other cool people   if your online persona is so unlikable why should we care about your snapshots if its its 85 the photographer so 85 of your pictures are shit
  pretty much this its the standard entitled boulderite attitude to be fair though everyone else that paid 12k for a photo shoot safari probably also sniffs their own farts just as much     also his beer is as mediocre as his photography there i said it
  youre out of your goddamned mind if you think sony just tosses around 12k lenses to people for any reason    12k is pocket fluff compared to mainstream advertising costs
  ive been here all summer    do please fuck off you would have shriveled up and turned into a weeping mess if you were around /p/ crits 8 years ago id argue that faggots like you ruined this place by turning it into a just another pointless internet hugbox     op i like the shots  literally just as vapid and pointless and someone saying shit sucks come back to reality you soft queer
  summed it up nicely no issue with the shots just the bullshitting and selfimportance    dude took some roadside shots of a very common animal and expects everyone to bow down
    people started irrationally attacking him before he started getting annoyed with people irrationally attacking him     any attitude you think he has is way the fuck less annoying to me than the attitude of theyre just the same pictures of wild polar bears that anyone with pro gear on a 12000 polar bear photography expedition would get from people who probably havent gotten off their asses to take a picture in months     it is the sourest of grapes in here
  unrelated can you post a photo thread sometime in the near future

wtf lads i hate snoy now
    op here thank you i know 4chan doesnt attract the reddit style circle jerk but its weirdly angry in here for seemingly no reason         great example of needlessly aggressive
  fucccccc so good
  ive got two threads up on the board right now i just dont post them with my trip these days because when i do it becomes a whole thing and antitripfag circlejerks are tiring
  great example of needlessly aggressive    how was that aggressive at all ac hasnt posted a thread in a long time    you should probably just stick to reddit if you cant handle the criticism here like did you actually think you were breaking new ground with these photos its been done a million times
    shit my bad i meant to click on  i love a good ac thread my mistake
  ac hasnt posted a thread in a long time    
      wait what did op just out himself as samefag    wtf am i reading
  holy shit are you the chosis of wildlife photography
  no the opposite im not the op i added my trip because it annoyed me earlier when i was supporting the guy and someone accused him of samefagging
    it seems to be a theme around here people just want to talk shit and dont actually give a fuck about photography the gear threads turn into a shouting match photo threads turn into a shouting match everything just turns into a big insult bonfire
  people started irrationally attacking him  im pretty sure it is just one troll who is thoroughly enjoying all the attention
  dunno there are 36 posters in this thread
    how do you see that information     im not the guy youre responding to but i also thought it was maybe 1 or 2 trolls just samefagging for attention
  its at the bottom right corner of the page for example at the time of this reply it says     93 / 14 / 36 / 1    which means    93 replies / 14 images / 36 posters / page 1
  there are also 94 replies it doesnt say who has posted what but the trolls themes are pretty consistent
  so youre saying that youre the troll    mystery solved
  posters vs actual human beings at keyboards isnt strictly 11 though at least two of those posters are me because i get on 4chan from both my phone and my laptop
  was the decision to focus on the feet instead of the head an artistic choice
  people started irrationally attacking  you mean constructive crit  op started getting belligerent when anons wouldnt jack him off
  you mean constructive crit  nope i mean irrationally attacking     first attack was bitching that he posted the same pic multiple times on instagram which was entirely unrelated to this thread second attack was calling his photos derivative which a is not really that constructive since it doesnt give any suggestions for how he could improve without getting mauled by a polar bear and b is barely bearly hahahah criticism its saying that his photos of an animal that most of us have never seen outside of a zoo look similar to other photos of that animal taken outside of a zoo theyre definitely not as one poster said exactly the same shots youd get in a zoo which is obvious to anyone whos actually tried to photograph a polar bear in a zoo and the assertion that theyre basically the pigeons of the north seems a little unlikely to me but if that guy really lived somewhere that polar bears were as common as idiots on /p/ i would invite him to post some of his polar bear snapshots in his own threadsurely if they were that common and if the ops shots are that run of the mill he must have taken a few polar bear pics that are as good or better     and even in the face of that he really didnt get belligerent he told one anon that he was acting like a child when he totally was and mostly just responded to the trolling with okay thanks for your input a lot of the posts in here that youre attributing to him are other people like me who are defending him because he did nothing wrong other than having the gall to post an interesting photo thread on what is ostensibly a board for photographers to share their work
    to be fair the photos arent actually that great
                  ive been looking at these and its mostly the bad post processing that stands out    too much dehaze and clarity sliders from the looks of it
  was this your first time shooting auroras
  at least they are photos and not gear wank and trolling
    see now this is an example of a comment thats negative for no reason other than negativity rather than give any sort of useful feedback do you not like the exposure is the focus soft color toning you chose to troll op with a negative comment that had no purpose other than trying to goad him into getting mad    a negative comment with no purpose beyond trying to illicit a negative response from someone is the literal definition of being a troll
  wtf are you on your period
    ha fuckin got him
  cant tell if this is nate or ac but either way fuck off with this whiny shit
  i am not trying to be negativeive read multiple books on night photography shooting aurora borealis specifically and op decided to throw away every rule multiple authors recommend so i was just wondering if there is a reason for it or if it was his first time stop projecting
    now to actually give some feedback on the photo at hand and believe me im no aurora expert    the composition is a little bit sloppy not awful but a little bit sloppy i see you shot this wide open dont do that i would have stopped down to probably f/8 or maybe even f/11 for this i might also have tried to shift the tone of the snow closer to white but thats a personal preference    mostly though you could have corrected a lot of this by a slightly longer exposure but stopped down    but again im no aurora expert
    saying that you would shoot an astro shot at f/11 really proves that youve never actually shot astro     aside from that the rest of your statement doesnt make any sense you dont like the composition or the color toning on the snow which is fine and fair feedback but then you say that he could have corrected that with a longer exposure and smaller aperture have you literally ever touched a camera before
  saying that you would shoot an astro shot at f/11 really proves that youve never actually shot astro     you are a moron the reason that i suggested stopping down is because the whole image is soft    back to class you fucking moron    ps ive shot plenty of astro
    literally nobody with half a fucking brain would shoot an astro shot at f/11 if you think the image is soft you would have suggested f/4 or maybe f/56 but f/11 is just absolutely retarded     also you never once said the photo was soft you said the composition was a little bit sloppy and you would have changed the toning on the snow once again neither of those would change with a smaller aperture     assuming  is also you id love to hear about   every rule multiple authors recommend   that op apparently decided to throw away
    here ya go fucknuts     if you ask any seasoned astrophotographer what they want the most out of a lens theyll usually say fast glass aperture is one of the most important things to consider when choosing a lens for astrophotography      set the lens to its widest opening usually f/28    now are you sure youve actually read a single article about shooting astro and are you sure youve shot plenty of astro
   cant tell if this is nate or ac  wasnt me but i agree with the sentiment      i would have stopped down to probably f/8 or maybe even f/11 for this  really    at f/28 he was at an 8 second exposure     that means at f/8 he would need a full minute exposure and f/11 would be two minutes thats not a slightly longer exposure        the reason that i suggested stopping down is because the whole image is soft  are you sure thats not just because its an aurora its hazy lights in the sky where particles are bouncing off the atmosphere so its wobbly and fluid    i feel like youd be hard pressed to find any guide on shooting astrophotography or the northern lights that recommends f/11 if youre going for anything other than star trails
  are you sure thats not just because its an aurora its hazy lights in the sky where particles are bouncing off the atmosphere so its wobbly and fluid    look a the foreground and the corners its all soft
  i think goober maybe had it on a tripod but pushed the shutter button by hand
  on second thought maybe the 1635 is just soft
  on second thought maybe the 1635 is just soft  wide open i bet it is
    you realize theres a difference between soft and motion blur right     most likely it looks soft because its a compressed jpg ran through another shitty compression algorithm on this website and yes very few lenses are super sharp wide open at 16mm     that said literally everything else you said was still absolute drivel and youre latching on to the one tiny thing you said that was only mostly wrong as opposed to completely stupid

get a roll of 35mm film developed   there are 39 images  wut
  if you dont load film poorly you should confidently get 38 shots per roll occasionally 39
  someone elses photos got mixed in or duplicates did you take more than 36 photos
    it is the same roll it just looks like the first 3 shots before the film counter started actually resulted in exposures
  youll get a slightly different amount of images because cameras are all a little different
learn to load film correctly and not waste a fuckton of frames in the leader and youll get 38exp easy    for a smaller camera that requires the film to be stretched a smaller distance across the back you can get 3940 i usually got 40 frames per roll in my xa cameras
i usually get around 9091 shots out of a roll of 135    beat that faggots
    my brother got 40 on a roll of b/w i deved for him recently
  one of the images are called a on the preview card and i dont remember taking it    wat
  depends of camera but not wasting the lead its possible to get significantly more shots than nominal per 35mm roll loading the camera in dark gives a bonus shot    also if too greedy its possible to get multiple exposure of everything on first frame and rest of film unexposed
  half frame scum
guys i accidentally shot a roll foma400 at iso100  my developer is hc100   what do 
  get a roll of 35mm film developed   there are 31 images  wut    the fuck went wrong here bros
is this expected level of noise for 60d
  depends on the iso which we cant see because you saved this in png for some reason which doesnt have exif data
  it is but it also depends on the lens fast/slow
  i dunno is it
  that a dudes hair needs conditioner    it all depends on iso
did you expose for the face did you shoot raw did you do any post processing other than save as a png youre shooting into the sun without a fill flash or even a reflector

  you should digitize them and put them on archiveorg i know nobody will ever read them there but they could be all that survives in the digital trail and you have the power to preserve them think of it as a work of charity
  speak for yourself id love to see more of them
  oh shit thats seriously vintage i scrolled past this thread earlier because i assumed it would just be like 1950stype stuff but this is from before the age of color     please do scan and upload
wow interesting the way advertisements and articles for the topic at hand never really change throughout history okay the graphical design did but what changes is simply the technology    had a chuckle at the little corner with the balopticon lantern projector how its compatible with any sort of high intensity light source but lined with asbestos yet still it wouldnt be out of place to see a modern photography and video magazine would also put ads for companies selling niche recording storage and playback mediums amongst articles for photography in general    a vintage motoring motorcycle/auto magazine would hardly differ in this respect      very nice shots although a shame about the tattered zines well for pieces from the 1900s it aint too bad  still id recommend using a regular scanner with high dpi setting and uploading them somewhere or setting up your d5600 in some sort of harness and placing the magazines under a glass platten glass slide    perhaps an advanced ocr software could deal with the text too
  please scan some more thanks op
    will spend this weekend scanning  pdfing them and will post the link here and onto archiveorg    glad people are interested
    will do
  will be using a scanner rather than just taking overhead shots
  why the hell would anyone throw away such old and rare magazines what the fuck these are great op itd be great if you uploaded more of them a fascinating window into photography a century ago
  as a historian i wholeheartedly thank you for this reply
  thank you this fascinates me i will be following this thread as long as possible
  perhaps an advanced ocr software could deal with the text too    btw this is the best free site that i know for ocr

    i like these a lot the rest have this somewhat oppressive tone that i cant get intoits almost certainly the colours the framing and contrast seem fine  cool seeing stuff like this here though gj

  its pretty cool to me that you mentioned oppressive as being the reason you couldnt get into a lot of these im a huge horror fan and i kind of like shooting stuff that feels a bit off or hopefully a little strange or even oppressive i know its not for everyone and its successful in varying degrees but i dont mind it being a throughline in my work    this is the first camgirl ive shot but she was actually a really good model and also just really fun to shoot with in general she had an awesome looking hotel room too    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce7rcamera softwarecapture one pro for sony 1021 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/20focal length 35mm equiv28 mmimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiexposure time1/160 secfnumberf/20exposure programmanualiso speed rating4000lens aperturef/20brightness29 evexposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourcecloudy weatherflashno flash compulsoryfocal length2800 mmimage width1000image height667renderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balancemanualscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal
this is from 2 weekends ago got a cabin upstate with the wife and another photographer and this model we all hang out and watch horror movies a lot it was raining all day and the rooms at the cabin we were staying at were kind of dreary and depressing so i pulled up some todd hido as inspo before i shot    this is the last of the stuff ive shot since the last time i posted ill prob post a couple more from the various sets as i reply though    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution1546 dpivertical resolution1546 dpi
oh shit inspo i forgot to mention im always looking for peoples favorite portrait photographers bonus points if they seem to align with my aesthetics at all but really im just looking for people doing some stuff off the beaten path that feels new and interesting
  how the hell do you even do this with the lighting what time was it when you shot
its really good see that /p/ actually have good photographers like you   i like almost all of the these amazing use of colors and lights love the punch of red yellow and blue       this photo is lame as fuck tho     love the use soft focus but het underwear color is kinda ruining the whole aesthetic     she look like hedi slimanes slp era models      most fav from the thread     also share your instagram
  funny enough you should ask because i basically never take setup photos but i actually took one of my light setup here it was shot in the afternoon blue light camera left filling the entire room small redish/pink light camera right at the end of the table adding highlights
man i would love to learn what techniques you use i feel like id shoot very different pictures from what you did but i also dont have nearly as much technical knowledge about lighting to get even near the pictures you posted    i would guess knowing where and when to shoot is a pretty great step into taking good pictures and id guess theres a bunch of other lighting apparatus behind the scenes to make it happen right      asumaray i think
newfag passing by  just wanted to let you know im in love with everything youre posting please stay and keep posting
  appreciate the feedback agree with the dude photo being pretty bad i dont remember the toning being this bad either i kind of want to reshoot with this dude anyway he had a pretty expressive face    instagram is

  thanks for posting this ive been looking more into shooting ever since ive dropped it last year i guess im too selfaware of my lack of experience and it just loops into not having motivation to shoot because of that lack of experience ill look into borrowing light cameras and maybe force myself to go out there and try shit out
  my setup is pretty ghetto desu but i value being able to throw everything i need into a backpack since im based in nyc the biggest thing with learning lighting is to just practice it a ton you can look at diagrams and setups all day but nothing is going to beat actually doing it you dont even need fancy lights just move lamps around and start putting stuff in front of them i know its super generic advice but its true    for actual lights i used to use a yongnuo yn360 led video light and another little shitty square video light with gels but ive moved to colorspikes though i got free product from them as part of a shoot i did for their kickstarter before they were even being produced yet attached photo was part of that same shoot      thanks desu im not on here very much but ill lurk occasionally    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce7rcamera softwareadobe photoshop cs6 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/18focal length 35mm equiv55 mmimagespecific propertiesimage width6490image height4332number of bits per component16 16 16compression schemeuncompressedpixel compositionrgbimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage data arrangementchunky formatimage created20171002 221919exposure time1/200 secfnumberf/18exposure programmanualiso speed rating1600lens aperturef/18brightness12 evexposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourcedaylightflashno flash compulsoryfocal length5500 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width1000image height667renderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balancemanualscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal

    neat i kinda found the same setup with a red shop light and l filled with a phone light obviously not as good but i really like the style i think ill try this again with proper lighting    gonna grab some video lights as well cant into flash for the life of me also iso speeds have become pretty insane so i feel like you can get away with not a lot of light
  what do you say to them
  classics      even with the iso speeds getting crazy having the option to light stuff will never be a bad thing      i keep it short and sweet ask if they would be interested in shooting if i have something particular in mind ill send a few inspo images dont write some long winded dm no one has time for that    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce7rcamera softwarecapture one pro for sony 1012 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/18focal length 35mm equiv55 mmimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiexposure time1/100 secfnumberf/18exposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating4000lens aperturef/18brightness15 evexposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length5500 mmimage width667image height1000renderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal

  been with my wife longer than ive been shooting portraits i know a decent chunk of photographers who end up dating models and people end up becoming friends/hanging out/hooking up sometimes but in general you never want to make any advances while your shooting thats how you get called out and when youre shooting sexy stuff most of the time youre so focused on the photos thats its not even an issue    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce7rcamera softwareadobe photoshop cs6 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/18focal length 35mm equiv55 mmimagespecific propertiesimage width4816image height7217number of bits per component16 16 16compression schemeuncompressedpixel compositionrgbimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage data arrangementchunky formatimage created20180401 120734exposure time1/80 secfnumberf/18exposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating6400lens aperturef/18brightness34 evexposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length5500 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width667image height1000renderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal

  how hard it is to make a living out of photography as a fashion/portrait photog
  got nothing to add but liking your work youre great with lighting and creating an atmosphere
  depends on how broad you want to go with portraits corporate headshots senior portraits if you just mean like fashion and branding portraiture its gonna be hard youre either going to need to be in a big city like nyc/la and claw your way through the competition or be big a big fish in a little pond but deal with the lack of large brands to shoot either way its not easy also theres no way in hell youll make a proper living doing it from the ground floor best case is you do it on the side until you build up a big enough portfolio and client base that you can quit your day job      thanks atmosphere is the main thing i aim for    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution1546 dpivertical resolution1546 dpi

    nick fancher looks right up your alley
  i love this keep it up
  happy to answer any questions or talk about portrait photography etc  how did u get so gud
  hiw did you do that ive once tried to light a face just with a stripe of light using cardboard in front of a strobe or permanent light and either had blurred edges or cardboard within the frame
  tfw almost started a portrait and headshot business years ago but chickened out  good job my guy still kind of sad i didnt
  im missing any kind of purpose here    well executed but the style is starting to feel very dated    this is just garbage the effect you were going for doesnt come through at all    i can see why people like it its a very in style that feels like cyberpunkgothwhatever that many people are starting to get back into with blade runner 2 and cyberpunk 2077 very well executed    im intrigued by the lighting in this one but the subject doesnt seem to add anything her expression is juxtaposed against this eerie yet serene background in an awkward way    very well executed model shot the red light in contrast with the olive looking skin was a good choice    everything you did right in your popular photo above you did wrong here    i like the photo generally but im disappointed with the model she doesnt speak with her eyes so it kind of deadens the photo    if you hadnt said anything about low light performance i wouldnt have noticed but since you did i see muddling in her skin doesnt take much away though its a good shot    yeah theres just nothing here    you say its a dud but i really like this one you do a fantastic job with your use of light as a framing mechanism this one is a good example of that you have an eye for color as well and when to apply it versus when to mute it    im getting nothing from this nothing intrigues me    im impressed with the dynamic range here although thats more technical i know theres good emotion here good shot    another example of what i was talking about above you lean heavily into these red/blue contrasts but you do it very well and although the coloring is heavy handed you know where to apply it to the best effect    this is terrible theres no inspiration here
  oppressive or not the yellow here is far too dense if it had been lighter and brighter perhaps so we could see the water more clearly this could have been better but overall it falls short    im seeing a lack of feeling here too it feels forced and inorganic

  good feedback thanks for taking the time to go through everything  youre welcome
  your photos are amazing do you shoot for any editorial stuff
  thanks    regardless of the lights and the girls being pretty the main thing that stands out is the way they seem at ease in front of the camera you the shots have an intimacy that seems genuine any sexualization appears to be given by the model not taken by the photographer    just remembered a documentary i saw a while back cameraman the life and work of jack cardiff skip to 10200 in to see his hobby portraits   embed    id be interested to hear about your film
    this one
like your photos especially this one   and i agree with him     one question do you use also a flash in addition to colored lights thank you
  sometimes ill submit sets i think are really good or work well as a set to online publications the photographic journal nakid etc but nothing actually really cool       i appreciate that a lot of times people kind of knock my sets because they say the models look a little uncomfortable but i like a little sense of melancholy/unease/etc in most of my shoots ill routinely tell models to stop being so posey when i shoot i prefer more organic seeming stuff as per nudity im always super upfront with getting the ok from the model and asking if shes comfortable each step of the way with anything even a bit risque i also pay attention when shooting and even if the model doesnt say anything but i can tell shes a little uncomfortable with a certain look or angle or whatever ill try and mix it up    in the end since most of the stuff i shoot is trade i value building good relationships with the people i shoot because hopefully down the road if i have a creative idea that i want to execute i have a bunch of people who are more than willing to help and go above and beyond photography/videography is a passion project of mine so in the end its about creating cool stuff and i try and do things in a way that enable me to create more and more cool stuff not that respecting your models should be a means to an end      i actually shot some nice video portraits that day too it was a weird low key shoot that was nice      i use purely continuous light but sometimes ill use normal white or tungsten light in addition to colored stuff in general i want to move away from the i just watched suspiria for the first time style of blasting colored lights at models since im getting fatigued on it and move to using colored light as accents or in a more subtle way    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce7rcamera softwareadobe photoshop cs6 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/18focal length 35mm equiv55 mmimagespecific propertiesimage width6236image height4162number of bits per component16 16 16compression schemeuncompressedpixel compositionrgbimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage data arrangementchunky formatimage created20180321 193122exposure time1/200 secfnumberf/18exposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating200lens aperturef/18brightness22 evexposure bias1 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length5500 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width1000image height667renderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal
you can totally make it and earn way more than programming have been following you for a while and also the photogs that follow you back are also really amazing
  this one is well executed but has that stock photo feel    this one is technically good as well but the style is very generic and been done to death thats not a problem if youre just starting out and want to get the basics down first but it looks like youve been doing it for a while    just awful even if it wasnt soft focus or you used the 1/4 the light and the composition would still be bad              le streak of light on the face  please stop the last three sort of work just because of how good looking the model is and because shes good at posing but please just stop doing this meme    nice but the expression of the model and the lights would work better with a more gritty and sort of dirty background and props    i like this but the fact that its not straight triggers my autism    this one works i dont even know why    this one is good    this one somehow manages to be worse than     really good stuff    good use of colors and lights      just pointless and uninspired                  i like these dont really like the rest but too lazy to type it all out
  bump
  im in love with this shot ignore my basic question but do you have any photo platform where you share the work
your work has not evolved or changed in like 4 years  yikes
  this youre back for your usual onceayear thread to appeal to the newfags that havent seen it all before    youre not awful but youre also stagnant with zero desire to improve or develop additional eye for a personal style youre just a gimp that finds a trend and sticks to it     if you focused less on appealing to popular trends from 2012 and focused more on your own artistic vision maybe this would change    heres my feedback  uninstall instagram and other social media platforms you follow photographers through stop seeking out people to artificially inflate your ego with like4like follow4follow behavior     start thinking about messages and narratives not just aesthetics and mood    dont come back to /p/ once a year to say youll looking for criticism when what youre really looking for is easy praise from a board that tends to be overpopulated by people still learning their way around their first camera and thus easily impressed by any external lightwork

how many times a week do we have to have this exact same thread     delete this and post it in /gear/
  /gear/  gear doesnt know anything about cameras though    noted thats what i remember hearing a lot 5 years ago or so when i started as well i was wondering if it was still the goto entry level camera   i dont know if they actually want something that large though since theyre just starting and theyre going to be traveling a lot so if people have mirrorless suggestions as well lmk
  depends on what you value    portability   point and shoot like rx100 ii    mirrorless portability  interchangeable lens  save up 100 and get a6000    fits your budget  rebel like others have said sl1 or sl2 are the smaller models to be easier for travel
used em5 and the 40150/1242 ibis is nice for video
  nikon d3300 i guess its now the 3400 but if you can find some retailer who still has the 3300 its a bit better than its replacement
  canon eos 40d efs 1855 is yongnuo 35mm f/20
  second hand rx100
  samsung nx1 pretty sure you can snag a used one for about 300 greens
  d7000
  i wish entry level cameras came with a 50mm like back in the day
  samsung nx1 pretty sure you can snag a used one for about 300 greens  maybe 1300
spend a little more and get the original x100  its fun to shoot with and easy to learn on and its image quality is good enough
if they dont want to get into lenses i was impressed with power shots from back in the day dont know if they have stood the test of time
  why have one good sensor when you can have 16 shitty ones this is like amd with cores    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpicolor space informationsrgbimage width800image height1012scene capture typestandard
  its a render of a concept dipshit read the subtitle before making a shitty post
its like when phones started having 2 cameras to do fake depth of field its a cool gimmick theyre off set to allow you to scan objects to create a 3d model
  you understand that you cant fit a good sensor in a phone right if you did it would have to be as thick as an actual camera thats just how optics work unless we can figure out a way to make optics work significantly differently youre never going to get a good sensor in a cellphone     so what you do is combine a bunch of shitty ones so that they can all work together and their various shittinesses cancel out eg noise is random so if you have multiple different sensors looking at the same image you can figure out which pixels are giving an accurate reading and which are just noise     its really pretty clever
  the first functioning movie camera had 16 lenses leprince this is a great idea actually
  so phone cameras are 132 years behind

  the first kodak digital slr was also shit that doesnt mean all digital cameras that followed it were a mistake

  cant fit one larger sensor in a phone   plenty of room for 16 small shitty ones   yeah alright that makes sense why didnt i think of that have you not seen some of these tiny point and shoots with far better optics than any phone on the market with all that retarded space they are using for 16 sensors and lenses they could easily have a 1 inch in there with out the meme factor pic related and smaller than that abomination

  you get a thicc phone with a big sensor
  thicc phone  absolutely nothing wrong with that
  from a review linked on panasonics page for that camera  like other heavily cameracentric mobile phones the panasonic cm1 is not remotely thin or light its 152mm thick blooming out to 211mm by the camera lens  compare 79mm for the latest iphone and about 84 for the latest samsung its small for a camera but its bulky for a phone also heavier and significantly more expensive than similar phones without the big sensor     additionally one big sensor misses out on some of the cool features you can do with several small sensors eg  1 depth mapping and afterthefact depth of field adjustments/3d effects that come with that  2 multiple available focal lengths the panasonic you posted is fixed 28mmequivalent  3 have different sensors designed for different things like have one monochrome sensor thats much better in low light paired with a standard bayer sensor for the color information to overlay on top     and the way chip prices scale you can throw in a bunch of different camera modules for less than the price of one good one
  i like that you try to show the quality of a photo taken from a special smartphone using an image of extreme shit qualit
  im not buying either of these retarded things but if i was going to be an epic memer with a special purpose smart phone camera i would pick the one with a larger sensor not rely on some magic af system thats just going to break and still look like shit     your english is extreme shit qualit looks good on my machine

it may be propaganda but at the same time its a magazine that does reportage  wether people like it or not there has been an increase in racial diversity in all urban areas you dont have to like a photo of a muslim girl in a trampoline but its a reflection of todays daily life in some areas of the world and it may be worth documenting for posteriority today it may seem annoying virtue signaling or whatever but its something we can revisit later on thanks to documenting practices like photography    its also a reflection of the consumer base imo kids today think zoomers and younger are pretty wholesome in a way that id have laughed and thought of as not authentic back in my day when i was their age    regarding the skill or artistic merit a person who found a theme and subject and decided to make a whole set based on it has is way beyond from someone who is still at the tier of shooting anything and getting alright looking pictures  for those who might argue with that point choose any subject you like then go out and take pictures about it then choose from those the ones you think make for a good set accomplish it in a short timeframe depending on subject a day week month youll see its not that easy and requires work like people that say things like a kid could have painted that right but the kid didnt

  its not the fact that theyre covering nonwhite people thats not what im saying im saying the images are objectively shit and they have no place in the images of the year for natgeo except for a virtue signaling
  that media australian bought it out and quality dropped
holy fuck theres tilted horizons in nat geo now
subject matterexecution    change my mind
  youve literally never opened a natgeo in your life have you
  ok fine but then the subject matter needs to be something truly rare not just look at this black lady/landscape/animal
  subject matter needs to be something truly rare not just look at this black lady/landscape/animal  national geographic  what are you fucking retarded
most of these photos are just antiwhite and islamophilic propaganda
  most of these comments are just white nationalist islamophobic racism
  sorry buddy i dont play your identity politics bullshit
that picture with the face that was literally cut off
  these national geographic photos dont feature white people so theyre antiwhite  but i dont practice identity politics
  this
  were saying the photos are shit what reason would this photo  or this photo  have to be considered one of the best photos of the entire year i cant see anything interesting about it or good composition theyre snapshits
this is just pure propaganda
  fuck were legitimately spiraling london loved muslims and now theyre the acid attack capital of the world and have a higher murder rate than nyc
  murder rate was slightly higher one month for the year as a whole london was around 12 murders per 100k vs 34 for nyc and both cities crime rates are down overall and have been declining steadily for years despite immigrants settling in both cities     you are being lied to by conservative media to get you irrationally angry and keep you hooked on being irrationally angry and watching their programming to keep that irrational anger up break free and think for yourself most muslims just want to be left the hell alone to live their lives peacefully just like whites people
  point me one good wildlife shot fucking 500pxs daily lists offers better or at the very least just as good wildlife photography rip editorial photography indeed
  exactly what i thought shitty photos put in not by merit but to fill the quota they are not even trying to do a good shoot
    literally the second photo
  the ethnic people in natgeo used to be dressed in loin cloths and had their picture in the magazine because they were interesting looking natgeo used to be about exploration not pandering
  most muslims just want to be left the hell alone to live their lives peacefully just like whites people    if they didnt they wouldnt keep filling into white countries you cant invade someones house and then just go i just want to be left alone no mate you forced yourself on me
  youre really naive and/or american if you think their goal is to invade white countries and not just rich countries    if that were the case theyd be invading russia ukraine georgia czech republic iceland etc    they dont give a fuck man theyre just chasing opportunities or fleeing war like humans have always done
  as it happens white countries are the rich countries the point was we didnt move next to muslims they came to us theyre not taking the risk we are so dont talk to me about just being left in peace when you travel across the world to live next to me    you know what humans have alsl done for 99 of history massacred the foreign invaders to their land still want to appeal to what was done in the past

wow a black girl graduating wtf i love niggers now
  theres a difference between a dutch angle and a shot thats 1degree titled unintentionally many of these are unintentional and show a lack of giving a shit
  ive been looking at black tddies in natgeo for like 30 years now its nothing new anon
  see but tribes are interesting a black girl graduating high school lesbian women and a womens college kids jumping in an inflatable house these arent deserving of any recognition and you can tell theyre just virtue signaling the photos get better as you scroll down the list and not only are they better theyre devoid of ideological motivation just good photos
  whats it like being a shitskin
anyone ever run into camera companies making noncamera products  excluding sony    get a job as a science teacher at a richish school district   they have fucking leica microscopes  like fucking dozens of them  as far as i know the cheapest leica microscope is still like 500 and i dont think they were the basic model    the district i work in now has much better kids and pays better but fucking red dot microscopes
yeah or those idiots with their olympus microscopes or nikon binoculars or leica remote sensing units or zeiss photolithography gear its crazy its like companies that specialise in manufacturing optical equipment manufacture optical equipment that you specifically do not often use weird
lieca is known for making some of the best microscopes in the industry if i am not mistaken
ive seen zeiss ski goggles before
  why do high school students need fucking leica microscopes
  to be honest standard optical microscopes like you get in schools have been pretty much diffraction limited for decades yes there are advances in fluorescence microscopy and microholography all sorts of weird innovations but the basic setup of normal light going through normal lenses has been solved in a way that photography optics have not     that said quality microscopes like leicas still resolve marginally better but more than that theyre easier and much more pleasant to use i had the sad experience of being shown around a university in the developing world last year where they had labs outfitted with some kind of russian microscopes the absolute nightmare was that the exit pupil was tiny making it almost impossible to get your eye lined up in the one minuscule spot that would see an image at all     sure the image quality was pretty good when i could see it but trying to see anything at all was massively frustrating that would be a major downer for students who are getting their first experience using a microscope and have younger more flexible irises than i do trying to look through an optic than has a smaller exit pupil than the entrance pupil of your eye is hell on earth     conversely microscopes are built like tanks so they last a long time and the technology is not advancing fast it makes very good sense for a school to buy quality equipment that the kids will find easy to use theyll enjoy it more and the teachers can handle the class much better as they dont have to give personalised assistance to each of their students     cost sure maybe theyre spending the better part of a grand on each unit but its good for many students each year and a service life of many years it might work out to a couple of bucks per kid and thats good value
wew
  because fuck you were rich
  because american schools are paid for by property taxes in the school district which means schools in rich neighborhoods have stupid amounts of extra money while kids in poor neighborhoods dont get textbooks so get a shitty education and cant get out of their poor neighborhoods
worked with zeiss olympus and leica microscopes before i got into photography the clear view of the leica mz6 made it a joy to use
actually leica is one of the few who still make basic microscopes thats not just plastic junk pretty sure nikon/olympus dont even make anything entry level now
when i worked in a lab we used leica and olympus optical microscopes for sample prep they were both nice microscopes and about equal the electron microscopes and other stuff was mostly not any recognizable brands but we also had a zeiss xray diffractometer      im not so sure that a leica microscope would cost much more than any other brand theyre not some special boutique brand theyre just another microscope company by the way leica camera and leica microsystems are unrelated companies they just share a brand name and the red dot logo
  nikon unrionically makes rifle scopes
  yea that makes sense why should your taxes go to educate poor people honestly poors shouldnt even be allowed in school
  so does leica     get a leica for my ar so i can style when shooting
  tfw no leica brand scope
  partly true but another major source of money besides taxes is parentteacher organizations even if taxes get partly redistributed from wealthier neighborhoods to poorer ones rich parents have lots of money left over to donate directly to their neighborhood schools and rich housewives have lots of spare time to volunteer at the schools
  is that what a red dot site is
  zeiss too its all just optics

  by the way leica camera and leica microsystems are unrelated companies they just share a brand name and the red dot logo    i mean that is only partially true theyre all owned by leitz
  sony isnt a camera company cameras are at the bottom end of the list of consumer electronics they make

  fuji make more money from their astalift cosmetics line than their camera division
  do you have a source on that fuji doesnt break out its cosmetics revenue in its quarterly report which it seems like they would do if it were bigger than their entire camera division
  the camera branch is actually vital to sony  they just announced a few months ago they would invest 9 billion usd into the alpha7 / alpha9 program  9 000 000 000 usd  we can only speculate its related to their new organic sensor technology or expanding their lens manufacturing    it was the camera branch which gave birth to their most important assets to this date their semiconductor branch which has become even more important than their banking and their games branch  they sheer budget they are pouring into the camera branch is enough to make even canon envious
  9 billion rd budget    the a7iv is going to be really something
  bleeding edge tech is always a let down hold out for the a7v
  haha you must be kidding sensor development has nothing to do with a7 line in fact theyre downsizing on their cam manufacturing
  organic sensor  woah woah woah wait hold the fuck up sauce me bruv
  thats 9 billion to develop sensors for the ff line that also includes camcorders like venice etc  the company aims for the crown in the digital camera market
  no theyre downsizing their camera sensor sales market this was a long term plan    1 get everyone reliant on sony sensors  2 keep back the best sensors to show sony are that far ahead  3 once e mount is dominant limit purchases from other companies  4 other companies scream internally as they are now miles behind sony and will have to invest billions and billions on new patents new rd new fab plants etc which no company other than sony can afford samsung arent gonna jump back in after packing up a few years back panasonic are still on cd focus towerjazz and sunny still havent managed to produce a ff wafer canon dont sell   5 sony wins like a boss
  youre being fanboy theyre making more cash from selling sensors around than with their own camera program and its not going to change if anything theyll try to double down on third party with competition coming from panasonic and samsung
  3 once e mount is dominant limit purchases from other companies  i think thats grounds for lawsuit      theyre making more cash from selling sensors around  only if you combine nikon panasonic olympus fujifilm into one  sony semiconductors biggest camera customer is sony
  do you have a source on that because everything ive seen describes it simply as mostly image sensors and ff consumer cameras are kind of a sideshow to the bulk of the sensor business
  sony 1 sensor maker in world  sony 1 ff camera maker in world    sony needs to sell sensors    haha stupid american boy      private company refusing a private sale  lawsuit    haha you americans so funny  you can not fix all your problem with lawyer sometimes you need to be smart instead
  they were not talking about smartphones    they were talking in context of dealing with canikon     to put this into context this allowance money is 62 times bigger than annual revenue of canons camera division
  so fucking what why would i want my property taxes to go to a school that wouldnt benefit my kids the reason you move to an area that has good schools is to have your kids get a good education not so you can let the kids on the other side of the city have one if they are so concerned with their kids getting a good education protip they arent then they can get an apartment near a good school
  if youre desperately poor just move somewhere where property values and rent are vastly higher  yeah i wonder why people making around 1000/month total dont just move somewhere where rent starts at 1000/month its such a simple obvious and workable solution to the poverty problem
  imagine being this kind of fanboy dude sony doesent care a shit about you
  nikultists and fujipajeets getting toasty
  nikon makes godtier rifle scopes
  i tip my hat to your reference to the opening of classic 1990 action movie navy seals featuring charlie sheen
  sony does a care shit about me they pay my wage
  it wouldnt make sense for sony to stop selling imaging chips to other camera companies doing so wouldnt make all other camera companies disappear and if it did there would be serious antitrust implications so would just create a market vacuum for some other company to take that market share in fact even just treating its sensor customers badly would create that market vacuum it would take someone else a little time to catch up but theyd get there     there will always be people who want to buy something other than a sony camera by continuing to sell sensors to their competitors sony gets a piece of all of those antisony sales
  youre hearing what you want to hear and so are the rumor sites do you have an actual primary source saying that theyre going to spend 9 billion on specifically full frame because saying that theyre going to spend 150 of the entire divisions revenue on a lowprofit niche product doesnt pass the smell test the profitable professional cine cameras arent full frame
  hes being idiot nothing else nobody will invest 9bil in a shrinking segment thats bringing them few hundred million a year what they are investing is whole sensor department the main goal for it is machine vision thats the big one everyone is seeing this as a huge market and rightfully so everything from industrial robots to autonomous vehicles will use them and only the best and cheapest will do will something drop down to consumer camera department sure but its way down on the priority list way after phone sensors and even video sensors
        imagine being this angry at sony for investing in the future of digital photography
  dumb sonygger
  olympus has some of the best boroscopes out there
  sony makes glorious cameras and best console and best tvs and best cd players and best blueray players and best dvd players and best walkmen and best music and best movies and best spidermen movies and best cell phones

  the main goal for it is machine vision thats the big one  why are you being this much of a retard anon  machine vision sensors dont even have good dynamic range and backside illumination  let me fix this for you  will something drop down to machine vision sensor department sure but its way down on the priority list way after phone sensors and even video sensors    come on dude use your braincells spec comparisons is some of the easiest shit in this topic even casualfags are better at spec comparison than you are
  poors dont deserve happiness or nice things
  what are you even trying to say you must be on some pills or something youre not making slightest sense
  machine vision just need global shutter and hishspeed readout  sony already has that shit in their pregius lineup    im saying youre ignorant and doesnt realise your fancy robot sensors use handmedowns from the camera sensors
  the profitable professional cine cameras arent full frame  
  thats just logical deduction there is nothing else in an camera that needs 9 billion dollars to research than the sensor    sometimes they do invent fancy things like filter glass that has variable antimoire depending on how much voltage you send trough the glass  or filter glass that has variable nd that is also voltage variable and is seamless/stepless  but that shit doesnt take 9 billion only sensors cost this much
not a cameracomoany but i find it great that yamaha makes both motorcycles and musical instruments    like thats a segue if i ever saw one
  you are wrong there many different fields in machine vision each with specific needs youre awfully naive thinking smallest sensor market share is being prioritised over larger ones
  see this   thats what is available for machine vision their largest sensor is apsc  only the starvis sensors have backside illumination this technology was initially developed for consumer products and was later trickled down to the industry  the massive bulk you see is pregius sensors these are fontside illumination and the only special thing they have right now is global shutter  none of them are multiple layer stacked sensors    youre awfully naive thinking smallest sensor market share is being prioritised over larger ones  i can only say what i have observed    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwaregimp 242imagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution256 dpivertical resolution256 dpicommentpaint tool sai jpeg encoder v100
  this is stuff on market right now whats invested in is a decade and more in the future often with emerging and potential markets calculated in
  this is stuff on market right now  you can analyze the technology they use and determine where does it originate from    my argument is the starvis is exmor r it is using technology that was initially developed for consumer cameras  these sensors for industry does not need the newest and most expensive technologies    think about it  you want profit maximized  front side illumination is cheaper to manufacture  backside illumination is more advanced but more costly  so you develop 1 key technology such as global shutter which is necessary for optimal machine vision  then you locked that key technology into the cheapest manufacturing you can get away with in this case probably 180nm fsi manufacturing you have a shit load of 180nm capacity which is no longer used by your a7iii models so why not keep them in use for other businesses  and bamm suddenly you can price these 180nm sensors for insanely high pricing because they have that one key technology global shutter  thats how you get maximum profit finding out ways to use even your most mature technologies
  quality microscopes like leicas still resolve marginally better    it all depends on the objectives and condenser guaranteed that most schools are using bog standard possibly plan 4x/10 10x/25 40x/65 and oil 100x/125 with abbe condensers why the 100x oil is so common makes no sense as using immersion oil is a pain in the ass and lower powers are more satisfying    ive got a nicer leica but my nikons shit all over it but they should as theyre from nikons higher range even the chinese make some decent ones these days that beat my leica both are diffraction limited but the amscope has better flatness even though i wouldnt touch an amscope for personal use but even then it absolutely makes sense for schools to buy from the big makers as you point out as the build quality is better got an olympus thats 50 years old that still performs well though to be fair even the top brands can fail here eg leica delamination in some apochromats and nikon gear failures     as for a poor exit pupil thats usually the result of bad eyepiece selection doubt your issue was because of it being russian never heard anything bad about russian lomos but theyre not popular here in the us for students ive found the regular 10x/18 to be the best ive got  10x/26s and 15x26s which can provide spectacular views but overall theyre not as userfriendly

  thats not how its working youre overthinking things on the consumer side its always the other way around tech end under which semiconductor segment falls is not doing adaptations for the end use of the product theyre just developing and optimising their manufacturing techniques so theyre usefully and profitable for various end consumer they do this completely independently from demands of any in or out of the house consumer they only strive for maximum adaptability and profitability of their product when they have these things perfected and ready for consumer theyll offer them in various packages off the shelf stuff is cheapest and goes to anyone willing to pay the price some customers may input certain perimeters of their own into production process so they get slightly optimised products
  you can start by explaining why pregious is still frontside illumination    i gave a very good explanation already
  does it do 4k
  its better for the market its in price and features matter back lit sensors were developed for phone cams they dont bring anything meaningful for the larger sensors but they are a nice marketing ploy nonetheless you can bet that autonomous cars will need good low light performance that is the future market you fail to gasp all thats currently on the market is old technology very old in camera business actually panasonic first announced organic sensors in 2013 it was patented nearly a decade previously and is only now seeing light in consumer tech 8k video cam is the first announced product that will use it and its still at least a year from seeing daylight its not even clear jet if s1r will use it  what money invested in now will bring is too far in the future to predict for anyone but you can be sure that its not investment made in view of camera market one look at profits will tell you that
  its better for the market its in price and features matter  so youre using my argument and conceded that machine vision use handmedowns from the consumer market    what are we even arguing anymore seeing as you are only disagreeing for the sake of disagreeing
  youre arguing investments into future technologies based on current technology im explaining to you how dumb that sounds and you somehow believe youve won the argument go back to your wifus on /a/ youve no place here
  youre arguing investments into future technologies based on current technology  why does machine vision need future technology when old frontside illumination suits it better
  autonomous cars will need good low light performance that is the future market
  thats starvis they have backside illumination for cars and surveillance    but thats also old technology that was introduced in consumer cameras long before it was introduced in surveillance cameras  so the same question applies if they dont even need stacked layered sensors why the heck would the upcoming technology
why the heck would they need upcoming technology
  why are you still assuming this tech has anything to do with future investments ive never said it does it has nothing to do with was in development twenty years ago i told you already to look at market shares and projected markets and just use plain logic and youll realize where you stand
  why are you still assuming this tech has anything to do with future investments  what do you even refer to when you say this    the original article said sony invested 9 billion to destroy canon leadership  then you moaned something about machine vision  then i had to point out machine vision only use old technology  and now youre asking nonsense questions    can you just admit you were wrong from the beginning
  you continue to err there is nothing in initial article that specificity canon or even sonys own camera department youre a blind fanboy that has somehow come to conclusion that it will effect your beloveds companies camera technology   that someone would be that kind of utter cuck is beyond me if they come with something spectacular fine well jump ships or itll drop the prices of the competition its nothing personal to me but honestly theres nothing to look forward to panasonic has everything youll ever wish from sony right around the corner organic sensor global shutter you continue to be anime and sony fancuck i and every sane man will look at whats best and go there
  im guessing youre upset at the prospect of sony beating panasonic to the punch with organic sensor technology thats understandable since youre on that team    there is nothing in initial article that specificity canon   but this is outright wrong the statements of investing loads of money and beating canon in the market is connected  there is absolutely no reason to doubt the article like the way you did with your machine vision nonsense
  you continue to err  silence blackguard why i would run you through with my trusty sabre but i am loath to defile the weapon with the blood of a cad of the first water such as yourself take it back sir take back your scurrilous slander that i may have erred or as god is my witness you shall be as stubble to my sword
  yes but only with a huge crop
  im surprised no one has mentioned canons masterpiece the calculator mouse
  i dont own a single panasonic product its just fact is that panasonic has beaten sony in sensor development its got organic sensor ready for consumer market i can imagine how that makes you feel seeing this kind of defence youre showing nevertheless its not the reason for investement you are mentioning what ive been telling you all the time and what youre completely ignorant of is that semiconductor sensors are a big segment and consumer camera are a tinny proportion of it   aptina canon cmosis  omni vision technologies on semiconductor corporation samsung sony stm teledyne dalsa toshiba  all these companies are involved in it how many of them are making digital cameras its big business dont be a fool and think your camera has a large role in it its byproduct
  its actually the industry sensors that are the byproduct  new sensor technologies are used in consumer products first i already demonstrated this  then they trickle down to the industry  thats the definition of byproduct    its got organic sensor ready for consumer market  one one is believing in you and the reason for this is because their sensor isnt ready for release in the new ff camera
  its actually the industry sensors that are the byproduct  you couldnt be farther from the truth    automotive  transportation is one of the fastest growing markets for image sensor due to the increasing purchasing power of the millennial population there is a continuous demand for passenger cars according to oica global passenger was estimated to be 7210 million units in 2016 and the demand is expected to be continue during the forecast period  moreover applications such as safetyrelated imaging technologies and driverassistance applications are becoming more mainstream these include cameraenabled systems used for capturing a 360degree surround view in addition to enabling functions such as lane departure warning and autonomous driving in a broader perspective image sensors are currently undergoing a transition from the traditional approach of production to a more pragmatic technologicallyadvanced approach that ensures miniaturization and enhanced capabilities autonomous cars are expected to hit the commercial market by the end of 2018 dynamics of this kind are influencing the image sensor market growth globally the future of image sensors growth is acute to rise of global car fleet in addition the automobile industry globally is flourishing and it is expected that the total number of vehicles in the world could double to 25 billion by 2050    one one is believing in you and the reason for this is because their sensor isnt ready for release in the new ff camera  lol and what is this then  
  you couldnt be farther from the truth  and yet you can do nothing but agree with me the industry sensors all use old technology    whats up with that    lol and what is this then  nice ill concede that point to you at least
    they sell quite a few scientific instruments and suopplies pic related is a microtome
i saw this thing for sale near me a while ago its used to check the profile of gears and whatnot
    we use olympus microscopes in the lab

  a friend of mine works on a nikon machine that makes computer chips
  i have seen pentax contact lenses and my uni lab had olympus and zeiss microscopes  but zeiss doesnt count i guess they are a optics company not a camera company   leica on the other hand has camera in the name
i dont have my pic handy right now but nikon also makes periscopes for japanese submarines
  leica have tons of civil enginer tools too not talking about the military ones    its their real niche a good land surveyor goes from 1015k
  yeah but as mentioned previously in the thread it now has nothing to do with the camera company
  i have a ricoh watch my friend bought me for my birthday from a indian ebay seller shit looks modified as fuck and doesnt even work lol
pentax red dot sights
  who doesnt know leica makes microscopes    i thought it was funny that the tax collectors office used a canon efs lens on an industrial camera for the photo ids
  i mean desu leica was making microscopes before they were making cameras the real question is does anyone ever run into microscope companies making nonmicroscope products
  the real question is does anyone ever run into microscope companies making nonmicroscope products    every microscope manufacturer i know makes 100s of other products as well
  leica as a luxury brand sells merch like watches headphones bags and rebadges phone camera lenses
  actually looking at prices theyre not even that high end as youd expect there are more expensive stuff on the market and some shit tier level stuff
  yeah i mean jamal and deshanequa need their leicas too
  yeah but who gives a shit its not like canon has to tell its workers ok jim thats enough 5ds for today we need you to screw 350 bubble jets together same name same logo
  zeiss makes some vision correction laser machines
  honestly the vast majority of camera companies produce other optical instruments or completely different products name me one that is only producing cameras and lenses
  and rightly so here in the netherlands we pay to give immigrants extra individual care and neglect our own children       kek
  camera companies making noncamera products  ernst leitz was making microscopes decades before they even made their very first camera prototype
  it still revolves around the optics i feel it would be more of a waste if they woulndt use their resources this way
okay so i was a moron and dropped my d7000 the other day for the most part it seems to be fine except for the minor detail that the autofocus isnt working    ive taken out and replaced the battery done a factory reset tried correcting with the af fine tune and its still fucked doesnt matter what lens i put on it and it seems to work fine in live view so i assume its the phase detect af system thats the problem     is this something i can get fixed given these cameras are currently going on ebay for about 200 would a fix even be economical or am i in fuck it just get a new one territory
  the mirror probably went out of alignment or in the worst case the af sensor repairs might cost more than a replacement camera body
  bummer just checked the shutter count and its still only at 20k
  accidents happen anon to minimize risks i always suggest wear a camera strap you can send the camera to an independent repair shop in your area dont send it to a nikon official because they fucking suck at life and overcharge you for shit that didnt matter    if the repair costs are close that of a new camera get a new camera instead
  dslrs can take a huge amount of abuse  its probably a problem with the secondary mirror only of the few more fragile elements    lift the main mirror up with your fingers and see if the secondary mirror is still in place and undamaged    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cs5 windowsimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage created20120819 124024color space informationuncalibratedimage width437image height445
  given these cameras are currently going on ebay for about 200  damn i knew i should have bought the d7000 instead of the d3200 but i was afraid to to buy on ebay and i wanted store warranty even if only for 6 months and now im stuck with a camera without focus motor weather sealing and no measuring noncpu lens  its not that im going to buy a lens anytime soon due to financial reasons but when i do im going to regret not having bought a d7000 instead
  save up some money and get a d7000 later on anon d3200 is not a waste the purpose of this camera is either hobby use or teach you using dslr machines
  but then i would have two cameras and i only need one i doubt i can sell it since there are many of those cameras around if in the future i wanted to work professionally then it would make sense to have a backup camera but i dont think that will be the case
op here    re use a strap  i normally have the camera on a black rapid but was being lazy i refer to my previous assertion that i am an imbecile    re take it to an indy repair shop  already done dropped it off at a local independent repair store who i ha e already received excellent service from in regards a stuck zoom ring on my sigma 1750 28 theyre having a look at it and will give me a noobligation quote with an initial estimate in the 100 ballpark    re but then i would have two cameras when i only need one  im currently falling back on my old d3200 while my d7000 is at the repair shop so i can attest that having two cameras is no bad thing
smack it again from the opposite side worked well with my canon

  if you didnt compress the file so much there wouldnt be artefacts  try saving at 88 quality and resizing to the resolution of your preferred viewing device eg 1920px on the long side

frame is being broken  picture is blurry need a faster shutter speed  dont do manual settings if you dont know how yet use aperture priority shutter priority etc  poor lighting  no color palette
    also your cropping is all bad if your background is not interesting dont include the background make it closer to the person
  it was night time only using the natural night lights i also love low aperture  as for some of the blurs i get it but once zoomed out or viewed on a phone its not that bad  i didnt tweak anything besides the basic raw sliders in photoshop
  you can love aperture priority all you want but i think your way of thinking is a detriment to your progress    here are my suggestions  dont be afraid of flash at night it can be used to great effect especially with a slow shutter release google flash photography at night  shake is a problem here either use a tripod or pick better locations with more available light that is if and when youre not up for using flash the only alternative is to get a faster lens a new body with better iso perforamnce or with ibis   you definitely need to work on your compositions be mindful of the backgrounds and where you are placing your model getting into the mindset that it_just_doesnt_matter because its blurred out is a particularly bad habbit   try shooting these in spot so that the camera can create a bigger divide between subject and background spot is usually the best one to go with for portaits as it is the majority of them are big mushes of orange and bokeh at the very least learn to experiment with it     i just got to ask why are all these shot at 07 ev did you just fuck around with the camera one day and forgot you did
  once zoomed out or viewed on a phone its not that bad  if you post fullfuckingresolution images on the board expect them to be criticized by people looking at them at 100 just one of the many reasons to resize your photos before posting
  bad habit im kinda new i only really recently even started using raw before that i was photographing my girlfriend who had tan skin and for some reason thats the value she looked decent on   i think i do need a better camera this old 500d is halfway broken as it is although i do know that equipment does not make the photographer but i sure could use something that performs better in low light and has better focus features such as face detection    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makecanoncamera modelcanon eos 500dfirmware versionfirmware version 111serial number1180554737lens nameef50mm f/18 stmimagespecific propertiesimage orientationrighthand tophorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage created20180816 170918exposure time1/1000 secfnumberf/18exposure programaperture prioritylens aperturef/18exposure bias1 evflashno flash compulsoryfocal length5000 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width4752image height3168renderingnormalexposure modeauto bracketscene capture typestandardexposure modeavpriorityfocus typeautometering modeevaluativeiso speed ratingautosharpnessunknownsaturationnormalcontrastnormalshooting modemanualimage sizelargefocus modeai focusdrive modesingleflash modeoffcompression settingfinemacro modenormalwhite balanceautoexposure compensation2sensor iso speed160color matrix129

  oh also i really dont want to fuss with flash there were times when ive used some cheap bicycle lamps i wonder if theres something cheaper thats handheld and performs similarly some kind of rgb led panel thats easy to just hold in a hand  either way it wasnt a professional shoot im not bringing a tripod on a date  i do love the low aperture because it leaves more up to the imagination but especially in that dark i couldnt really get away with increasing it    i just carry my camera usually i dont really have anything else    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makecanoncamera modelcanon eos 500dcamera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2015 windowsimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage created20181115 042357exposure time1/640 secfnumberf/18exposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating100lens aperturef/18exposure bias1/3 evmetering modepatternflashno flash compulsoryfocal length5000 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width3168image height4752renderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandard
  i dont really have anything else  ahhh the good ole natural light only lol    this model is a qt too bad u missed focus on both are you using autofocus or what
  oh also i really dont want to fuss with flash  what i was trying to get at is a technique called slow sync flash in which you fire the flash but do a long exposure slow shutter in order to capture the background some cameras even have a night portrait mode on the dial im not sure if the 500d has one that do just that     either way it wasnt a professional shoot im not bringing a tripod on a date  a date on which you took at least 10 photos  of your subject if i had to wager a guess she didnt call you ever again just kidding ww    but in all seriousness in such cases you just need to pick better locations for your snaps put your model in light so that it doesnt compete with all the shit in the background you want the subject to be the brightest and most important part of your photograph its as easy as moving them away or toward something be aware of where the light is coming from at your location so that you can situate them where the light will hit their face and such     something cheaper thats handheld and performs similarly some kind of rgb led panel  no need to fuss with any of that just get a proper flash for your system the inbody flash works quite well though for such purposes these led panels are usually reserved for video shooting in which constant light is the main priority

                      learn to resize dipshit youre clogging hiroshimoots servers with your turds delete them and read a book about the basics of photography shits blurry wack lighting and exposure
  yo your focus is fucking shit and sharktooth over there has to play it up less
          underexposed face in all of these  learn to manually expose for subjets face its okay if the background becomes overexposed slightly
  this one has potential    your model looks evil btw
  these are both very wrong
  underexposed face in all of these  its not a problem with exposure but with white balance  white balance auto    buy a grey card its good for both exposure and white balance use spot metering on grey card or better yet buy/borrow a light meter    see the difference    also note that streetlight is monochromatic means its not just yellow tinted its made of only a narrow spectrum of light lacks of blue light and very little red  you wont be able to compensate it with white balance  but monochromatic photos not only bw can be good also so no need to avoid street light just know what you have  its like a first thing to think about before taking a photowhat light do i have

  stfu i have a uhd display also my pictures are sharper 1000px than its sooc drunk snapshits
1 make sure the eyes are in focus humans automatically look towards the eyes so missing eye focus will fuck up the whole image    2 if you dont bring your own light find a spot where the subject is lit enough for you to up the shutter speed to at least 1/125 otherwise the pictures will suffer from blur which again is fucking up whole image    shooting at night is a chore if youre underequipped you dont really have too many options other than sticking to max open aperture and fast enough shutter speed to avoid blur then just adjust iso as needed your images might be real noisy but its still better than blur or missed focus and i think you could do with some better postprocessing as well
  no i chickened out and couldnt close the deal but the good news is shes excited for another date so i may try my luck then

  i was going to look through all of these and give advice but since you didnt resize i cant be bothered
  lighting  composition  exposure    thats a polite way of asking you to leave until youve actually tried to learn something in a photography class youd be the guy who wastes everyones time trying to argue why you should be allowed to break every rule in the book that guy doesnt grow into a great photographer or even a kinda good one
  you sound insecure
    exposure time 1/15 sec  fnumber f/18  exposure program aperture priority  iso speed rating 1600  exposure mode auto  white balance auto    these are the best photos in a series of at least 50 images    you need to start by figuring out how a camera actually works thats the easiest thing for you to do and the longer you put it off the longer youre going to fight extremely simple problems like white balance proper exposure or camera/subject movement the problems i would be most concerned with are focusrelated stemming from poor control of exposure     the most simple way to fix your photography would be to crank your iso so you can shoot at a higher shutter speed or smaller aperture or both you can love wide aperture but an image like this  is a straight up mistake the left side of her face is falling out of focus though i dont think you were in focus to begin with    if youre going to auto any setting autoiso and then set aperture and shutter speed to what you need to take a good image
  autoiso  xd
                  shutter speed too slow depth of field too shallow need better lighting        everything is out of focus

  mfw i sold this camera for a quick buck a few years back  mfw i ended up losing all of my snapshits that id backed up due to two hard drives failing at the same time  mfw if i hadnt sold the camera i couldve probably gotten a hundred or more old photos off of the memory stick  such is life learned a ton off of this camera it was my first camera i ever bought and had no optical viewfinder you could change iso exposure and aperture by selecting dropdown menus the dial on the top was just for mode switching the digital viewfinder gave a good approximation of what higher/lower exposure/iso would do to the image and effectively taught me how to shoot manual

  nice overall i wouldnt recommend this point and shoot its way too old i believe its close to 18 years old
  ive had a mavica for a few years now   lost the charger so i havent used it for awhile     over all the photos have a nice look
  the one thing i have never understood was why it had a video mode when the longest video you could record was literally 5 seconds
    yet nowadays ios has live mode photos which are even shorter
how come all these look better than phone snapshits even though its inerior tech
  because phones sucks

  those little sony cameras had a snap focus setting a small optical viewfinder and other cool shit
  no wonky color grading and hdr bs probably different size sensors so different dof most phone cameras have an aperture of f/17 which gives you about the same dof as f/13 on full frame
i wonder if/when my old equipment like  canon 1000d shitty dslr from 2008  canon mv900 minidv camcorder from 2006  olympus u300 32mpix camera from 2003  panasonic nvm5 vhs camcorder from 198x  become trendy again
    nice af congratz anon
  not before my canon d60 from 2002 a 62mp monster
  the minidv and vhs cameras will never become trendy again because the recording format mini disc and tape is a bitch to work with

  youre on 4chan a site know for shitposting trolling and racismwhat did you expect people would post fine art    most of the photographers here only shoot creepshots for their fap folder not shit to put in an art museum
  why not both
  those arent mutually exclusive

  finally got some decent weather and sun
  so you took your bad photo used a good highresolving printer to print a negative transparency of your 16mpix photo and made a bad cyanotype of the alreadyprinted transparency because muh analogue process    have you ever you know considered using that printer to print you know the actual photo in as many sharp contrasty b/w copies as you need for less than the cost of the cyanotype kit paper and plastic transparency    process wankery for process sake with horrible results epitome of /p/ gearfagging/process over photo     at least tweak your transparencys contrast to print out properly did you even use a peroxide developing bath after rinsing
  i think i already said this when you posted the negative in the discord the one where  is banned but ill say it again sure its a really nice photo i like the lines and the contrast
  yeah it was my first print for this series so ive got to tweak my transparency a bit since it is a bit blurry around the edges i appreciate the feedback
  why you gotta be that way guys having fun with photography i dont think hes claiming that this is an amazing new way to get perfect photos hes fucking around with an interesting process and having a good time with it     the world is on fire around us let him eke out some joy goddamn

    i disagree the sony vx1000 uses minidv and is a staple of skateboard videography     obviously its not digital but nostalgia for that grainy turn of century look has been alive and well for years i remember watching the baker videos in high school and dying to get my hands on a vx

i got a mavica and it seems like its taking pretty good photos with good being a metric of looks accurately like something from the turn of the millennium i dont have a floppy reader to upload them yet but soon i will
  i love my mavica when im shooting it but seeing those postage stamped size pics on a 4k monitor once you get them uploaded is a bit of a buzzkill

  oh and also ty will be seeking the model out totally forgot abt this
  one reason is several of the cameras used in this thread have real lenses on them that are larger than an eraser head theres no replacement for bigger glass
  1 out of 44 is a great ratio
late 90s and early 2000s digicams have this /x/ quality to them that i love if this was taken with a newer camera in clear detail it would look like a generic photo of some industrial building      but with an older camera it becomes mysterious and somewhat sinister

lol
dress up nicely to go to a party  sit on the bus gazing out the window  young guy walks up directly outside and snaps a photo   walks off before i can react  feelsgoodman  anyone else got comfy street photography experiences
  that guy was me you looked cool and i wanted to suck your dick but now that i know youre a trump supporter i am going delete my snapshit of you
  iits just a meme anon
  memes aside  anon desu sometimes i intentionally take photos of people just to make them happy specially those loners who sit in corner while staring other people  it so cute that photog make you happy     im gonna go fully comfy mode in my poncho tonight and im gonna lurk the streets with my fuji on /nightwalk/
when i lived in sf people would photograph my dog and i doing stupid shit all the time     i also photobombed peoples shots at tourist locations constantly its easy to get away with making silly faces behind people while you go by on your bike
i was taking a nap in the streets because i was a drunk and a fat fuck took a picture of me and posted on his instagram account and tried to scam people over his shit
  anon desu sometimes i intentionally take photos of people just to make them happy specially those loners who sit in corner while staring other people  i would be so unbelievably upset if this happened to me
  god fucking damn this picture
  noooooooooooo
  well i ask for permission   nobody refused yet and they mostly smile for photo so fuck you
compact camera  night vision  built in illumination    is there no replacement for this
cant find info on this is this shit out really want me some nightvision/thermal camera for aesthetic
  out and gone my friend i ended up getting a life pixel converted olympus m43 thing and an external ir lamp id love to have it all in the same package
  you can make a ir 8mp camera with a raspberry pi for 80
  that looks like a fine subject to photograph  let me plug this into the nearest wall outlet and boot up some linux
  use your head the new zero w is the size of a credit card has built in wifi and can be powered by a portable battery or if youre not a tard you can make an adapter to use existing batteries if a company can make a shitty ir camera then you can make a shitty ir camera there are tons of ir flashes for cheap too on ebay you could also make your own ir flash too the booting issue is true but you can auto boot programs
isnt there some legal shit considering resolution limit of ir sensors for consumer use
  seeing as how there used to be 8x10 ir film no
  there are very different kinds of infrared if you replace an irblocking filter on a regular camera with an irpassing one ie  youll only get near infrared range 7002000nm which looks unusual and can be used to see in the dark without a visible light source but otherwise isnt much different from visible light long infrared light which is used for thermal imaging and has radically different absorption properties eg it passes through smoke but is blocked by glass requires completely different sensors which are subject to government regulations and are generally too expensive for consumer use anyway  a vgaresolution longinfrared camera head can easily cost 5 figures

alright guys what are your opinions on film emulation presets like mastin labs and vsco are they a true replication of film or just a waste of money unless you buy them off the pirate bay of course    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makecanoncamera modelcanon eos 1300dcamera softwareadobe photoshop lightroom classic 74 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/18imagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20180730 143918exposure time1/200 secfnumberf/28exposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating400lens aperturef/28exposure bias0 evmetering modepatternflashno flash compulsoryfocal length5000 mmcolor space informationsrgbrenderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandard
i downloaded a bunch off pirate bay to test and they are pretty bad
  never used those but if theyre editable and you know what you want it to look like then why not  youd be better served by just applying what they do in lr or whatever youre using its just a combination of s curve split toning using colour wheel combos desaturation and some shadow lifting until it looks rightthen save as your own preset this way you keep the important things under control without ending up with the excessive contrast mess most of these packs seem to generate presumably because the target audience is phone users   much more satisfying doing it yourself as well
film emulation  seems the most sensible way is to use an actual film camera  oh wait this is the instant gratification generation were talking about  is there a preset that can clean my house for me i would like totally buy it
  waste of money  lol just torrent it faggot     also on presets i think vsco and mastin labs presets are really cool as your staring point into the world of lightroom and working with presets in general presets give your images really cool look your workflow will become fast and consistent    my suggestion would be to work with those presets for sometime and then select your most used presets then study your favorite presets why you like them which tool do what which tool gives specific tones how hsl and split toning works grain etc then modify those vsco presets according to your taste or make your own presets   but think using vsco as foundation is a good step       this is also   but first study your favorite presets
  also yes i unironically think that vsco and mastin labs give that film look     mfw i post my digital vsco edited snapshits in /fgt/ to get some yous and on instagram for dem sweet hipster trend hoping npc every film photo is good filmisnotdead shootfilm followers
i shoot film but i also shoot digital i use the haldclut film simulation in rawtherapee for some films i find it gets close enough but for others it is completely off i have no problems with using filmsims because shooting film especially 35mm is pantsonhead retarded i cant wait to drop my film gear for good id say 99 of people cant tell the difference between filmsim and actual film and 100 dont care     no one even cares about photography anymore and thats fine because its a dead art if it was art to begin with photography takes no skill and effort these days so fake it if you want
  you need to start your life over again
    cant find mastin labs torrent
    off by one
  presets have ruined photography and the idea that you can digitally emulate film is laughable
  t boomer
  t thinks vsco looks like film  t doesnt know what film looks like  t nu/p/

  bitter boomer hate fellow film shooters   your brain is too high on the smell of your own braps    why dont you post your snapshits  i sometime do make a thread or two     ill tell you exactly why vsco sucks ass  nobody needs your validation vsco presets give me film look to manipulate normies now i modified those presets which are pretty close to actual film stocks  i have 6k followers on ig normies think that i shoot medium format film but guess what i dont
  being this much of a boomer    jesus christ man just stop i even shoot film almost exclusively and this is embarrassing i would never touch film emulation and even i understand it has some advantages over real film

why the fuck doesnt the keystone function produce perfectly straight lines   pic related keystone is applied but the bottom line is skewed i need a perfect rectangle
learn to understand perspective before taking a photograph then dumbass acquire a camera with movements keystoning is just for digicucks
  well i am a digicuck anyone else has any idea
  your answer is tilt/shift lens get one
  i dont need one the lightroom transform tool produces good enough results i expected keystone to produce the same perfect rectangle result
  well then why arent you using lightroom
  because im tethering with capture one i use lcc and from what i gather colorchecker calibration is not very good with lightroom

  reposting from the previous thread in case it might be useful for anyone    s the best camera available on a budget    150 and below canon eos m easily the best video for the cheapest price on the second hand market needless to say it doesnt have as much sharpness or overall image quality when compared to more expensive bodies but hack it with firmware upgrades like magic lantern and you can expect some surprisingly solid 25k raw footage thats usable for most projects    150400 canon eos 7d universally known as one of the most popular entry level cameras for filmmakers a couple of years back and even today still arguably the most competitive one for a sub400 budget much like the eos m it also has an excellent amount of downloadable firmware upgrades that will boost up the bitrate and give you some rather sharp results especially for a camera this old    4001000 panasonic covers this price range well enough the cheapest and most popular one probably being the lumix g7 and if youre willing to shill out a little more for a newer model on retail the g80 / g85 and the g9 are also great choices with slightly higher specs all of them are 4k capable with excellent sensors and the micro 4/3rds compatibility also allows for plenty of choices as far as lenses go    10002000 bmpcc 4k for the best prosumer cinematic video on the market by a considerable margin lumix gh5 if you want more still photography options while not compromising on some nonetheless excellent video capabilities either of them are versatile enough to serve you well on almost every kind of video situations though spending about 800 extra bucks on the gh5 should be entirely dependent on exactly what kind of work you plan on doing with it

is this actually vera farmiga or is it a body double    speaking of nudity in hollywood movies will hollywood use deepfake ai technology to seamlessly blend body double and actress face together in the future
what should i start filming if i dont have many friends
  its a double she said it herself     will hollywood use deepfake ai technology to seamlessly blend body double and actress face together in the future  they dont really need deepfake its already relatively easy with current technologies black swan i tonya they did a big scene like that in game of thrones and the result was pretty good
  its a double she said it herself    damn is there a website where you can find out if a particular movei scene used body doubles for actresses i think its an interesting topic i remember kate beckinsale using a body double for the shower scene in whiteout i think

well /vid/ i finished a two day shoot on a short film today i dont really know if i can have any festival hope since it seems to be inconsistent whether or not they like what i make with them normally disliking it  but above all fuck im tired filming really fucking kills me every time and i feel like its constantly pushing me to the limit also you guys will be proud since the majority of the film was shot between f/8 and f/13 rather than going for an overly shallow depth of field    /blogpost
whats your opinion on using diffusion filters with modern high dynamic range cameras  i used to use the shit out of 1/4 black pro mist and the lighter ultracons becasue they were available at uni and were kind of needed with the old stuff like the f35 that clipped highlights in an ugly way or just ran out of fill light on small sets but kind of stopped when renting more and more am i missing something or is this stuff pretty much useless now with 15 stops of latitude and therefore just a look that can be done more or less completely in post
  the people who shoot at wide open apertures usually do it because they are too lazy cheap or stupid to buy eternal lighting to light their scenes and not for meh bokeh    awesome job anon not falling for an overused memeshallow dof    unless youre shooting using candle light for meh atmosphere there is no need for meh wide open aperture
if i use a canon dslr would a couple of fotodiox pro led312ds from bh be good lights for set use i see the kit is 140 i dont know how big it is but it seems awfully small i also see a neewer upgraded 400 led video light on amazon for 80 i dont know if there is a kit option for it but that seems like another one i might get    a year or so ago when i was in college i made my directing film with a c300 and a rebel i think i know it was one of them i had a regular video light i cant remember which one exactly it may have been an arri 650w fresnel and some led light that had an adjustable color temperature and brightness dont remember the size but it wasnt necessarily a large or heavy light more like mid sized the footage came out great regardless which light i used    when i did reshoots i had the dslr and some old led light that you put on the hotshoe mount i screwed the light onto a separate tripod and it worked okay for what i needed the footage was mostly okay but sometimes i had no choice but to use a deflicker plugin in ae to mask the horizontal bands rolling up as best as i could i am assuming it has something to do with the shutter speed 1/50 recording at 23976fps and the refresh rate of that light    if i got a couple of the fotodiox or neewer lights i mentioned earlier would i have an issue with the lines running up/down
is an iphone 8 better than a canon 700d
   is an iphone as good as a canon  if you want to use it as an anal vibrator yes if you want to use it as a video camera no
  youre correct that is a shutter speed issue the way to correct it is to change your shutter speed im pretty sure 99 of lights will divide nicely if you use 1/50 or 1/60 of a second  monitor your footage as you shoot and correct it as needed if you shoot at 1/60 of a second at 24fps it wont ruin or even impact your footage
  is there an easy way to deal with mp4s going into davinci the only way i can seem to work with it is to convert everything to movs to import to resolve any tips

   my computer randomly restarts without warning when trying to install software    are you sure its not the fault of windows 10 that sounds a lot more like a microsoft forced update type of thing than a blackmagic type of thing 
  maybe i mean its never happened before like this but its possible

  depends on your hardware especially the read speed of your drives  with the 46k cinemadng of the ump for me a basic grade usually renders slightly faster than real time up to about 25x real time using compressed dng so for me its clearly bottlenecked by the random read speed of the drives with all the overhead of the onefileperframe shit braw is a hell of a lot faster both because its more compressed but also because its a single file 4k and above cinemadng is practically unusable unless youre using large ssd raids exclusively

  try r/filmmakers so long as you post your workflow and some facts about your filmmaking experience along with your film or video youre golden its a good community as far as reddits go  other than that ive got nothing except for this if you think youve got even a little bit of confidence and charisma and im thinking that you do dont be afraid to get involved in the youtube videography community so long as you dont mind talking to the camera a few simple stepbystep reviewtype recommendation and tutorial videos that follow your own journey in learning filmmaking can get you quite an online following and thats just from doing what is essentially an educational filmmakers vlog the only thing you need to do this successfully is decent editing skills audio lighting and a camera that can keep you in focus this is a very unobtrusive way to get people interested in your work  you can also post tests to youtube people look at those a lot and its another fun way to get noticed albeit maybe not in the manner that youre hoping    other than that theres no one stop shop for recognition if youve got talent and good storytelling skills people will catch on just keep em coming dude and have fun i think when you have fun with video it shows in the content and it really gives it a spark of life just like with any other form of art if it feels like work take a break i think the type of videos youre talking about producing should be fun and not require a whole lot of stress likewise i think its less important in your case to self promote unless you have a specific series or project in the works that you want to market and more important to just make videos that you would want to watch    dont be afraid to share on facebook people are used to seeing boring videos so i find that making a few interesting skits works wonders    sorry if that doesnt help much ive never selfpromoted before
  no thank you this was great i was actually just expecting a bunch of fuck off cuck posts i like the ideas about tutorial stuff but am definitely also focusing more on personality aspect and having fun/ being entertaining     i actually did post the vid on r/ filmakers though i did not post about my workflow which is a great tip currently the only views on my video are my own so just have to keep thinking of creative ways to bait the kids into watching haha     thanks man
    you may listen to someone who is doing marketing with a scientific eye or dont listen your choice    to sum it up beforehand all these sites like this one here which are used by the social waste and reject are merely good for testing not for actual promotion    the benefit of these people is that they are honest anonymousy and general frustration lead to a mindset which reacts on an immediate base this is more useful than socalled normal people on normal sites who tend to dissemble their actual opinion and motives but only to a certain extend  you can not expect to generate an actual fanbase with these people here their level of frustration and jealousy will always restrain them from giving someone  who couldve been them if they would just start starting something  the benefit of attention let alone money or success in general    but what can you test here if you dont have infrastructure then your only option seems to contentbased marketing you cannot enforce attention as you already seem to know so you have to go the hard way of providing content in a way which induces wordofmouth build you content and the storytotell tell the story and see the reactions to it proceed until you feel that you have a functioning story and product  then go somewhere else    it is a task to decode the reactions here and everywhere though in spite of people reacting immediate here you cannot take words at face value ignorance is your enemy but keep one thing in mind you are also here you are part of the waste you claim now what also you dont grant others attention you are now the one having the problem but youve always been the problem so ask yourself how would you react to the story you tell you have to find the story you would react to yourself  then tell it sane people

reasons to not buy a nikon d750 for video     background   be me skills in adobe cc   guy asks if i want to do a few jobs   work mainly at festivals/concerts   the team owns only nikon mostly d750 a few shitty d3xxx and d5xxx   get more into filming   question of my life stick to the other guys with nikon or buy blackmagic/sony
  get a nikon if you want to take photos and do video    get the blackmagic if you just want to do video    i switched from nikon to blackmagic because of  muh record limit times    sony is more expensive than either the nikon or the blackmagic so only get sony if youre a richfag

    anyone know how to make the 5d mark iv video not suck ass no matter what settings i use it looks like top of the line 720p from 2003 i can get it to an acceptable look in post but for such an expensive camera im pretty irritated glass is an canon l lens so thats not it
  i use that camera and in my opinion the footage i get looks pretty great  i would blame the lenses youre using not the camera but having said that you should be shooting on either neutral or standard picture profiles unless you want to use a pseudo log profile
ok thinking about trying my luck with video to learn the basics and whatnot what software does /p/ recommend for the gnu plus linux operating system  kdenlive lives cinelerra    or do i really need adobe
  despite of what every damn sheep in here will recommend you id even say try to avoid adobe and all that brands strictly    kdenlive is a solid yet simple nle lives i actually dont know cinelerra has a learning curve but is fast as hell you could also look into blender its video editor and compositor have also a learning curve and arent any close as fast as cinelerra but are extremly mighty some people also recommend lightworks but for me blender is just beyond everything else due to the insane amount of possibilities  so if you look out for potential go with that if you look for basic simplificity go with kdenlive or whatever you find there if you are in a professional environment and time is an issue go with cinelerra  and only if you are a brainless follower with no ambitions no technical understanding and no readyness to take the word digital in digital filmmaking even half serious then go with adobe davinci avid and all that insane crap dont go with apple products tho under no circumstances
  thank you in that case im going to try to deepen my knowledge on kdenlives modules and try out cinelerra too blender is a scary piece of software im a bit intimidated by    i was considering adobe as last resort if free software alternatives lack some important functionality
  sounds sane enough be advised that free software does not lack any functionality the opposite is mosty true it merely lacks usability sometimes
  some linux builds can run resolve also lightwrks is a competitive option i wouldnt be surprised if you can use blender since it seems to do everything
  well thats mostly true but there are exceptions for example im yet to find a free software alternative to kontakt audio sampler that is on the same level in terms of options dynamics of the virtual instruments and available libraries though i guess in the end it all comes down mostly to workflow rather than functionality per se meaning more time in order to achieve the same results      i see though if possible i rather stick with the free libre software ecosystem if im to use nonfree software i might as well just use windows altogether
  audio on linux is quite a science for reasons but this is the best example in terms of software processing audio is so simple that it all comes down to usability and musical workflows are highly specialized and a question of subjective preferences so it is no wonder that commercial products set through i have an audio studio myself and i started with all that fancy software products but when building a linux pipeline i realized that all this fancy software is donkey ass anyways and i relaced everything with hardware components i have good converters and a spdif pipeline connecting samplers synths and effects i never had any software sampler synth or effect that would have been close to a hardware one  the only advantage with pure software routines is the quantity of possibilities 1 bio synths out there 99 of them shit    id recommend just use a good multitrack daw as you base software maybe ardour and provide it with selected hardware modifiers or renderers forget the 14765th vst plugin or directx crap plugin
so ive had some good news lately my short got selected by a random russian short film festival and then today a festival organiser contacted me and basically promised me an award if i submitted to their festival so i did so i know a fool and his money are easily split but i feel good about it for now  its weird actually getting into festivals i fear ive raised my bar too high with my last few shorts actually getting even this modicum of success which isnt even real success    i feel like i can finally say i am a filmmaker not just a hobbyist whos had a few paid jobs i literally mean less than five oh well just thought id share  /blog
  i see well the problem with hardware components is that they cost relatively of course a lot of money i tend to follow the philosophy of dont buy hardware if software can do it besides i dont really have money to begin with of course if i ran a studio i would probably want have real hardware over emulators that try to mimic hardware    as an amateur who just likes to play around i can say i enjoy zynaddsubfx and bristol software synths quite a lot they sound amazing but when it comes to samplers well better just reboot to windows and use kontakt /
  libre has fucking nothing to offer for video
  i see though if possible i rather stick with the free libre software ecosystem if im to use nonfree software i might as well just use windows altogether  fsftier free is the path of hard work not the path of easy answers from a cavedrawing forum why are you even here
  i dont get it if money is crucial then you shouldnt waste it on software especially money for software is lost money for hardware is invested dependant on what you buy you may loss some value but you never loss all of it also hardware is more stable and reliable you dont need updates and a change of your system will not lead to the need of purchasing everything again  open source and free software  selected hardware will be cheaper than an allproprietarysoftware solution
  listen dude we all know now that you got your first selection for a festival congratulations in case you wonder why you get no or little or useless responses consider to provide a little more information show us your short film tell us the name of the festival tell us who you are and what you do if you expect us to applaude some random anon who obviously has no friends he could celebrate with or get appreciation from then you live in an illusion  anyways /vid/ is a bunch of envy wannabes and even people who actually provide stuff just look at that poor grader girl who gets nothing but hurr durr have a hard time so please stop being a coward gimmecompliments and choose at least to be an appreciationsucking attention whore or  if you cant come out of your shed  fuck off with your cringy attitude you are no filmmaker you are a joke
  cringe
  why does this look familiar
  cringe
  this wasnt my first festival nor was i seeking congratulations ive used /vid/ for years as a way of venting/rambling about my experiences so that i dont become someone who can only talk about their films and filmmaking in real life  im sorry youve been hurt in the past
  eh it just depends on what you shoot     you definitely fucked up in with your lens economy that sony glass is expensive and theres fewer variety but you now have a camera that isnt a paperweight indoor/after sunset
  well unless im working professionally as registered busyness tons of proprietary software can just be pirated so its cost zero cant get any cheaper than that
  fair enough then
why is there always a red rectangle on hollywood movie cinema cameras
  it shows the cinema image area/safe area
  safe area markers the camera may not be shooting at the aspect ratio you plan to deliver in
    elaborate
  say youre shooting with a red monstro at 8192x4320 thats 191 say you want to make your movie in 2391 for a 4k scope delivery the safe area markers help you frame appropriately for post production by showing you how the shot will look on the timeline
  cool
  this anon is correct    screen sizes differ and arent usually the same aspect ratio of the sensor or film on which it was recorded the safe area box lets you know what part of the recorded media will have action in frame and what part will be cut out     the graphic here shows the safe areas on a frame of 35mm film for different applications the red box is for super 35 like for display on a cinema screen the dashed box is for 43 the ratio of old tvs
  what is this from anon
  looks like some hhh to me
i need some advice i do a videography for live studio music performances for my schools radio station and i need an upgrade because i plan on shooting short films soon budget is around 1300 and i would go with the bmpcc4k but the accessories needed to make it even remotely usable puts it past the budget im looking at the sony a6500 since good low light necessary because of studio lighting ibis log and decent 4k iq however the battery life and overheating might be a deal breaker so ive started considering the panasonic g85 with a nikon speedbooster to compensate for low light and to adapt my primes i might upgrade to the bmpcc4k in the future so i was thinking this would be the better way to go for now and for the future since i could reuse the speedbooster thoughts
  you can either fall for every damn tech spec meme out there or you can get a decent solution for low money choose wisely
  accessories needed to make it even remotely usable  you mean a couple of spare batteries
  i bought the pocket 4k and its still insanely cheap for what youre getting depending on what youre using it for the battery life isnt much of an issue either buy some spare lps or buy some cheap vlocks     you also dont need a speedbooster for it to work you can buy a dummy adaptor for cheap and save up for a speedbooster provided you dont need the electronics    and if youre talking about media then the ssd option is actually dirt cheap especially when compared to cfast cards
      the shot is from an anthology film called in our time 1982 an anthology collection of short films from the taiwan new wave
    its funny how you can post random screenshots of any movie and no one cares but the moment it has an asian girl in it all the yellow fever betas come begging for sauce
  thanks my dude      you projecting
  because they want to fap to the movie

hey there /vid/  ive been working as a camera operator/cutter/director in tv station in switzerland for the last 2 years ive been doing almost everything and learned so unbelievably much in that time  in the last few month i was set in charge of producing music videos for local swiss bands with an intern who has been in our company for 2 month that time  i wanna know what you guys think of one of my productions so far        ive seen a few sharpness problems there  please give me some feedback to this clip    this video was shot with 2 sony fs5 both with a 18105 zoom lens and a gopro 5
  youre poor go panasonic spend more on glass and audio
can we put this to an actual poll which looks better barry lyndon or 2001 a space odyssey  note which looks better not which is the better film also not which film is more technically impressive/used lenses from nasa    im just kind of curious
  i highly doubt you are the person of charge of this video you are most likely the intern who thinks he can do better video than this tv station and you just want to hear from us how shit the video is so that you can feel superior to your boss who probably treats you like shit  but you know maybe he is right and you are just an arrogant little as who thinks hes so avantgarde because he once watched bergmann unfortunately you seem just to be a sad swissboy who will never make it out the capsuled land incest and xenophobia
  comparing the look of scifi with historic film  meh dude  you didnt think that through maybe read adornos aesthetic theory
has anyone here used an underwater drone before or have any experience with them
  i guess i did a good job then  i mean there is nothing to prove that i am what i told but you do you  you have all the rights to doubt me  so what do you actually think about video
  yeah its decent well done no complains from my side it matches exactly what a viewer would expect from a volksmusik music clip thats what its all about
  you need to add some hawt lesbian action to that video to appeal to the 4chan incel crowd if you do that your video will go viral
   used lenses from nasa     didnt you know that kubrick used the lenses from nasa to shoot the moon landing in a sound stage to ensure that wed be the russians to the moon
    he was talking about barry lyndon anon
  i was just fucking around with him and seeing if i could bait any conspiracy nuts who thought that the moon landing was directed by kubrick
so another day passes and another day i got zero editing done  anyone else have this    i mean i can probably self assess myself psychoanalytically unedited the film might still be a masterpiece it can be anything but as soon as it gets edited it has a determinable quality to it and theres a fear it will come out shite  but even guessing at why it doesnt change the frustration that arises from not getting anywhere  fuck
  bullshit your movie is just dog shit and you know it and even if you waste your time to finish it it will just lay around and waste storage and all that for a couple of views from your few friends who actually think you should finally give it up what you eventually will do anyways  let filmmaking to people who actually cant wait to finish their projects and sit night after night to get it as fast as possible even these will fail when ut comes to attention so what do you expect you will ever achive when cant even motivate youself  pathetic
  the moon landing is his best work
  my advice is to use meth then youll be awake for a long time and can get your film edited    or if youre rich buy some coke and use it too keep you awake so you can edit your film
  nasa gave him the lenses he had to thank him for filming the moon landing how else do you think he was able to get access to lenses created for nasa
  when i get to work sometimes i just dont have the motivation to edit some  sometimes the bubble of creative thoughts just pops and you going on becomes a massive pain in the ass  since i work in the studio i have to finish my shit tho there is no way around it    just dont drop the project dude  if it is a masterpiece while unedited you can make it even better in editing
  just wait for braw and use uhsii cards      i love the cinematography of barry lyndon but 2001 definitely edges out it hasnt aged remotely and looks absolutely phenomenal compared to modern cg
what are pretty good handheld stabilization options for a sony a6000 for  100 im not expecting any miracles in this price range
  the glidecam clones from flycam are pretty good especially the redking might get one of these used or a smaller one for around that price
what does a production company do
  production in generally where decision about money and content converge a production company will decide what will be done and how much it will/may/can cost thereby it should be profitoriented and know what content to which costs has how much potential to produce profit
  do producers work with production companies for them or are they entirely separate
  producers appear as individuals or in company production companies tend to invest own money where individual producers mostly engage in a project as the competence to hold bonded capital a prod company consits among others of producers and clerks and marketing experts and quiet financiers and so on
  cool cool
    videography vs cinematography    blackmagics sensor tends to mimic the traditional film look to most peopleand yes film is a language and thus always in flux the digital look will eventuallly become film    gh5 is a killer daily carry camera especially boosted but it is clearly more video usecase doesnt mean you cant get a film look out of it it just isnt its core focus like a pickup truck vs a sportscar vs a minivan they can roughly all do the same thing but some things easier than others
    youve got to go to where its being made its as simple as that    find people locally semilocally or move to the places where its being made    theres no other way trust me or find out for yourself either way
how can i become a filmmaker i work as a video producer at an advertising agency and it paids off well but im sick of it  i have a bunch of scripts but have no crew no friends im a foreigner here and the big production houses could take me as an intern to prove myself i dont have experience on set only small productions only produced 2 shorts before and they were award winners but it was a shitty festival at college i feel trapped  i cant leave my job because i got a rent to pay but im desperate to do what i love
  take some initiative theres no easy solution  most filmmakers happen to be in a financially stable enough position to pursue their passion which is why its dominated by middle class kids
    as this answers is generally true it does not respect the actual problem of the questioner  the main problem seems to be the social situation while also lowerclass kiddos can build a team of ambitious coworkers it seems to be unlikely harder for someone from a forgein background the barriers will not only tighten the process of acquiring people but will most likely lead to not being able to finish the project due to cultural misunderstandings and differences    my advise would be to concentrate on a minimal setting find two people you can actually bond with and are reliable then elaborate a project which is not dependant on more people than you three this seems to be very limited but try to see it as an opportunity to reach maximum creativity as i always say annoyingly even to people who dont want to hear it creativity is not about accomplishing the ideal circumstances but about accomplishing the best out if the given circumstances aka the one you have with you
a trick people use to get around youtubes compression is to upscale their videos of course quality isnt going to increase but when played back at a higher resolution youtube allows higher bitrates is there a way to edit the metadata of a video file so that the resolution appears to be larger rather than resizing the actual video
  not possible resolution has nothing to do with metadata  you have to blow it up to 4k at a 50ish bitrate to get a good result with youtube  maybe add some noise on the new pixel level to create some artificial detail get even less blocking
    we are pleased to announce the release of davinci resolve 1521
  not possible resolution has nothing to do with metadata  okay i didnt know that  maybe add some noise on the new pixel level to create some artificial detail get even less blocking  is that a legitimate technique source on this information how would you do that with ffmpeg for instance
  not possible resolution has nothing to do with metadata  well it does get used by the decoder to properly set up the decoding process but setting it this way would simply screw the whole process and produce invalid input in most situations  maybe add some noise on the new pixel level to create some artificial detail get even less blocking  lossy compression favors lack of noise so adding more will not help as the youtube encoder may struggle to keep the noise grain while maintaining a standardized bitrate youll get a worse output in the end id argue it would be smarter to do the opposite and denoise it to an acceptable degree      it has to be upscaled no way around that
  it is  this is the basic idea    no idea about ffmpeg though i just use the film grain ofx in resolve for things like that
    reason 123245643212 to not use fcpx    apple has finally dun it once again
    scaling up losing information  adding noise losing information  compress scaled up noised material cannot compress effectively  scaling down again losing information    yeah  those experts here  sigh
whats the main cause of video nosie in poor lighting is it just the gain or could something else affect it
  i think means lens and a monitor
is the xt3 a meme for video
  i crab on this board again and again about this strange low light misunderstanding what is wrong with you low light does not make a picture noisy per se high iso gain dr compression and/or false gamma setting does all you must be retarded if you simply raise these settings as soon as your lightmeter is blubbing underexposed  that being said sensors tend to perform worse in darks near to noise floor and highs aliasing  details than in mid values but with the right gamma curve you supress shadow noise below the luminance threshold   i mean seriously im just thinking are you all so amateurish that you shoot in low light and then raise the darks in post could you be so stupid you have to lower the curve in the darks if you didnt already incam    if you do what a student learns in the first semester then there is no significant noise visible in shadows and lowkey in general  poor camera manufactures have to deal with prosumers who want to gain shadows which is technologically a total contradiction and have to find a way to preprocess the image by denoising it to death so that these clever videographers can say uuuhhh luk at muh lowligt pafomanz  damn it
  thanks very informative although douchey
  welcome
  dont you get much better images if you denoise the image in post rather than if you use in camera denoise option assuming your using a proper cinema camera and not a shitty camcorder of course
  depends on the one hand at which stage the denoising takes place generally the earlier the better on the other hand on how much time you have the more the better  so ideally you have a real raw format and can use a heavy algorithm in post given that the raw is real lossless and early enough which it mostly is not so onthefly incam denoisers are sometimes more effective  also because the engineers who build the camera knew exactly what kind of algorithm they needed for what their built but thats a different story    anyway your response supports my statement that clean shadows outofcamera is a useless feature if you really need them for some weird reason you better clean them in post
  buys a camera from a brand focused on the joy of the process of taking pictures  worries about video
  not necessarily to contradict you but i want to point out that from experience ive realised i get better results from raising the iso in camera and then lowering in post as opposed to just shooting with a lower iso  i know you basically said this but you didnt it in kind of a rantish dumb way that can be ambiguously interpreted    also better performance at high iso values isnt a meme or an illogical expectation companies are putting a lot of money into research here because it can make such a huge difference mainly talking about documentaries that it appeals to prosumers who dont want to deal with lights just means it also has significant financial incentive for these companies  the camera manufacturers arent poor at all theyre simply trying to provide a service as demanded by the market or not  i passed on buying a gh5 almost entirely because i could see very visible noise in videos shot at iso800 im not talking about videos where they tried to brighten everything in post for me thats not acceptable
  if people said they wanna have a good iso performance or a camera which they can use for weak available light situations i wouldnt ramble but there seems to be that weird misconception that the one or other camera would furiously start to destroy its images once there is not much light which isnt true they just adjust the cam flawly every cam with basic setting abilities like iso and shutter gives clean results in lowlight situations it just is a dark result from why it is called lowlight  available light is not the same as lowlight lowlight is mostly much more than at least weak available light low is relative to a normal set lighting and normal light is a hell lot of light  also in your case your result would be even better if you would add a little bit more light to your scene instead of raising iso not only for technical reasons but also because you then automatically light the crucial parts of the scene which gives your scene more dynamic and depth and visual storytelling  maybe its a question of taste but mostly you get better results if you work with your medium instead of against it to compare it vagely you technically can build the neck of a bass guitar so strong that you can tune the strings one octave up but is is useless and only will sound stupid technically you better use a shorter neck which is a guitar then taadaa why fight technical limitations if there is a technical sane solution why engineer nightvision sensors if you simply could switch on a light in case there is a reason fair enough but i just wanted to buy one instrument for the whole band is not a valid reason tho
  to be fair its apparently one of the best cameras out there right now for video
  yeah okay buddy
looking to get more stable yet still handheld looking footage using a sony mirrorless    something that looks like this     i recently did a shoot like this with my sony a7iii and although it did definitely look handheld it was a jittery look as opposed to what you see in that video smoother i guess now from what ive seen the camera in use there is large something the size of an ursa mini or sony fs7 a camera you carry at waist height i assume its size and weight make it a more stable camera compared to a small sony mirrorless    is it physically impossible to get footage as jitterless as this out of the camera is something like a gimbal going to just take away any handheld look
  buy a good lens
  you overestimate gimbals especially those without servo motors generally try to get a top smooth result and then disturb the system to get the shakes you want the other way will be way harder
     uhd 3840 x 2160 from 46k sensor readout for 500   no crop in 4k with mechanical ibis   23x crop with digital stabilisation but no loss of detail   4x crop in 2xextender mode with minimal loss of detail when recording 4k video second focal length to every fast prime without dropping to 1080p    so is this the new gh5
  you mean a lens with image stabilisation
just about to have a kid want footage that will hold up well for the future    looking for something small so its easy for the wife to take it everywhere too and awesome autofocus basically idiotlevel ease of use will be used handheld mostly ideally with a flip screen happy to buy lenses if needed but convenience is super important      what about something like the following   a6500/6300   rx100 m5   canon m50   canon g7x ii      any suggestions how do the above match up    thanks and sorry about english
  want footage that will hold up well for the future  use your phone
  im banned from using any sort of smartphone due to the job i hold    otherwise i would buy a mate 20 pro 
  for a quick video of the kid a cheap gopro would be fine the other cameras you listed will probably end up being fussier than what you want and will not be as easy to grab and shoot when the kid is doing something cute also the gopro will easily fit in your wifes purse and if you break it or lose it you wont be out so much money
  some people usually one man crews want a camera that can fit all bills cinema sports run and gun shooting family videos etc    so they are willing to pay a little more for a multiuse camera that or they are thinking about becoming a cinematographer so they want a camera that can do other stuff and optionally shoot cinema imagesbefore they decide to invest in a proper cinema camera    whats wrong with having a swissarmy knife of a camera that can do all the different jobs that you can throw at it
  theres nothing wrong with that but that wasnt the topic the topic was that people try to achive a specific usecase and fail for a different reason than they think a little bit more knowledge would provide a sane solution while the popular solution is a misconception still a solution though  whats wrong with spreading knowledge
  wow
  im banned from using any sort of smartphone due to the job i hold  wtf  i dont think your employer has the right to dictate what electronic devices you use that would be illegal in most countries and i dont think your boss would have a way know anyway unless youre doing some social research like living without a smartphone in 2018 i really dont understand how can a job dictate what workers do during their free time
  needs more chris doyle and mark lee ping bin
  what job do you have ive never heard of any job banning a cell phone outside of the work place and you shouldnt be filming your kid in your workplace anyways 
    he probably just means that hes barred from having a smartphone at work which is something you find occasionally in jobs that have high security clearances like military stuff and so doesnt bother having one at all because then hed have to pay for and maintain two separate phones
  i will never understand m4/3fags  you pay for f/14 lenses but youre using a 24mm to emulate a 50  your dof is going to look like shit no matter what you do no amount of legitimately brilliant tech specs can make up for lens compression its video whats the point
whats the best video editing software right now premiere seems pretty unstable to me its pretty laggy even though i have a decent pc
  i take it you never heard of a speed booster
    youre both morons
best af    sonys phase detection vs canon dual pixel    vote now cunts
  lens compression        please tell me what you think this means
  worked with a c200 recently and its kind of usable at least a lot more than my a7s2  but imo autofocus is not even close to there yet and i wouldnt want to rely on either system on a job atm
  what af do you recommend anon
  canon dpaf if you must but id avoid using af as best as i can
  best af  short focal length small aperature
  im surprised to hear this ill sound like im shilling im sure but i use a canon with dp af and rely on it completely and every shot i take is in perfect focus tracking included i admit it took a while to get to grips with  it made a huge difference when i stopped relying on it to detect what to focus on and changed it to just focus on whatever was in the area i selected
  no i can see it working in a lot of cases actually and maybe if you select your lenses carefully to work well and shoot the right thing in the right style it can work almost all the time no doubt that but from my shortish experience with it where i went in like can i just turn manual focus off and have it working the same way with whatever lens and shot my conclusion is that it cant using the critical things like tap to focus face detection and whatnot it would fail just too often and i dont want that to happen during a serious take
  fcpx
looking for a vlogging/life camera thats compact     how does the g7x ii and rx 100 v match up    1080 vs 4k  wider lens on the canon better for selfie shots  canon has better colors  similar size  which has better af  both similar for stills
  davinci resolve is worth trying out
  none they all suck one way or the other
picked up a bmpcc4k for 437 great condition only a nick or two no sensor danage whatsoever    steal or nah
  sure its the 4k
  clean off the blood and go to town
  inb4 some anon posts about his gear getting stolen on a shoot
  so your staying its literally a steal as in the camera was stolen
  nope  it was the regular did i fuck up
  the cameras basically obsolete these days but not really no  there are few 1080p cameras that are better without spending significantly more though there is some credible claim that the camera isnt really 1080p  it depends what you use it for i suppose
  if ive already a gh5 then what are the other ones youre talking about
    i mean it sort of sucks if you really thought you were getting the 4k but thats still a pretty reasonable price for an original bmpcc regardless you will still definitely pull some impressive footage with it

hey /p/  i recently inherited my grandfathers minolta srt 201 i think id like to try shooting a roll of film just for fun any tips should i develop the film myself will girls think im cool because im shooting film most of my shots are outdoors pic related or at night will film work well for this
  shoot a roll of c41 you can get developed at a local lab first to make sure the camera works something that might have various mechanical failures from old age eg gummed up lubricants rust dirt etc     the meters on cameras that old usually need a mercury battery thats no longer something you can get for blood or money there are various workarounds to use more modern batteries although for regular negative film the easiest is probably just throw an alkaline battery in there its close enough you can also download a light meter app for your phone since that vintage doesnt actually need a battery to function     yes girls will think its cool     no film will not work well for nighttime shots unless you get really good
luminosity masks  radial and linear gradient masks  treat fuji raws  fuji film simulation  plugin xompatible finally    why are you still using memeroom for why dont you get the vastly superior raw editing software that you only have to pay once and own it forever    my prediction is three versions from now at worst you wont need to open photoshop unless youre into those unrealistic arty stuff
  the one you have with you  fuck off shill faggot you dont even take photos you just jerk off to software
  you know if youd framed this as wow the new version of c1 is pretty great instead of ha ha lightroom is for losers you could have actually had a thread with a small amount of value maybe even convinced a few people to switch as it is though this thread is going to be nothing but worthless brandfaggotry     fortunately the hide thread button exists
is it a manual download from their website or will the update servers eventually push the update through the software        not him but its really funny to see you guys throw a hissyfit everytime someone doesnt settle with the adobe bloatware    just accept that there are better alternatives you cant just start parroting muh industry standard everytime someone justifiably criticizes adobe software rofl
  couldnt care less for fuji compatibility  can i move my presets over ive spent far too long making them and lightroom/photoshop is sluggish since day one
  luminosity masks  radial and linear gradient masks    lighroom has that though and nobody gives a fuck about fuji film simulation
  theres actually a to that can do that saw that on one of these photo blogs yesterday didnt tried it myself and i wouldnt because lr and c1 are render raws differently i think youd be better learning color management in c1 counter intuitive af when you start especially coming from lr but youll love it
  capture one fucking sucks faggot
  and lr is painfully slow at processing everything not an opinion a fact       yeah i jerk off to a software than make me spend less time on my computer waiting for files to import render colors better so i dont have to fiddle with too much adjustments to get the result i had in my head and ultimately gives me more time to shoot photos develop a network and be an all around better photographer by wasting less time on a bloated up software    why dont you guys accept it nobody wanted to spend hours in darkrooms back in the days but you are just happy doing shitty panorama hdr and trying two dozen of vsco filters on a single photograph before settling for an overused look
  lightroom isnt for losers its an outdated industry standard that people still use put of habit and because theyre prisons ers of their adobe subscriptions plan plain and simple
  literal screenshot of mobile posting an ad from your poorfag phone    pathetic as all fuck
    no the point is this is barley photography related and is just plain gear sperging i couldnt give a flying fuck what someone uses to edit photos the constant brandfaggatry is annoying as shit if op made a nice thread showing off c1s new update without being a total brandfragging shill shitting another software manufacturer i wouldnt of given a shit could of just made a capture one general or some shit but nah you gotta shit on different manufactures to get replies  enjoy your /g/ tier thread tho try posting a photo thread next time oh wait you dont actually take photos
          fag  faggot  faggotry  fag  faggot    anyone else seeing similarities between the left and right compared to adobe and capture one    capture one users right wing  no namecalling  uses factual evidence to create arguments  proper sentence structures    adobe users left wing  resorts to ad hominem namecalling and other homophobic slurs  poor sentence structure probably because they are so furious that they dont stop to proof read before sending the reply
  right wing  no name calling    lol fuck off to /pol/
  hey /g/pol/tard notice how youre dodging criticism on your shitty shill thread by construing everyone opinion into one strawman respond to individuals and we might take you seriously  resorts to ad hominem namecalling and other homophobic slurs  this is 4chan lurk more f a g g o t
  oh that jsut released i just donwloaded the trial    im on a search for a color manipulation /color grading program for stills with all the features professionel color grading software for film have like color wheels different curves working with masks having littel color banding or fringing    capture one is not bad at this but not enough anyone knows any software    the closet i found is 3d lut creator but its quite inconvenient to use and also lacks some features like drawing masks working in layers different scopes it seems to heavily depend on photoshop      for raw processing i normaly use camera raw but i can see myself switching to capture one even though but maybe i have overlooked something for me it seems like the exposure sliders in raw are better then in c1 being able to go into the negative highlight shadow and having blackpoint/whitepoint sliders  contrast slider in raw sucks because it affects saturation this is much better in c1 with its luma curve clarity is also much better in c1 colors i wouldnt touch in raw
  and lr is painfully slow at processing everything not an opinion a fact  what are you talking about i use lightroom and photoshop on a 5 year old macbook pro and i dont experience slow processing what processes slow for you
  one of these guys owning a 1k phone and a 2k laptop to drink latte macchiato around laughing at anything android and windows    it make sense that you keep using lightroom despite it obvious flaws you dont care about efficiency
  for still images i dont think you need all the tools that are used for video c1 is enough for that in my opinion the example you provided could easily be attained in c1 with color range selection precise masking and the color editor tool never used 3d lut creator but i guess that its more complicated to use than c1 for this type of tasks juding from the ui
  me   left wing  yeah nice try faggot    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpicolor space informationsrgbimage width474image height595scene capture typestandard
  with the color editor i cant freely choose the colors i want only in a range of the original color or is there ore to it    in c1 is there an equivalent to the adjustment brush in camera raw or do you have to use layers and masks to achieve the same result for example bring down only specific highllights
   masks  lighroom has that though  no it doesnt it has some dumb down version of it but its far cry from what you can do with proper ones
fuji  jpeg git gud plebs
  i use skylum 2018   sadly its a little choppy and clunky when it comes to cropping and brush tools but it has the essentials for you to work on your photos
thanks op i wanna stick with capture one infinite trials but pay for lightroom now
  you only have to pay once and own it forever  citation needed i dont see that option on their site but as a fuji shooter im intrigued
  it has luminosity masks that can be applied to adjustment brushes radial adjustment and gradiant adjustments what else do you need
  capture one is right wing   adobe is left wing  wtf im switching n o w
  can i pirate the latest version if not it sucks
  theyre going the old photoshop way buy one version you keep it next major version comes out you need to buy it again
  fidelt around with c1 some more and compared it to camera raw processing some raws with c1 im able to get much better results for heavy color changes i would use something else tough are there maybe some good photoshop plugins

paying for software  ishygddt
  snapshitters shouldnt pay for software i agree
yfw capture one  davinci resolve masterrace
  they will never know theyre drunk the adobe kool aid  muh industry standard
  why are my fit images the fulsize preview so low quality only when i zoom into the picture it gets rendered properly thism akes editing impossible since i dont want to only edit crops at a time
fuck yeah finally moved from lightroom to capture one also ditched shoop and illustrator a while ago for affinity fuck you adobe it feels good to be free from your shitty practices and shitty software that your 100k employees cant fix
question how quickly and efficiently does capture one run on a mac    im super temped but i travel a lot and would kinda hate it if it made my macbook run stupidly hot and it take longer to process my work im only on lightroom because im used to it desu
  try the demo it supports hw acceleration it runs pretty smooth
  image editing is very fast importing large amount of raws and working with large image bases can be quite slow its actually slower than lr in my case of some 3k pics per month
i actually made the switch a few months ago after using lr for close to 8 years    the ui is hideous and dumb and takes some time to get used to but holy shit its actually so much worth it    colors look better sharpening/brightening is insane fuji support is way better too and yeah imports and exports are like 5 times faster
  where is this
  scotland skye    heres another one with hindsight the post processing could have been better on this one but still i tried to edit it both in capture and lightroom and had way better results in capture
btw this thread is all from capture one as well

give me your honest opinion
   fuck you
its a picture  taking with an iphone  wow
  this is the shittiest of snapshits    shouldve moved five feet to the right and yelled at the girl to sit on the stone bench
its some trees presumably you thought they looked nice because fall colours and wanted to capture that you may or may not have thought you were clever for including other red things in the frame  its poorly executed because you couldnt be bothered to take like 2 steps backwards and get the edges of the trees in frame you did no editing at all so it just looks like a dull straightoutofcamera image and theres nothing really going on in terms of composition  also you scrub your exif like a douche and you make threads for single images dont do those things
this is what you see on the way to take photos of other stuff
  it almost looks like a snapshot
  one of the worst pictures ive ever seen
  a perfect picture it captures the fading way of american life perfectly the trees that represent the liberators of the americas bolivar washington san martin and also masculinity because of their vertical structure the three trees also inherently inscribe religion into the frame and by this they also call on the horschamp an absolute offscreen behind the picture these trees were once proud and had significant colors but now they are withering away diluting their greatness and they cant even stand by themselves anymore needing the help of wooden structures  which also brings us back to the conflict of man against technology this can further be seen in the empty spaces the shopping center and the woman with no identity  as an undecipherable minority  blankly stares into the distance longing for more consumerism as a final thought the way the trees are presented shows the subjugation of our nature and man under the cruelty of the capitalistic machine something that was supposed to give us happiness has left us empty and sad    good work anon keep it up
  its shit  sorry i usually refrain from posting negative comments but since you asked for a honest opinion sorry that thing is awful    lighting is too cold and bland for those red leaves framing is awful cropping the sides of the trees looks like you tried to use a lens that is too long for the subject being photographed vertical orientation only makes it worse the building in background looks ugly compared to the trees i personally would rather use a telephoto if available and get a close shot of some of the leaves with sky as background instead of trying to fit everything and the ugly building in a the same frame    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makenikon corporationcamera modelnikon d3200camera softwaredarktable 244maximum lens aperturef/65sensing methodonechip color areacolor filter array pattern22810focal length 35mm equiv330 mmimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandimage created20181109 151453exposure time1/200 secfnumberf/180exposure programmanualiso speed rating200exposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flashfocal length22000 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width1440image height960renderingnormalexposure modemanualscene capture typestandardgain controlnonecontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormalsubject distance rangeunknowniso speed used200image qualityrawwhite balanceautofocus modemanualflash compensation00 eviso speed requested200flash bracket compensation00 evae bracket compensation00 evlens typeunknownlens range1000  2900 mm f/56  f/6shooting/bracketing modesingle frame/offnoise reductionoffcamera actuations12119

  agreed

are they a meme
  yes but if by some accident you bump the front of your lens it could help    dont waste your time otherwise
  same reason i have mine keeps glass safe and filter ring dent free
  its also easier to change a dirty uv filter than to properly clean the front element
      spotted the filter salesmen
  for film uv filter does make a difference for digital it does nothing    protection filter shields front element and filter ring from small bumps scratches and dirt its fully optional if you have a expensive fancy lens i might one day want to purchase slightly scratched but rrreally cheap do not use one
i have one on my pancake lens for when i dont use a lens hood for maximum flatness
  i honestly havent seen a different on using one on film
  difference is visible when shooting things like daytime landscapes with film if sun is low enough as it should for muh golden hour its slight or nonexistent
 also for bw film one might use a yellow filter in such situation and maybe a skylight filter for color daytime mountains beaches snow in early middle ages i used to have a skylight filter on me slr permanently slightly less haze at distance for uv same  bit warming with skylight 1a    anyway filters can help with film in some situations but are not required if you are satisfied without
  how do some film makers capture blue and orange light so well in some movies is it all post process or is there a filter they use to bring out orange and blue    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2014 macintoshimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage created20150604 132456color space informationsrgbimage width1000image height584
  nah the whole teal/orange thing isnt done with filters its just colour grading footage from expensive cine cameras
  i use them for diy projects the main problem i have with all lens filters is that they add glare/flare or reduce contrast      that shit makes me fucking puke
  raw video  colour grading
  what about this do they shoot their film at like f 14 and get the starlights or is this post processing as well or is there like a filter to bring out the light i wanted to do this for a photoshoot next month since the hurricane murked my clients house it might be 2 months from now

  that shit makes me fucking puke    that color grading is based and redpilled    what makes me puke is when action movies just increase saturation by 500 and add a yellow warm filter
digital sensors have uv filter built in for analogue idk im too poor for analogue    protection wise i read that cheap uv filters degrade image quality more than lens scratches so i dont use them i guess if i had 1000 euro lens then a 100 euro filter maybe doesnt degrade the quality as much as cheap filters but for me makes no sense to stick a 100 euro filter in 100 euro lens
  anamorphic lenses are known for their streaking flares youre going to have a hard time emulating it on a stills camera either due to price impracticality or mount incompatibility  real standalone anamorphic lenses cost more than a nice car for some reason you wont be adapting their mounts to dslrs some anamorphics you can mount on top of a 50mm lens and get like a 35mm ish horizontal fov but its almost completely impractical focusing wise etc there are some hackish gimmicky filters that attach like fishing line across the filter which can give you flares like that    however for filmic look id look at very mild diffusion filters like a light tiffen promist theoretical fairly cheap and will reduce harsh contrast in your image and give bright lights a bit of glow around them i will reduce clarity but for some shots it works wonders
  ah that sucks i guess ill save up for the anthropromorthic rig and ill shoot some shorts with my friend on youtube or something
  that color grading is based and redpilled  no its not its overdone to shit and looks bad literally the same thing as hdr
  teal and orange is so trendy on instagram right now its almost painful people really do just want to be part of the crowd and take no risks i guess
  unless youre in very sandy/dusty conditions just use the lens hood no filter with help if you drop your camera
  there was one crappy film about moses and all they used was a strong orange or blue filter  when the orange was being used it was supposed to signify daytime or when near a fire and the blue was used for all the other night shots
  heard even of cases where it saved 2k worth of lenses as it dropped filter shattered lens was ok but thats not the main reason for using them they protect against scratches few miniscule problems on the front lens will devalue it considerably with uv filter youll rarely even need to clean main element
  few miniscule problems on the front lens will devalue it considerably    well sure if you care more about selling your lenses than using them
  as a former camera salesman who worked at a shop with a service centre i have a few things to say about filters  1 the salesman often makes more money selling you a 50 filter than a 2000 camera   2 a cheap filter will negatively affect your images through flair ghosting and softness  3 i have seen more filters damage front elements than accidental taps or bumps a hit that might not otherwise damage the lens can send glass shards into the front element of the lens   4 filters do often save filter threads on the lens by taking the hit   5 brass rings are superior to aluminum   from what i have seen you are probably better off by taking the glass out of a uv filter and just putting a brass filter ring on the front of your lens    a lens hood will often do the same thing
i got one for my macro lens because i thought id be very close to my subject  a lens hood probably offers the same level of protection
  ill just presume this is about filters on the whole for digital cameras where the uv bit doesnt matter at all and youre basically just using it for protection    if youre a pro and need the optimal image quality its simple just get insurance and only put on a filter in dangerous environments like sand or salty water    if like me and presumably most people here you take pictures for fun just get a filter and dont obsess about iq  1 its a transparent lens cap when you pull your camera out of your bag dont have to first put it away somewhere but can immediately start shooting  2 it cleans off easier than a convex surface  3 while most scratches on a lens front element dont matter much optically if youre planning on ever selling the lens they very much do most buyers are willing to look past a few scuffs on the lens body but once theres a scratch on that front element the price drops significantly  this is for modern lenses for old ones cleaning marks are so common that most buyers do not care
  that color grading is based and redpilled    you are fucking delusional or just came out of a film class on color theory which is more delusional it is worse than dogshit
  a lens hood will often do the same thing    came here to post this they protect everything and enhance the photo instead of degrade it
  nothing good comes from the hood
  anamorphic lenses compress the image giving you depending on the compressing factor standard is 2x a wider horizontal aov while keeping the vertical matting on the other hand would keep the horizontal but changing the vertical  same fov  85mm  2x anamorphic 3262  vaov of 85mm haov of 425mm  matted 425mm 32 cropped to 62  vaov 85 haov 425  a 85 18 lens has a much larger aperture than a 425 18 thus the anamorphic setup will always give you shallower dof    the method of compressing the image creates oval shaped bokeh oval lights and waterfall outoffocus as well as horizontal flares old anamorphic lenses also have serious barell distortion modern ones like the zeiss master anamorphics have nearly no distortion and are coated so well to barely flare at all 40000 per lens most anamorphic characteristics of old lenses are flaws but became something we became used to in films and therefore see as cinematic    budget version would be eg an anamorphic projecting lens like isco ultra star but first its sold way overpriced now a days second it has serious usability issues since it was never meant to shoot trough the compression factor changes while focusing close focus is only 15m needs 0x diopter to get closer and you need to focus the projector lens and the taking lens on the camera to match means focusing takes some time and racking focus is impossible single focus solutions cost 500 upwards and consist of basicly to diopters in reverse the glass element of the taking lens has to be smaller then the rear glas of the adapter and it can only be used with tele lenses to not vignette like 70mm on fullframe making wide angle shots imposible because its heavy you need to rig it because it has no filter thread you have to make your own or buy and expensive clamp    avoid slr magic and anamorphic shop in this regards their anamorphots are way overpriced and not very good same goes for their single focus solution
  jesus christ this was amazingly informative yet horribly depressing
  didnt want to depress you but just show the limitations because it can be very expensive and remorsfull if it doesnt work out as you would like to  if you can work with those limitations you can still produce very great footage    i had the luck of getting an ultra star for cheap off ebay in a forum for cinema projecting built a rig with smallrig parts and tried shooting with my dslr it was so hard to get the shot in focus because in the ovf i couldnt tell if it was actually in focus or not with the lcd i had no focus peaking or anything had to manually zoom into the image and judge it this way worked but not as easy tried it on a a7ii once and was a little bit easier with focus peaking automatic focus magnification and evf soon have the chance to try it again maybe continous af can automatically match the focus when i focus the adapter but dunno could report back if interested  with shallow dof you should keep the distance and because the rig was quite heavy shooting without tripod i could only do so for a little amount off time probably applies to any filmmaking camera rig though also if you shoot on a glidecam on which you cant rack focus  the shots i got in focus were tack sharp though there you see why those projector lenses once cost 20003000    if you dont want to shoot wide open so you have a greater dof plane to work with you may as well just get a wider lens and matte it you wont get the oval bokeh lens flares and horizontal barrel distortion though oval bokeh can be faked like anything    but only works with longer lenses to not vignette and only wide open distortion can also be faked which brings me to another characteristic if you rack an older real anamorphic lens it has some weird shift on the size of in and out of focus areas    another modern projecting lens would be the schneider cinelux if you want more vintage characteristics which flare you should look into older onces though
  1 the salesman often makes more money selling you a 50 filter than a 2000 camera    so thats why all camera online shops in my country have a text bubble next to the cameras saying dont forget the uv filter d
  oval shaped bokeh    this is the most disgusting thing i have ever seen in my entire life it makes hollywood movies look like they were filmed on a cellphone from 2009

  this    theres a reason most lenses will come with a lens hood but not a uv filter that hasnt been normal since the 60s when it really was relevant for shooting film in my experience a decent lens hood does just as well protecting the front element and filter threads against nonmoisture or projectile related perils i could see using a filter if it was required for weather sealing and if you really must keep the lens pristine go for it most of my lenses are over 10 years old anyway so that doesnt matter to me
    its not supposed to look crispy     you pixel peeping sharp at any cost guys would have been very unhappy back in the days of film
  ah yes film crack sip
    eh push processing to get intentionally grainy pics was just the way it was now you push the iso to get a similar effect and somehow youre the devil

  why not use both filters make cleaning lenses very easy as you dont have to be worried of scratching the lens you can be as straight forward with any type of cloth as you want    hoyas which cost 4050 dollars locally can found for 10 on ebay pop one on when you buy a new lens and you will never have to clean the real lens underneath nor does it gather dust    i used to only use lens hoods but the ease of cleaning really got me into filters
  just so you know there are lenses that are legitimately that big too ive got a 55/12 and a 1740/4 that both have huge front elements
  filters make cleaning lenses very easy as you dont have to be worried of scratching the lens  i never got this argument  are you guys lens merchants or what    filters are easier to scratch through cleaning than lenses what am i supposed to do then buy a new filter whenever they get microscratches  or put up with the microscratches  if tiny scratches on the filter dont bother me and i shoot through it why would they bother me on the lens    i second hoods  much better protection from hits and they actually improve image quality rather than degrade it plus theyre cheaper to begin with
  before i got into photography  smaller real top lens further inside  id say youre still not into photography
  1/8  any particular reason you chose 1/8 instead of say 1/4  is there anything i should be aware of when using one of these things something that needs to be compensated for in settings to ensure exposure isnt fucky    i really like the black warm promist too
  any particular reason you chose 1/8 instead of say 1/4  1/8 is more subtle so i can leave it on my lens anytime but i also never tried the 1/4     is there anything i should be aware  i dont think so just shoot as always the filter only makes your photos more soft and blures the light a bit
  front element if you like the word more
  right look at mister pedantic over there insisting that it be called a front element instead of just a top lens he probably also insists it has to be called a photographic lens instead of just glass a flash instead of sparklebrighter and a camera instead of just a clicky piccy box like who does he think he is the queen
  do you use filters to protect your lens from all that salt
  your lens is more expensive than a filter and if you screw on a filter upon unboxing a new lens it would basically remain pristine foreverso i get the argument but i rarely use them myself not that i ever had a new lens
  after looking at this grid i watched all of those movies last night drunk off my ass and dragonball evolution somehow got worse with beergoggles on i forgot how hot alba was and spiderman i saved for last and that was a good movie
  lol
  if you screw on a filter upon unboxing a new lens it would basically remain pristine forever  yeah i get that  but what im saying is this is only of concern if youre sell your lenses frequently and even then i doubt a pristine lens and one with some tiny abrasions from cleaning will be more than 50 of difference in the used market  unless its a collectible and many people throw as much on a damn uv filter
  cant debate that but in the end it is about putting a physical barrier between the lens and the outside so theres no use spending top dollar on a filter unless it interferes with the image quality ill absolutely agree with you on that
  no
redpilled    what does that even fucking mean in this context

  only if you develop and scan them yourself     the upcharges that modern boutique labs have for the dumbest simple shit like processing disposable cameras or scanning half frame/panoramic is a huge scam yes charging a teenager 50 to process and scan a roll of film will definitely keep film alive    labs recycle the cameras and send them back to the manufacturer and get money so it literally costs them less to develop a disposable camera than a normal roll of film but most of them charge 510 more    disposable cameras are fun and have a look but theyre overpriced nowadays anyway

i tried increasing the saturation but it doesnt seem to do anything
  but it looks classy to desaturate a little up the clarity and crush the blacks
warm take even though ken does it to a comical degree saturated/vibrant colours dont deserve anywhere near the level of hate they get here

  wtf do you have to be jewish to work there
  because thats how jewish people opperate movie industry is the same way banking is the same way court system is the same way bh actually got sued for their hiring practices and they still keep doing it
  i actually work in hollywood im not really shocked at this point except that store seems to be mandatory to wear a yamika man why do they have to be annoying as fuck
    they got sued for their hiring practices  they got sued again for segregating bathrooms from nonjewish employees  its insane theyre a great retailer but christ
  bathrooms from nonjewish employees  so you would essentially get your own private bathroom not bad
    thank you for this now i can finally stop supporting those kikes
  my pleasure friend
  but christ  sir please leave the premises such language is not tolerated at bh
    he needs to support his ever growing family
  the only jew ken can get along with is fro
  notaljews
i like that ken is just some dorky dad engineer that likes camera    his positivism actually inspires me to just take photos and not give a shit
  so you would essentially get your own private bathroom not bad  not exactly they prevented nonjewish employees from using the normal bathrooms or made them us lessthanstandard bathrooms if i remember correctly
  where are you guys getting the jew angle from everywhere i heard about it it was just white vs hispanic is this some epic /pol/ troll
  guess it was hispanic then    is this some epic /pol/ troll  fuck off pancake fag
  claims bh are part of some jewish conspiracy  no source or reason for believing that  gets proved wrong  le ebin pancake  leave this board pls
  tfw low sat low cont yellow tint
  theyre closed like every other week for some bullshit jewish holiday
  different person but ive been to their warehouse at the naval yard in brooklyn they are all hasidic jews there all hasidic jews in their stores jews own and run it they are the ultra conservative jews with the hair side burns things and the hats there is a huge population of hasidic jews around williamsburg brooklyn its not a conspiracy lol there is just a fuck ton of them there and they started a business
  crush them blacks thats what ive been saying for years
  white vs hispanic  jews arent white

  the most /p/ country  basementland

america
  the one you have with you
  it used to be the go to place for painters/photogs  yeah in 19th century van gogh specifically ditched that polluted and flat shithole to find some colour
  definitely not where i live
  where do you live
  theres plenty of color here now       japan almost anything in africa norway rural china    its a bit of a dumb question though because you can find great spots in any country but i guess were really trying to turn this into some /int/ shit throwing contest so might as well go ahead with the thanks muhammads 56 and whatever else    the whole point is to go somewhere figure out whats nice about the place and take pics of what you like

  dude i already know
  did you just use instagram
  well i took both those photos bud
  this has an exaggerated feel to me where the extra effort doesnt seem to bring any merit its a clean shot seemingly without flaws but i ask myself whats the point its boring and the bland background add to this feel what do mirror clothing posture and expression tell me and where is the connection of these take  for an example the execution regarding the light is worse however the idea is good still face and hands get some light and despite that the chest seems a bit dimmer than the face the rope gives a feel of depth and she seems to act with the environment as she pays attention to her hand grabbing a key my eye first finds her face as there are the highlights foregroundcolor red and good contrast her sight leads me to her left hand and the rope further leads me to her right hand a triangle is often used in composition such a triangle is formed with her hands and face both triangle and depth add to the composition
  as i said i took both those
  does not change anything understand the statement instead of reacting defiantly     is meant to reply to   is a repost correcting typos
  im saying you are reading far to into shit man
  theres a lot of cultural reference related subtext here that you seem to be missing
  i rarely read but i face the criticisms that i get from peers and i try to understand why photos are successful or why i like a specific one how do you distinguish a good photo from a bad one
  please tell me why
  do you like it or not easy as that
  so how do you improve if you dont like a shot do something random until youre satisfied

    i guess terry richardson closes down his shots to at least f/63 as the environment light is rather dim and the strobe light rather bright/harsh
    also lower your iso speed the strobes are key light in richardsons and not fill
  thank you i have another shoot this week and ill try that out

an a6000 with a decent lens then make something out of your life
go digital mf and you have a head start
  then make something out of your life  you mean like becoming a professional photographer
leica m10 and 50mm noctilux lets see if your parents love you enough
  i could probably get a new truck for the same amount but i really dont need another truck is that actually good shit or is it just a meme tho
  if thats what you after i more meant following a hobby might help you to pursue a career though
  i unironically think i would like to be a cinematographer i took an intro to film studies class my senior year in high school and used to take a lot of photos videos with my moms boomer camera and i would spend a lot of time editing im not a total beginner to photography and i would like some more professional equipment just so my work isnt sneezed at the project i really want to work on now is a documentary about zoos in america and a series of reviews of those various zoos aquariums and museums with animals on display for a fee if this thread doesnt die young ill find her camera and show yall some photos i took at the local zoo here
  that sounds nice get a gimbal and a manual lens with the a6000 and get going if you actually find yourself filming over a certain period sell the stuff and get a cine equipment    i wouldnt ask for a multithousand dollar equipment if i were unsure about my motivation though
  its a meme get a sony a7iii or fuji xt3 instead
if you want rational normal people to love you get a fuji a sony a6000 screams autist to most except a handful of malcontents on this board a fuji xe3 with 27mm f28 pancake will ensure more people than just mummy and daddy will love you trust me
  how is the a6000 an autist camera it looks like it takes bretty gud photos
  horrible ergonomics and button placements  ridiculously designed menu system with 10000 pages of guff to go through  apsc emount abandoned for full frame apart from sigma   needs a battery grip to feel comfortable pinky falls off the bottom of the camera unless youre a manlet with tiny hands  looks like an autistic playstation camera    people only like the a6000 if theyve never used any other camera in their lives and have nothing to compare it to which explains all the noob shills around here who bought an a6000 as their first camera
  oh and overheating after 15 minutes of video recording
  apsc emount abandoned for full frame apart from sigma    complains about ff support on emount  recommends a fuji
  not like anybody can afford any sony lenses around here most people are stuck on the kit lens or using mouldy vintage lenses on chink adapters
  the noctilux might be meme but an m10 and a 35mm summilux is going to serve him well
  nobody mentions nikon d850
  a disposable camera from walmart
  horrible ergonomics and button placements    what shit feels fine
  manlet detected
  sausage fingered yank detected
  i am a neet with rich parents what should i ask them for christmas    canon eos 4000d and dont forget your uv filter
contax g2 and shit tons of film stocks
  i was in your situation for my birthday and i got a nikon d750
  fuji xt3    goty camera all years
  i want to get into photography  nope your gear will collect dust most of the time
a disposable rite aid camera and a big ol jug of bleach
  i have the d850  i wouldnt recommend it to a new photographer    no flash for fill flash  no auto mode i know i know but im reminded every time i hand my camera to a noob that there isnt a quick way to get to an easy mode that anyone can run  no cheap good vr kit lens 2485 vr maybe    if i was starting new with no existing shit  z6  2470 f4  ftz adapter  50 14g  sb5000
  dont listen to anyone here im the same as you get a d800/e and a 35mm f/2 its a great duo and youll look cool when taking photos i wish i had that but i have a d700
  d700 is coolest nigon

sony breaks international law and nuts over all the competition before november ends    16 bit stills    4k 60fps 12 bit video    not being sold to nikon fuji pentax    lmfao canikon in straightjackets suicide watch would be too much work
  nobody cares faggot take it to the /shill/ thread
  16 bit sensor  what the fuck they are stepping on phase ones toes now    you literally had to pay 30 000 usd for the phase one 100 mp digital back just to get that privilege in the past
who really needs that much camera tho
find me a sensor which delivers better results with 16 bit adc than 14 bit adc and ill be amazed  this is effectively a purely marketing driver gimmick two more bits to record random noise  the only reason medium format systems have 16 bit adc is because people wanted to see the bigger number even if for some reason a 16 bit adc might perform better than a 14 bit adc there really is very little reason to store it in the file  then again sony does no packing on uncompressed raw so filesize will be the same for 14 bit raw and 16 bit raw  which meme manufacturer will put this on their camera feature list
  sony has been increasing the raw throughput bandwidth as an alternative to global shutter technology    so now they are apparently so freaking fast they dont know what to do with all that speed so they increase to colour resolution    what really surprise me is this one  8k30p12bit  what the actual fuck they didnt even want to give us 10 bit in the past    but we made so much fun of them that they probably felt they had something to prove
  go back to  faggot
  silly goose you dont even know what colour filters they will be using    they have patent designs for a foveonlike filter array and not just that they have the prototypes made and scanned under electron microscope as well
  ok find me a monochrome sensor which benefits from 16 bit over 14 bit can you find a buzzword free example why would 16 bit be a benefit
  monochrome sensor  foveon isnt monochrome
  why would more bandwidth be beneficial    dude just read an intro to electronics book your smarmy questions just out you as an uneducated fool
  yes fun you found a gimmick patent you arent going to get a higher quality signal than from a monochrome setup if you cant benefit from 16 bit adc vs 14 bit on monochrome you cant on a system like foveon either
  you dont have infinite data you need to capture do you also believe it makes sense to have audio as 24 bit 192khz this is something they sell people on because they want higher numbers too
  have you never seen a need for 2 extra stops of dr 2 stops better low light performance or 2 stops faster shutter speed      24 192 is awesome if you have decent enough gear to show it off 16 44 sounds like cancer and i can blind a/b it 100 of the time you probably cant as i bet your hifi cost less than a grand and came from a big box company
  the human eye cant see more than 30 fps    this is how stupid you come across
  lets just say i remain highly skeptical or retards who continuously claim sensor technology cant improve    nothing has given me reason to change my mind so far
this is just marketing fap to give fanbois and other faggots an erection     it will sell to the converted but it will do nothing to improve anyones photography and its users still wont win any significant awards because the camera is so much better than canikon    to be perfectly honest it just smells like sony shitting the bed because canikon are munching on their market s
  sony make big tech advances and lock the competition out    who needs technological progress its never done anytging for anyone    oh bitter anti sony niggees never change
  the levels of postpurchase rationalisation from nikon z6/canon r early adopters once sony release much highercapacity cameras for less money and with a more developed lens ecosystem are going to destroy this board im calling it now    before anyone calls me a sony shill i started with canon and shoot primarily with nikon fmount glass
sensor  its going to be outdated in less than 2 years enjoy your consumer goods plebs
  oh the bitter af anti sony crowd are going to get vocal    im especially looking forward to fuji and nikon fans sitting smugly thinking this will trickle down to them in the next 1 to 2 years only for them to release models with old gimped sensors for at least the next 5 or until sony isnt a monopoly holder any more    casual reminder that sony havent even sold their first stacked sensor yet which has been out for 2 years    burst rate video bandwidth dynamic range price lenses battery tech colour science is there anything that sony isnt dominating the market at right now
  fucking sonygger
cant you fucks contain this shit to the gear threads
  this kind of shift in quality hasnt been seen since we ditched ccd this is more than just gear this is the future of digital photogaraphu
  guy youre replying to ergonomics sony cameras are a pain in the ass to shoot with on full manual my habit of using old adapted lenses mitigates some of that having direct focus zoom and aperture control through the lens but their grips dials button placements etc are complete shit i wouldnt want them to drop the squaredoff aesthetic and start pumping out collapsed polygonlooking things like canikon but they could definitely learn from how those companies and fuji design grips lay out dials etc    hell they might actually be getting worse at it over time the nex7 was a more comfortable camera to operate than the a6xxx series their menus are garbage too
  90 are going to keep using their smartphones though
  bullshit    the full frame sonys are far better ergo than anything fuji produce right now
  24 192 is awesome if you have decent enough gear to show it off 16 44 sounds like cancer and i can blind a/b it 100 of the time    no you dont unless your ears have suffered a mutation which allows you to hear ultrasounds you dont if they did then you could be making millions by being a test subject for scientific experiments        most likely what you actually hear in your 24bit audio is distortion only proving point against 24/192 even forwarder      
  says the guy whos film is 20 years outdated
  fujis dont have a grip i dont seen how u can argue for that
  still gives better tones and highlight detail   im not against digital but keeping up with latest developments in digital photography is a rat race just dont want to play that game
  sony cameras are a pain in the ass to shoot with on full manual  i have no problem shooting full manual on my a7 iii     but their grips   i hold an a7 iii with a 70200mm f/28 gm and canon 200mm f/2 for hours at a time when shooting sports and wildlife ive never once had hand fatigue nor felt that the rubber material is too slippery     dials button placements   if youre used to another cameras layout thats fine but dont imply that this is some inherent flaw i shot canon for a decade before switching to sony given the smaller size of the sony body i cant imagine having good workflow with a canon button arrangement on it     ive had my hands on a few fujis and theres no way i would ever use one on the job cool cameras but the top dials slow me down they might be ok in fixedlighting situations
  hard to hold  bad menus    yeah i watched those youtube videos too
  casual reminder that sony havent even sold their first stacked sensor yet which has been out for 2 years  anon it just means the technology was too expensive or that fukon were too cheapass to pay for the tech
okay so the source is mistral apparently he knows his shit so its probably legitimate    this will be available to the others in theory but in practice they wont be able to afford it with th way sony semiconductors business model works  you dont just pay for the sensor you pay for the feature    16bit colour channel  8k30p12bit  8k60p10bit  onchip pdaf  each of these features will be locked by default and you have to cough up the license cost to unlock it  and trust me it will be veeeeeeeery expensive to unlock the 16bit license sony isnt an affordable foundry they are expensive as fuck to order from    most likely phase one will remain the only customer who orders the 16 bit license and their pricing to recoup from the license cost is through the roof  and sony imaging too of course they are the only exception among the current market who can get 16 bit for cheap since they are the sister company to the foundry
  reeee why dont they just buy sigma and make foveon great again
  reminder that everyone iit is a  tard who doesnt own a camera
should i sell my a7iii
  16 bit sensor  this is one of those things that sounds impressive but wont actually be a big deal in practice     its the difference between slicing a color into 214 shades or 216 so instead of 16386 shades each of green blue and red youll have 65536 put another way itll be able to record about 280000000000000 colors instead of 4380000000000     both of those numbers are several orders of magnitude above what your monitor can display your printer can print unless youre printing insanely large or your meaty face orbs can distinguish like its hard for human eyeballs to distinguish between a hundred shades of green much less sixteen thousand much less sixtyfive thousand     so the main effect of 16 bit capture will be to make sonys spec sheet look more impressive while taking longer to process and making every photo you take take up extra hard drive space i cant think of any realworld situation where it would even be noticeable
  nah if sony release a camera with 16 bit colour it will be priced around the a9 territory expect 4000 dollars at a minimum    7iii will still be the bargain of the year
  unfortunately sigma doesnt know what pdaf is  thats why people buy from the big 3    they dont know what the fuck is video either so their cameras cant do video very well  foveon means you need to process 3 times the amount of data compared to bayer and their technology just isnt up to par
  8k60p  youre gonna need an atomos ninja with a 1tb ssd to get that going
  id imagine this would help with bringing out details in shadows and highlights
  why do you assume monitor and printing tech is going to remain static
    because it has been for like thirty years the absolute best monitor technology is still only 10 bit i would wager that 95 of monitors today cant reproduce all of the 8bit rgb spectrum which is actually a step down from my crt i had in 1998
  youre underestimating the smartphones they are pushing the industry forwards like never before
  why do you assume monitor and printing tech is going to remain static  mostly because i assume eyeball tech is going to remain static     based on some quick googling the human eye can perceive around 710 million different colors lets take that high number so 10 million     your computer generally operated in 24 bit color which is actually 8 bits per color channel that means your computer can display 224 or around 16 million colors meaning that your computer can show about six million extra shades that your dumb squishy human eyes can actually tell apart     now when were talking about 16 bit image capture that doesnt mean that its less than the 24 bit color your monitor can show you because that 16 bits is per channel so in equivalent terms after bayer that would be 48 bit color each extra bit doubles the color resolution meaning that a 16 bit capture would put each debayered pixel as one of 248 different colors     so around 281474976711000 give or take a thousand because my calculator app only has so much precision     so that is a few hundred trillion more shades of color than your eyeballs can deal with and your monitor would need to advance about seven orders of magnitude to accommodate it even though it can already display more colors than your eyes can distinguish     so yeah monitors will get better but its still a waste of everyones time and effort
  youre so stupid increasing the bit depth will give more color info making it easier to color grade
  have you ever felt stymied by the mere 14 bits per channel that current cameras offer    have you ever looked at a photo and thought to yourself man if only that had been taken on a camera with more bits per pixel it would be good    can you honestly think of a real world situation where this will make any visible difference at all
spectrum of visible light 740nm to 380nm  740380360nm  my camera right now12bit4096 levels per pixel  16bit65535  what makes anyone assume 16bit is most useful to a bunch of sperglords with cameras i mean i know the sperglords will assume its for them but its much more useful for astronomy/space/aeronautical/military/science  but sure if you want to make a consumer camera that can be selectively tuned into the uv and ir part of the spectrum ill consider its merits
    what a cuck argument
  i wouldnt know ive only experienced 14 but imagine you only took jpegs at 8bit depth and you thought that was just good enough you just dont know what youre missing out on 16 could be much better
  16 could be much better  i owned a 12bit rebel xti when i first started out and later upgraded it to the 14bit 40d the difference in image quality was basically nil     later i got a 5d classic which gave me noticeably better image quality than the 40d and was again a 12bit camera    nowadays i shoot with a 5d mark iii 16 bit the change in bit depth has no affect on my photos lots of other things about the 5d3 improved my photos like being able to shoot in much lower light better autofocus better controls etc but not the increase in bit depth    its unlikely that adding a couple more extraneous bits will have any affect
  the difference in image quality was basically nil  you might not be pushing your raw files that far then the type of photography that you do might not really need that extra information then again very few people might actually benefit from it but clearly youre complaining simply because its sony if canon announced that you would be diamonds right now just be happy that there is serious advancement happening in digital photography between the manufactures because that means the consumer will win when theres competition
   but clearly youre complaining simply because its sony  nah im not really even complaining im just trying to point out that this isnt really that big a deal definitely not as one person in the thread put it  this kind of shift in quality hasnt been seen since we ditched ccd this is more than just gear this is the future of digital photogaraphu  from     thats just ridiculous its an upgrade that no one is ever going to notice other than in arguments online like this one    and im not a kneejerk anti sony canonfag over here i also own a nexc3 a57 a6000 and a7 ii when i bought the a7 ii i legitimately thought it might be good enough to replace my 5d3 it wasnt sonys totally owning everyone else in the specsheet competition but theyre lagging badly behind in the actuallymakingausablecamera department
  i dont know why you think the cameras arent usable ive had the original a7r for the past 4 or 5 years now and think its fine
  we have entered a weird junction in time where sony actually beats canon/nikon mirrorless in battery life jpeg colours af general image quality
  but its always something with canon and nikon users remember a few years ago when they complained about battery life that was fixed then they complained about no joystick fixed then no touchscreen then bad color science then bad af evf lag all fixed there will always be something to complain about but at this point its useless complaining the only complaints at this point are bad menus which is a meme at best anyone with half a brain can scroll through a menu and read the functions and no articulating screen which could be justifiable i would like that but come on
  it used to be true but its just funny how everything has reversed in 1 generation    i also feel the dslr makers have deliberately crippled their mirrorless hence helping sony getting ahead  definitely bad decision making because sony will only fix up more and more stuff and get even stronger next gen
  i dont know why you think the cameras arent usable ive had the original a7r for the past 4 or 5 years now and think its fine  its not that theyre not usable its that other cameras are a lot more usable      we have entered a weird junction in time where sony actually beats canon/nikon mirrorless in battery life   i mean maybe with the new ztype batteriesi havent tried embut certainly not with the older batteries like its not even close i take a slow photo walk with my sony and pop off less than a hundred photos and its down to 50 by the time i get home with any of my dslrs i can shoot hundreds of photos a day over the course of a week and not get down to 50 running a full frame sensor every second youre framing a shot drains the battery like a motherfucker  jpeg colours   well thats awesome for ken rockwell  af   the face detect is nice but there needs to be a way to quickly override that when it messes upwhich it does frequentlythat doesnt involve menu diving even with one of the custom buttons set to pull up the facedetect menu i still have to turn that off then select another spot to autofocus on which is at least two buttons because theres not a direct way to select af points then more buttons to turn it back on again afterwards     on my canon theres a joystick that lets me directly select which af point i want to use and it remembers what af point ive selected based on orientation of the camera which it apparently took sony seven generations of a7 to add even though canon and nikon had this feature back in 2012   general image quality  i havent noticed any significant difference between my a7ii and 5diii in terms of image quality other than that the a7ii is about a stop noisier at all isos maaaaybe its gotten significantly better with the latest generation but dpreviews studio tool says that theyre about on par not pulling forward
  i mean maybe with the new ztype batteriesi havent tried  thats the case the situation is reversed 180 degrees    canikon was not prepared for the 7iii  they wont be prepared for the siii or 7iv either    the face detect is nice  people just turn that off altogether and engage the eyeaf button then needed
  on my canon theres a joystick that lets me directly select which af point i want to use  right now canon is the company who doesnt have a joystick    you wont like the eos r if that was your thing
  you wont like the eos r if that was your thing  yeah im skipping the eos r and waiting for them to come out with something more 5dlike in handling
  maybe with the new ztype batteries  i get between 650 and 750 shots out of my npfz100 batteries
  thats only is you shoot with flash every 30 second or so    in practice you can easily get twice that over the course of the day
  that isnt my experience with these batteries after about 750 frames its time to switch out
  nyquist human hearing limit other bullshit    all completely outdated notions of how out hearing works    humans can only hear up to 20k so sampling twice per revolution is acceptable    ok so this would be the equivalent of limiting a photo to just 2 shades of gray and saying thats fine which it clearly isnt    also human hearing may only be noticeable up to 20k but phase information which translates into better imaging runs all the way up to around 100khz 192 still loses phase information a fresh vinyl from an original master should have high frequency detail up to around 60khz and is the best medium still before you get to reel to reel
  i dont really care either way but these kinds of arguments especially from canikon users can fuck off     progress is great for the consumer
  well shilled mr shill sir
  8k60p10bit  this is bullshit and you know it to be true  above all imagine the fucking file size and the speed it would require to manage that data flow anyone with functioning brain knows its bs
  ok so this would be the equivalent of limiting a photo to just 2 shades of gray and saying thats fine which it clearly isnt  hey how many different shades of gray can an individual grain of a black and white film stock be
  hur durrr cheering for progress from any company means shill    the absolute state of /p/
  caring this much about the progress of specs even tho current specs are fair beyond what any consumer would need  the absolute state of /p/haggots oh wait i mean /g/tards
    i cant believe the level of stupidity/cope you would need to be on to believe that technology is going to remain static in todays age for whatever reason given the current advances in immersive vr etc theres very well likely applications for this higher level of technology that people havent even thought of yet but that will make it an absolute necessity going forward
  great so you identified that this only works when you want to achieve a specific aesthetic to arbitrarily limit all your photos to this because thats the maximum information your eye can process is clearly bullshit and thus you defeated your own argument
  all completely outdated notions of how out hearing works  according to who your hifi salesman or maybe some recent test done by an independent lab whos director happens to be friends with some snakeoil hifi company    ok so this would be the equivalent of limiting a photo to just 2 shades of gray and saying thats fine which it clearly isnt  you obviously dont understand the concept of dithering read     also human hearing may only be noticeable up to 20k but phase information which translates into better imaging  i will be honest and say i dont understand what you mean by phase information both stereo channels should always be in phase assuming both channels run from the same clock but maybe im missing something but again even assuming that phase information is lost theres no scientific evidence that such difference can be perceived by human listeners many formal tests have been done and all of them show that a human cannot tell the difference from clean 24/192 and 16/441    a fresh vinyl from an original master should have high frequency detail up to around 60khz  you obviously have no idea how music is mixed and mastered do you      and is the best medium still before you get to reel to reel  topkek
  i have a bsc in audio technology and digital signals theres maybe 30 people a year that take this course worldwide and ive been using this knowledge as a commercial consultant for nearly a decade     what are your credentials my dude
  i feel like you didnt understand my point at all     the technology is already better than our eyeballs there is no benefit to making it better were past the point of diminishing returns and into the realm of literally zero returns and youre saying we need to go several orders of magnitude beyond that just cause     something like this could have benefits for scientific/industrial imaging but doesnt actually provide a benefit to photography where the end goal is to reproduce it for a human eyeball
  idk what a bsc is but whatever degree you got im sure they didnt teach you the bs you spout in your early comments and im also pretty sure they teach you that you should always filter all unnecessary frequencies from an audio signal    who ever yourre a consultant for im sorry for them they probably believe the bullshit you say and pay you for it    seriously know im not retarded enough to think sony pays people to shill on 4chan but if i thought they did it would explain a lot of things

  wtf i love sony
  how do you not understand its not about how much our eyes can see its about having that extra data making the image more capable of postprocessing
  idk what a bsc is    well that says all that needs to be said    you shoukd always filter unnecessary frequencies    lol wut if its there in the recording its supposed to be there if it gets removed that is a subjective artistic choice    why did you decide to double down on embarassing yourself fair enough you couldnt have foreseen that i would literally be one of the most learned people in the world for audio and digital signals but to continue after i let you know is darned hilarious
  yes yes i am because unlike you im not a fucking luddite who thinks in one direction all that extra information cant be used by the human eye but it can certainly be used towards for example making incredibly realistic photogrammetric point clouds to create 3d assets and texture wrappers with stop living in the past
  i must be really privileged if one of the most learned people in the world for audio and digital signals is talking with me on 4chan and hilarious since said person seems to not know very basics about audio    eitherway im done replying to your troll comments
  sameeeee
  this post is the audio equivalent of muh microcontrast leicacolours and 3d rendering
  how do you not understand its not about how much our eyes can see its about having that extra data making the image more capable of postprocessing  i understand that however i also know that we made a transition from 12bit to 14bit a decade or so ago and it was nigh impossible to tell the difference unless you used an extremely contrived example edited the everloving shit out of it and zoomed in to 100          im not saying its not good to advance the technology or that sony shouldnt make a sensor with 16 bit capture im just saying that this isnt really a big deal certainly not a canikon on suicide watch advancement
they need to fix video issue
but muh cheap lenses
  can it even be printed
  muh microcontrast leicacolours and 3d rendering  salty µ4/3 user detected you cant discuss what you dont know
  damn sony really is killing it right now they went allin on the sensor business and the results are more than impressing truly the leading innovators in the camera market today
  no because im discussing measurable objective indicators of quality youre referring to nonsense speak buzzwords    yoy just have a failing of knowledge exposing yourself as such was brave      what video issue sony already has the best video performance of any ilc and now theyve patented a global electronic shutter they will be the first to have zero rolling shutter

  ththats nice    are you from vitagen too  or do you know me from somewhere else randomly
  hi op here sony have now confirmed these sensors and added product numbers for them    thanks for highlighting what a whiney bitch boi faggot you are though 
  thanks for highlighting how much of a /g/tard you are by making this thread
  everyone uses gear senpai    the only reason not to be excited by new better tools is if you have no way of affording them     sorry
  everyone uses gear senpai  yet /ic/ doesnt post about new drawing tablets or new paint brushes all the time  besides i wasnt calling you a gearfag im calling you a /g/tard
  are paintbrushes a rapidly changing and improving technology
  the only reason not to be excited by new better tools is if you have no way of affording them  1 this isnt announcing any new photographic tools this is announcing s new sensor which might go into cameras or might just be destined for scientific/industrial imaging markets   2 he was criticizing the op for holding up this very minor advance in technology as if it were a game changer like people in this thread are talking about it like its the difference between a cellphone and a dslr when its going to be more like the difference between a rebel and another slightly newer rebel its not that the advance is bad its just not a big deal by any stretch of the imagination
  might go into cameras    the actual sensor is irrelevant the important factor is that bandwidth and throughput have had a huge boost 8k30fps12bit is insane compared to what can currently be done and the jump to 16 bit allows two more stops of dynanic range and should quickly lead to 2 stops better low light performance which again is huge    sure most shots you may not see much of a difference but this is about improving performance at the extremes youll also see that they have managed to make merged hdr shots in one raw which is fucking awesome and could see the end of hdr halos and an extra 6 stops of dynamic range in a single raw    im sure you dont see much of an improvement if your a casual photographer thats cool but why are you trying to downplay the significance of this to those that know what they are talking about it screams insecurity and shallow pockets
  nice but like always it wont turn a snapshitter into a pro
  this thread isnt aimed at snapshotters you self important cunt
  can you honestly think of a real world situation where this will make any visible difference at all  kek yes video
  do you ever get tired of huffing your own farts
  agree with this post the amount of brand loyalty is just pathetic i personally shoot panasonic because i like their video options but if i was looking for a full frame camera the a7iii would be at the top of my list     some people will buy a turd with canon stamped on it theyve really managed to engender strong brand loyalty and theyve clearly been coasting on that for some time now   no one is too big to fail  i hope they eventually remember that
  have you considered the possibility that there are things that make canon and nikon users prefer their brands besides blind brand loyalty that dont show up well on a spec sheet    im a canon guy but i recently bought an a7 ii and a d700 to fuck around with with the nikon im constantly thinking this camera is well designed but harder for me to use because im so used to canon     with the sony i just keep thinking wow this camera isnt very good     and keep in mind thats comparing a relatively ancient nikon to a sony that was still current until very recently
  stop proving /g/tard post photos
  low light performance isnt limited by bit depth its limited by the laws of physics all youll get is two extra bits of noise
  have you considered the possibility that there are things that make canon and nikon users prefer their brands besides blind brand loyalty that dont show up well on a spec sheet  not really because i use a variety of nikon gear for work  d850 d810 d4s d5 all their pro glass i have no issue working with that equipment  it definitely does what its supposed to but when im looking to shell out my own money for gear im not at all attracted to anything canikon are putting out and the fact is that tech wise theyre lagging behind sony significantly  hell theyre even lagging behind fuji now in some ways i honestly never thought id see the day that fuji would make a better video camera than canon but here we are with the xt3
  tech wise theyre lagging behind sony significantly   1 tech wise is key here on a spec sheet sony definitely wins in actual usage the differences are too small to actually be noticeable if i posted a picture from my 5d3 and a picture from an a7iii you wouldnt be able to tell which was witch unless both of the shots were of test charts and even then itd be iffy hell at equal resolutions and under iso 3200 you probably wouldnt be able to spot an a7iii vs a 5d classic the differences just arent that big   2 in actual usability canon and nikon and even panasonic and fuji are way ahead of sony you say youve used nikon and panasonic a lot but have you actually put in any significant sony time ive never heard anyone bitch about panasonic usability ive never heard anyone bitch about nikon usability you hear people complaining about how sony handles all the time from people who have used anything else before     like before i bought a sony myself i was here all the time arguing with antisony people that they were probably fine now that i own one ive found there are significant issues with them
    youre buying old equipment and applying the complaint to present generation some people will criticize you for this and they would be right to    ive never heard anyone bitch about panasonic usability  do you have experience with panasonic af  how many panasonic reviews have you read or seen this metric will be important to determine how much value is in your initial claim of not hearing anything negative  for example if you have seen 0 reviews then it makes sense that you have never heard a single complaint
  old equipment  certainly possible but given that the a7 ii that i own is the fourth iteration of the a7 line and that the problems i have with it are mostly the same problems i have with my a6000 id wager that they havent magically fixed all of the issues that have been hanging around sony cameras for the last several years maybe some but probably not all     panasonic reviews  i mean im clearly an enormous gearfag ive watched a bunch of reviews plus i read pretty much every dpreview review of every new camera that comes out regardless of whether or not i intend to buy one
  ive watched a bunch of reviews  then you should already know the most common issues on their usability
  a7 ii that i own is the fourth iteration  even this argument is a bit dishonest and grasping the straws quite a bit  a7 and a7r was released on the same day i think you are the first person to claim the a7r was the 2nd iteration of their camera    the only semi legitimate complaint you can make would be about the a7s not being built in the same say 7ii was  but even then someone could counter argue that people might prefer the generation 1 of 7s for its lightweight over generation 2 so its existence is still valid that way
  i have ff bodies from all 3 brands    bullshit prove it write dingleberry for your timestamp    wow this sony isnt very good    and you gave zero reasoning sounds realistic      you know there were people just like you at every sensor improvement announcement but every release sony manage to improve their products every single year you must be a canon user dont worry im sure theyll catch up to what sony were doing in 2012 eventually      you cant see the difference between canon and sony    kid are you blind or new colour science alone would give it away to anyone thats owned a camera for more than 3 months    in usability sony is the worst    you still havent touched on whats wrong with the sony and yes ive heard plenty of bitching about panasonic most of tge videographers i know have switched from panny to sony and couldnt be happier    i own a ff sony and canon    lol no you dont prove it timestamp with both cams and curmudgeonly written on the timestamp        i have an a6k along with my a7ii too but im a canon shooter     add that to the photo pal
  they have confirmed the sensors but not their specs you absolute fag
  ugh the a6000 is in a box thats difficult to get to right now this is going to be an annoying proof picture to take
great look at what you retarded fucks did
  5d mark iii 16 bit  no its 14 bit camera but that doesnt matter with canons because their read noise levels are so high that even 12 bits would be enough to encode the dynamic range now contemporary sony sensor on the other hand where the read noise floor is so low that its easy to produce a posterization or b rounding errors if the raw is processed in any manner    heres a flat field corrected d800 image or rather a bunch of them stitched together where the colour bands are caused by nikons white balance preconditioning its a simple multiplication of raw sensor data with a number close to one and subsequent rounding errors i know of this because ive used nikonhackers firmware on the camera that disables all such processing and the colour bands are never a problem    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwaregoogleimagespecific propertiesimage width662image height856
   no the 5d mark iii is a 14 bit camera  youre right of course typo on my part well not exactly typo i was throwing 12s and 14s and 16s around a lot and typed the wrong one sorry about that      prove you have a ff body from sony canon and nikon  with a timestamp  with dingleberry written on it  with curmudgeonly written on it  with an a6000 in frame as well  for my next trick maybe ill post pictures from all of them with the exif stripped and see if you can tell which one is which purely based on color science     you still havent touched on whats wrong with the sony   1 autofocus is a bitch to change your active focus point you have to redefine a button to be your choose a focus point button tap that button then tap another button for no reason ive been able to figure out yet then you can change your active focus point   2 menus are a confusing morass unlike canon and nikon theres no custom menu where you can stick frequentlychanged settings  3 you cant set a minimum shutter speed in aperturepriority autoiso if you want to have a minimum shutter speed you have to switch to m mode at which point it cant go over that speed if the light gets brighter  4 only two custom modes on the mode dial compared to 3 on my canon i use custom modes a lot and i usually use all three i havent used the sony in sufficientlychallenging scenarios to actually use them yet really but i played around with it a little bit and found it confusing  5 the control wheels are deliberately placed to be difficult to use because the firstgen a7 got a lot of complaints about the control wheels being changed accidentally  6 the evf/lcd eye sensor is too sensitive meaning that if i try to shoot at waist level most of the time it sees my big fat gut and thinks thats my face against the viewfinder even when its several inches away i think ive fixed this problem with a bit of carefullyplaced tape though    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makefujifilmcamera modelxt1camera softwareadobe photoshop lightroom classic 80 macintoshmaximum lens aperturef/28sensing methodonechip color areafocal length 35mm equiv41 mmimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution240 dpivertical resolution240 dpiimage created20181127 175649exposure time1/50 secfnumberf/32exposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating6400lens aperturef/32brightness10 evexposure bias1 evmetering modeaveragelight sourceunknownflashno flashfocal length2700 mmcolor space informationsrgbrenderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardsharpnessnormalsubject distance rangeunknown
   you still havent touched on whats wrong with the sony   more of whats wrong with the sony  7 the 50/18s autofocus is so slow that it feels like im using oldgeneration contrast detect autofocus even though the a7 ii claims to have phasedetect using my canon 50/18 stm on the mc11 adapter actually focuses faster how do you mess up a nifty fifty so badly  8 the smallest lens sony offers puts it at almost exactly the same depth although granted shorter as my 5d mark iii with the canon shortyforty one of the advantages of mirrorless is that you can have a camera with a significantly smaller package but so far that doesnt apply to sony ff  9 have to use a special app to update the firmware this app doesnt work on the current version of macos so i had to use my work windows laptop canon just lets you stick the firmware on a card and it figures it out  10 with canon lenses theres a bump for the af/mf switch aligned with the mountalign point which is straight up when you put a lens on very easy to do by feel sony lenses have a smaller bump and align at a slight angle for no good reason  11 so many customizable buttons so few options for them there is literally nothing in the available options that i would want on my down button after assigning c1c4 there are lots of things that i would want like maybe swapping between evf and lcd or between lcd and autoevf to mitigate 6 above but those arent options  12 to zoom in on a picture in play mode you hit c3 and thenwait it takes like three seconds to zoom in on a picture most cameras do it instantly  13 the weird database it makes on cards which causes it to take a little extra time any time you put in a fresh card not formatted in the camera and which gets fucked up and confuses it if you copy pictures off of the card without updating or deleting the db file every other camera company manages to handle files on a fat without an extra db
    now granted a few of these have been fixed in the a7 iii but this is also stuff that has fucked me up in just like a weeks worth of using this camera theres probably a lot of other things i havent hit yet because i havent gotten sufficiently into it
great  nikon z8 and panasonic s2 will have it
  the smallest lens sony offers puts it at almost exactly the same depth although granted shorter as my 5d mark iii with the canon shortyforty one of the advantages of mirrorless is that you can have a camera with a significantly smaller package but so far that doesnt apply to sony ff    well no the camera is a significantly smaller package and sony is absolutely offering that what youre referring to is lens size and its dictated by the laws of physics sony has smaller bodies which is awesome but due to the constraints of bending light through glass elements lenses really cant be shrunk much     however sony has managed to start finding other workarounds the new 400mm f/28 is a full kilo lighter 22lbs than either nikon or canons offerings meaning on an a9 that package is over 2 kilos 44lbs lighter than a 400mm f/28 on either a d5 or 1dx the lens itself is more or less the same physical dimensions but if its 30 lighter and the bodies are significantly smaller and lighter then overall its still a much more portable and usable system for long days
  more bandwidth is always better  also noise doesnt exist        the only real advantage of high res audio is the reduction of quantization noise which really is negligible anyway if you use dithering  everything else the amount of thermal noise in your amps resistors included is going to make a bigger difference
  youre a complete mouth breathing retard hes absolutely right shill or not
  audio waves above our hearing limit is still used by our ears for phase information this gives improved imaging and staging    but human hearing only goes to 20k    is naive af    as i said i can blind a/b test this all day long and never get it wrong but probably only because my stereo would cost the same as a new small car if you bought it from a shop and ive been building loudspeakers for 15 years
  what youre referring to is lens size  no what im referring to is total size of a working camera the smallest lens for the fe mount is a 35mm and an a7  35mm is the same depth as a canon 5d plus shortyforty which means the size advantage is pretty negligible     i understand that youre not going to be able to easily make a pancake 50mm thats less than 50 millimeters from the focal plane but i was hoping you could get a small wide thats shortersomething like the 16mm crop pancake but full frame im not an optical engineer though so maybe theres a good reason why they cant eg light rays coming in at way too steep an angle to give you an image not vignetted to hell
  the smallest difference phase shift that humans can hear which occurs  1khz is of about 10us so 100khz  while its about 24us/41khz  1k3hz andrew brughera 2013  you cant keep your head steady 12mm  you dont need anything that can reproduce up to 100k then youd just be feeling noise anyway  you cant keep your head steady 42mm  you dont need anything that reproduces up to 41k then same as above  inb4 you cant see more than 20k  do not suppose that everyone youre talking to doesnt know what theyre talking about you might look like the self important idiot  i can blind a/b test this all day long and never get it wrong  yeah right  i mean i have no way of proving you cant as much as you have no way of proving you can and everything leads me to believe that you cant what are you gonna do about it  my stereo is very expensive  good for you i wish i had an expensive hifi system  have you checked that your room is perfectly symmetrical and that the distance between your head and both speakers is the same 12mm you wouldnt want your staging to go to waste whatever you mean by that    i hope that from the above you can see that a difference of less than 5mm which may be a 2mm difference here and a 3mm difference there is more relevant than the difference between 441k and 192k  not to say that it isnt there only its very much negligible in the real world
  bollocks about keeping your head still    dude moving your head 5mm isnt going to break the stereo image ears are pretty fucking intelligent bits of kit if you move your head 5mm when listening to a flute does it stop being positional no well why do you think a speaker would be any different    is your room symmetrical    no but i run a completely active system with 30 channels of parametric eq and full fir filtering on every driver and i use a proper calibration mic with rew to perfect each driver one by one and i have an expansive sound stage thanks to using point source drivers for 90 of the fr i think youre getting confused with lobing/comb filtering    negligible in the real world    sure so are 14 stops of dynamic range in photography but here we are    and i can hear the difference it often doesnt even need to be an a/b test sometimes my audio resets to 16/44 after installing drivers and ill usually notice as i will start to get a bit pissed off listening to music quick check of my settings boom back to nice sounds    i wish i had an expensive hifi system    get into diy parts express has plenty of kits zaphs audio has plenty of complete designs the littel class d boards from sure electronics are phenomenally good bom in hifi tends to be about 10 of a consumer products price spend 500 in parts get 5k worth of hifi
  the lens i have on my a7ii doesnt even reach past the hand grip dude
  why are you even doing this    no amount of arguing will make the engineers stop improving the sensors  this is like yelling at the waterfall and hope the water eventually flow backwards or freeze to ice
  which lens ive been wanting a pancake for my a7 ii
  moving your head 5mm isnt gonna make any real difference  i very much agree but if you move your head 5mm youre losing all the additional phase info from your 192k and even 96k audio  so if that difference is negligible to you as much as it would to p much anyone i assume you too agree that the added phase info from that kind of hires audio effectively makes no difference  my room isnt simmetrical  30ch of active eq  fir filters  point source drivers  digital here digital there  calibration here and there  i would assume you mean 30 bands of eq rather than 30ch whatever the use for that many may be  if youre fixing very much noticeable stuff than youre introducing phase shift at different frequencies by much more than 10us  are all your speakers coax with the biggest woofer being about 3cm in diameter  i cant imagine what else youd mean by pointsource drivers in a hifi situation  most decent speakers also are fairly pointsource looking for more than 90 of the fr  lobing/comb filtering  if you dont have a symmetrical enough room then the reflections from the two speakers will blur the stereo image much more than the added phase info from a 192khz file is gonna make it clearer  you might be the one getting confused  14 stops of dr are negligible in the real world  they may be useless but theyre not negligible in the slightest i remember taking pictures of motorcyclists for a job a rally on a mountain and they had a fairly blue and clear sky in the background  thats just the first situation that comes to mind surely you can think of many more yourself  i can hear the difference  my audio resets to 16/44 after installing drivers  ill usually notice as i will start to get a bit pissed off  youre hearing the poor downsampling of your converters/drivers/audio player most likely  get into diy  ah thanks ill look into those
  id like newer better quality lower noise higher dr faster sensors  i was expressing my informed doubts about high resolution audio specifically
  its one i make myself using parts from old olympus xa cameras
  seriously pretty cool if true plus bolsters my point that sony can and should make a smaller lens for the fe mount     if trolling i guess you got me
  i have a7r3 its fantastic for photos but although 4k video is sharp and crisp it has horrible rolling shutter at 1080p rolling shutter is much lower but the video looks like upscaled 720p
  oh no all my fast panning shots are ruined theyre so popular in amateur videography    said no one ever
  the 20mm barely vignettes on full frame
  also applies to things other than the camera moving fampai
    who exactly are you comparing to    eos r has even worse rolling shutter despite the crop factor  nikon use the same sensor technology  could it be possible you are holding sony to a higher standard than any other camera maker
    the reason why you guys are meme this so hard is because the reviewers were unfair to sony the less flaws they find the harder they attack the few flaws they do find    on the opposite side the canon got so much shit for the singlecardslot issue so the reviewers barely even spend 2 seconds to point out rolling shutter was bad so there you have the opposite case the eos r was standing to the neck with shit so they were more lenient on the individual issues this is despite the canon having the worst rolling shutter in the various modes    you have been manipulated  i blame this on the reviewers though    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwarepaintnet 405imagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution95 dpivertical resolution95 dpi

  how could i forget all the helicopters and prop planes in my budget film    silly me      hey not having a dedicated button to switch between evf and rear lcd because sometimes the proximity sensor gets activated when its not wanted is a serious problem
  the sensor will be capable of it the cameras really really wont the number crunching required for it will take a far more powerful processor than the low power shit which is currently used in dslrs a theoretical camera capable of doing it would chug electricity and produce fuckloads of heat   in something with the form factor of a fs7 or perhaps even a ursa mini pro you could do it but our low power chips are a while off being able to do that kind of processing
  who fucking cares mirrorless shutterless global sensor is the future all these current gen cameras are just milking your wallet for as much as possible before releasing the next hot potato tech they have been sitting on for years they never release something very ground breaking until they have something that is better than it already that way competition can always been somewhat matched or exceeded by only a small margin without triggering another company to put out something too groundbreaking the far far exceed where their current rd is at
  a serious problem  you joke but its a legit issue     the eye detect sensor is so over sensitive that by default it will turn off the lcd if youre shooting at waist level in a lot of lighting situations i even had it trigger and turn off my lcd with just light shadows falling on it not always but often     so say you want to take a low angle shot heres the procedure with the sony  1 try to get the low angle shot when you move the camera away from your face the lcd should turn on if the lighting is right for this to work great get the shot and its one step even easier than a dslr but if the light isnt quite right and the eye sensor doesnt work  2 lcd shuts off adjust the camera position to try to get the lcd to come on again i often find that it will turn off when my framing is right and turn back on if i move it out of position which makes me want to throw it at a wall   3 give up on that because its getting really frustrating hit the menu button  4 search for the appropriate setting which is deep in the middle of the menus and you can never remember if its a camera setting or a gear setting sony doesnt offer a customizable menu like canon and nikon and they wont let you assign this feature to one of the bajillion custom buttons   5 find the setting switch it to lcd   6 get the shot  7 switch it back because having that on means it will never go back to evf until you do     on a dslr its just  1 hit the hardware live view button  2 get the shot  3 hit the live view button again or just wait since eventually itll go back to ovf mode on its own     its not a dealbreaker but its super frustrating and gets in the way of photography which is exactly the opposite of what a good camera should do     note i have fixed this on my personal a7ii with a bit of tape but i shouldnt have had to
  500 words on how your evf proximity sensor is a bit too sensitive whilst canon use a 17 video crop    you wonder why no one takes anti sony niggers seriously
  implying canon having shitty video modes means sony mustnt be criticized  like if someone were asking for a camera for 4k video i wouldnt recommend the eos rf that doesnt excuse sony from fucking up the controls for basic still photography on its camera focused on basic still photography as badly as it did
  cant make a custom function for one rarely used feature  fucking up the controls    whilst fuji out here with fixed dials canon having half as many buttons as it needs and nikon having far too many dedicated buttons that do pointless shit    youre being a whiney faggot anon and youve been whining about this same faggotry for months what have you done to fix it have you emailed sony and asked them to consider it in their next fw update of course not you thrive off being a whiney faggot
  im speaking from experience having used a crapload of different cameras youre arguing from pure brandfaggotry     im sorry i said mean things about the team you chose to align yourself that was very mean of me i know youll never accept that sony might have issues with their ergonomics so mentioning actual issues ive actually encountered while attempting to do actual photography with the actual sony cameras that i actually own was rude and uncalled for i must just be an irrational antisony partisan even though i dropped about a grand on an a7ii kit with the intention of transitioning to mirrorless if it was good enough i apologize now you can go back to i assume never actually taking pictures with your camera
  the magical thing about a healthy competitive market is that everyone can buy the camera that works for them why you idiots expect everyone to unconditionally like sonys cameras i have no idea its ok for people not to like things
  not him but this particular dude has a pretty dishonest steak about him as said earlier  nearly all of the issues like the proximity sensor and custom menu has been addressed in mark 3 but he is still talking as if they are current issues    i recognize his style of posting from another thread that sperged about a7sii issues even though its made obsolete by the cheaper a7iii
  hes a complete moron every single sony thread hes there whining about literally the most trivial bullshit ever    an overly sensitive evf sensor    are you fucking kidding me
  who fucking cares  retarded reviewers are a serious issue everybody should care    they distorted reality so much that people think sony has the worst rolling shutter when that isnt the case at all
  addressed in mark 3   i can only speak from experience with the nexc3 a6000 and a7ii if theyve fixed all of those problems then great fucking took them long enough     i recognize his style of posting  pretty sure you dont since i dont think ive ever said anything about the a7sii       every single sony thread  i was mostly defending sony up until a couple of months ago when i got my a7ii so im pretty sure youre thinking of some other anon     an overly sensitive evf sensor are you fucking kidding me  dont think of it as an overly sensitive evf sensor think of it as multiple poor design decisions which lead to a slow and frustrating experience when trying to shoot from anything below eye level plus i had a whole laundry list of other quibbles with the camera that i mentioned above if you really disagree with this one so much
  how is it any different than nintendo vs genesis or the bit wars just another stupid fucking gimmick made by sony
  30 000 dollar phase one cameras arent gimmicks  40 000 dollar red cameras arent either    those are high end pro features
  how was the nes compared to the n64    exactly the same thing right technological progress literally had zero effect on gaming right      all of those problems  yeah how dare a first generation poorboy budget device not be perfect     fucking took them long enough    yeah 5 years for a brand new product line and new product category is far too long to iron out every tiny subjective problem i can find    youre thinking of some other anon     oh that other anon with a faulty prox sensor on his a7ii that never shuts up about it on a board with maybe 50 regulars tops    fuck me pal youre too dumb to use sony im glad you dont get along with them    think of it as multiple poor design decisions which lead to a slow and frustrating experience when trying to shoot from anything below eye level    i have no idea what the fuck you are talking about pic related camera pressed so its almost squeezing against my body if i bring it any closer so it swaps ill start to block off the screen with my own body same camera as yours    i can only deduce youre trying to invent problems that dont exist to justify you being a shit tog
  first generation  im sorry did you just refer to the sony a7ii as a first generation device    the a7ii    like ignoring the fact that its at firmware revision 400 when most of my issues couldve been fixed in firmware updates     and ignoring the fact that theres also the a7r line and a7s line that use basically the same body     and ignoring all of sonys other mirrorless cameras that came before the a7 line like their nex line and cameras like the a6000 which came out before the a7ii and have the same issues with menus and such     and ignoring the fact that the technology in the a7ii is built on a legacy of other sony/minolta digital cameras going back to the minolta 5d and 7d and including a fair few full frame bodies in the same class as the a7ii     ignoring all of that     youre calling the sony a7 mark fucking two a first generation camera    poorboy budget device  1700 launch price isnt insane but i wouldnt call it a poorboy budget device     that other anon with a faulty prox sensor  no im definitely the one whos been bitching about that all over the board but ive never bitched about the a7s line     no idea what the fuck youre talking about  yeah its maddeningly inconsistent i think it has something to do with the prevailing lighting conditions and the color of shirt im wearing i cant really test it anymore because i stuck some lightblocking tape over half of my sensor and it seems to have fixed the problem i found this trick because i googled it and lots of other people had the same problem and so had come up with workarounds so its not something limited to just me     i can only deduce  or i have a different shooting style than you and have legitimate issues with the camera based on that and based on my experience with other cameras that dont have those problems sounds to me like youre too blinded by your weird team loyalty to sony to accept any criticism
  kid are you blind or new colour science alone would give it away to anyone thats owned a camera for more than 3 months  heres a thread of pictures taken with my sony and canon full frame bodies each with their respective systems 50/18 processed normally in lightroom with the camera standard profiles ie not adobe standard for each see if you can tell which shot comes from which camera based on colors 
sony a7s iii sensor datasheet leaks showing 4k at 480fps      bye bye canon    
  implying canon was even in the video mirrorless game
  implying all video isnt mirror less anyway  implying canon wasnt the one who put video on dslrs first   just pushes canon back 10 years
  they are    right now they are the only ones who offer the autofocus  articulating screen to the youtube market
  lots use the a7iii now and they just know it will be in focus even though they have no flip out screen    or the gearfags have an atamos on top
  you can stream from sonys to a phone to use as a remote viewfinder much easier than trying to view a 3 screen from 5 feet away
  maybe we will get fullframe full sized video cameras
  4k at 480fps  this is for broadcasting equipment    it will be priced so far out of our price range it wont even be funny  probably 50k or 100k for a camera like that
  considering the very best slow mo camera right now does 1/4 the framerate at 4k and has a piddly m43 size sensor that sounds like a bargain regardless of price and hopefully the larger sensor reduces the need for a second sun to get a decent exposure
    this has been fixed in every single sony body released since the a7rii    stop being such a poor fag and upgrade your camera idiot     or stop being such a retard and program one of your 75 custom buttons to toggle evf override since youre not smart enough to find it in the menus
  or stop being such a retard and program one of your 75 custom buttons to toggle evf override since youre not smart enough to find it in the menus  that was my first thought too on encountering the issue however the a7ii doesnt offer the option of setting evf override as a custom button option which is especially frustrating since as you imply ive got a shitton of extra custom buttons i literally have more custom buttons than i have useful features i can assign to them while at the same time having features i want to assign to custom buttons which i cant
  if you want 480fps youre always going to need a second sun
  jokes on you ive got 3 suns
  well i wouldnt touch film with a stick but i bought my first dslr a 40d a long time ago it was just released at that point i ditched it a few years back and have a newer camera a 50d i use the 50d as a production camera and the images i take with it sell very well still i have made lots of money with these two my only two dslrs  you do not have to play that game modern digital dslrs are all good
  you can paint a house using a dead cat instead of a brush    thanks for that insight cunt
  more like you can paint a house using an old roller or a shiny new magnesiumhandle roller with laser sight and youll get pretty much the same results
  1/480 is 2 stops faster than 1/120 full frame is 2 stops larger sensor    1/480 on sony should be similar in quality to 1/120 on m43    fuckin based sony
  film  still gives better tones and highlight detail  oh ha ha ha ha ha
  16bit is a meme    8k and 4k specs sound big if true    if the adc yields 2ev more dr then it will really put pressure on others canon why the fuck havent you taken advantage of your dpaf arrangement to gain 12ev    dolhdr sounds awesome    protip sony will fuck it up some how shit weather sealing even worse color science or some rare but significant iq issue like striping or off sensor flare
  sony colour science reeeeeee    in 2 seperate unbiased tests sony has shown itself to have the most preferred colour science    striping    no thats nikons new cameras
  film is still the industry standard for archiving museums pieces   really makes you think
  in 2 seperate unbiased tests sony has shown itself to have the most preferred colour science  oh fuck off with muh tests they were not double blind tests and you cannot judge the color science of a camera or film by a single image in one lighting situation you have to shoot hundreds of images maybe thousands to really get to know it      no thats nikons new cameras  thats the a7 iii
  citation needed
  oh fuck off with muh tests  canon nikon fujifilm fans literally near unanimously voted in the sony colours as the most likable and the least disliked    the trick was that it wasnt tagged as sony but was bait tagged with a different brand    thats the a7 iii  the other anon is right nikons have the worse case of stripes than the a7iii
  sony fixed its striping issue in a fw update this is easy for sony they make the sensor they know how to fix issues     nikon has not and does not    it wasnt double blind    yes yes they were  sony did lose if any image was labelled as a sony image but it always won if not labelled or labelled incorrectly    the tests proved without doubt that sony had the most liked colour science and that there was significant bias against sony    enough cucknon and nicuckon and fujicuck tears to wash my oversized lenses
leave nikon alone sonybros we are allies    go team sonikon
  there there everything will be daijoubu
   fuck off with muh tests  canon nikon fujifilm fans literally near unanimously voted in the sony colours as the most likable and the least disliked  you cannot judge a sensor or film by one set of photos under one set of lighting conditions cite your special poll all you want it doesnt mean shit    the trick was that it wasnt tagged as sony but was bait tagged with a different brand  so it wasnt even double blind but introduced intentional bias citing it shows how little you know and nothing else    s the a7 iii  the other anon is right nikons have the worse case of stripes than the a7iii  the other anon pretended sony didnt have an issue at all      sony fixed its striping issue in a fw update   you can fix lost information with a fw update  its a hardware problem its admittedly a rare problem but this is now the 3rd generation and sony still cant get their sensor covers right to prevent off sensor flare of one form or another     wasnt double blind  yes yes they were  neither you nor the other anon have even cited a poll and whatever one the other anon is referring to was not double blind    and again for the brainlets in the forum you cannot judge a sensor or film by one set of photos under one set of lighting conditions a proper poll on this issue would require users to pick among probably 100 or more image groups under the same number of variable lighting and subject scenarios    the tests proved without doubt  you have no clue what youre talking about
  yeah my giant corporation can beat the shit out of your less giant corporation
  buzz off pooji nobody likes you
  you cannot judge a sensor or film by one set of photos under one set of lighting conditions  you can especially if that set of lighting was the super standard way most studios are set up    so it wasnt even double blind but introduced intentional bias   the only bias this proves is bias against sony not for  but he actually seperated this bias test into a different set  the first set of questions was blind test where they didnt know the brands
   cannot judge a sensor or film by one set of photos under one set of lighting conditions  you can especially if that set of lighting was the super standard way most studios are set up  do you even own a camera    protip given the same wb setting and neutral style settings sensors are 99 identical in their color rendition of a standard studio scene with a macbeth chart thats not what differentiates one companies color science from another     it wasnt even double blind but introduced intentional bias   the only bias this proves is bias against sony not for  t doesnt understand science  to answer the question of which ooc color science the average person preferswhich btw is not the question of which is preferred by pros who edit their photosthe test must be double blind and the results only speak to the exact subject/lighting combination tested    also anons keep referring to these special tests but with no links if its the northrup test its nonscientific and means nothing
  sensors are 99 identical in their color rendition  we have been over this before    no they arent not even close    the average person prefers  the average photographer their audience is a very specific audience not just anybody
  jpeg  different lenses  different exposures  different wb
  its december now wheres that magic sensor of yours also what ever happened to that a7000 supposed pro apsc sony
  it doesnt matter how hard you strawgrasp you are simply not correct
  if its impossible to tell the difference how come i got 70 correct in that other thread and they were just randomly taken photos no direct comparisons available    and no tony and spi both used a variety of photos taken under a variety of conditions    it wasnt even double blind    watch tonys video youre embarassing yourself    its a hardware problem    oh so thats why hardly anyone has mentioned it since april    brainlets  hi jamie i see youre salty that fuji got wrecked by sony stay sad    the tests are wrong wahhhhhh    oh little pudding its ok to be sad but just because you lost it doesnt invalidate the test      different brands produce similar macbeth charts    lmfao no they dont hence why i always advise using a colour chart to profile every lens and body combo you use    tonys test is non scientific    oh please do explain what he did that didnt follow scientific method      imagine being a photographer and so visually illiterate you cant see the difference between brands    we used to have idiots like you in the film era too that believed with all their hearts that all colour negative stock had the same colour profile morons never change       theyre coming   no other brand comes anywhere near sony for turnaround time for implementing new technology into a product your comment just highlights how desperate you are to shit talk sony 
  sony is chocking hard at the moment  apsc has solidly landed in fujifilms grasp sony doesnt stand a chance there anymore    they are delivery high quality stuff but it feels like half their pr0jects have been scraped and canceled  they had a 135mm in the runour mill but only managed to release 2 lenses for their ff system    granted they are exceptional lenses but is it a failure to deliver and will only help canon/nikon with catching up
  no other brand comes anywhere near sony for turnaround time for implementing new technology into a product  sorry but sony is in a different phase right now    i call is the arrogant phase where they feel they are invincible and can afford to drop plans cancel projects and push the schedule further behind    their normal capability is 67 lenses a year and good quality lenses at that  i feel they are going into a new direction where they will only release the lens if it is exceptional and peerless  like the 400 f28 with the unique weight distribution  and the 24 f14 with peerless astigmatism control    the rest of the lenses cancelled or reworked because they arent good enough for sony  this could come back to bite sony from behind
  fuji wn  lmao pal no look at amazons best sellers sony have 7 skus for apsc mirrorless cameras before fujis first appearance        it feels like    name one sony product that hit the roadmap but not the shelves    2 lenses    since when sony have released 6 this year so far      they only want to release peerless lenses    i guess thats why next up theyve got a cheap 35 18 coming out to go with their new budget ff body lmfao youre a clown
  since when sony have released 6 this year so far  2015  6 ff lenses  2016  7 ff lenses  2017  6 ff lenses  2018  2 ff lenses    it doesnt look good in terms of lenses  the 35 f18 screams of me too i can do what nikon just did wait for me
  sony have 7 skus for apsc mirrorless cameras before fujis first appearance  the future wont be so certain sony is living off of word of mouth an high praises that have survived to this day from 2014    my guess is 6300 and 6500 wont achieve the same sales as a6000 even if they were priced 500 dollars  they didnt have the same big splash launch world wide they will be forgotten cameras
  i downloaded the files and they literally have different wb settings you tard not to mention obviously different exposures and manufacturers evolve their style settings over time and tweak them for different marketing segments dpreview doesnt equalize this    same studio lighting exposure lens wb and color profile and a macbeth chart will look damn near identical across sensors easy studio lighting is not where differences stand out    if you process your shots then for most work ooc color wont matter especially if you use hand tuned color profiles but under certain conditions it absolutely does    and no tony and spi both used a variety of photos taken under a variety of conditions  two photos  similar lighting  variety    oh so thats why hardly anyone has mentioned it since april  it was acknowledged as being flare off of sensor af points the firmware fix interpolates the missing data from neighboring pixels its a hardware issue glossed over by a software fix    hi jamie  no      different brands produce similar macbeth charts  lmfao no they dont hence why i always advise using a colour chart to profile every lens and body combo you use  yet you post dpreview samples that do not equalize exposure much less wb and lens    oh please do explain what he did that didnt follow scientific method  learn what double blind means    imagine being a photographer and so visually illiterate you cant see the difference between brands  imagine being a human so intellectually challenged you cant fathom what factors influence your tests    we used to have idiots like you in the film era too   i think more important than any conclusion on color science is the conclusion that you are literally an asshole      theyre coming  any day now      marketshare determines the bestest cameras  then canon wins hands down and sony can go home
  then canon wins  on the rabals and dx format wins    sony has won the full frame market
  canon wins    lol no according to cipa sony is leading the way on ff sales and looking at mirrorless sales on amazon canon have 3 skus in the top 20 bestsellers sony have 14    youre an asshole  no im just right and your pride is having issues with dealing with being proven wrong in public     learn what double blind means  like not knowing what camera took what shot and the order of the images not being controlled by the website     lets turn this on its head how is that not a double blind test idiot     macbeths come out the same    no and again sony are objectively the best        its a hardware issue glossed over byva software fix    no that implies the fix could be seen if the fix fixes the issue and cant be seen its not a glossover its a fix    same lighting exposure lens wb and color profile    lmfao let me just apply my canon colour profile to my sony camera thats gonna stop them looking different   lmfao no thanks for clearing up how little you know though         the 35 screams of me too     no the 35 screams of we listen to our customers with the very expensive 35 gm and niche and expensive 35 28 sony users have been wanting a normal 35 for a while this fits right along side their 28 f2 85 18 and 50 18 which are their best selling lenses and now the focus of their efforts obviously pro lenses came first as they are the online influencers so they need to be kept happy       specialist products dont sell aswell as the cheap consumer option    thanks for that economic insight pal but rabals massively outsell the 5d range but everyone has fond memories of the 5d cameras and no one cares for rabals the same could be said of the d3x00 and d800    regardless sony are the top selling mirrorless cameras and top selling ff cameras on a mount thats 5 years old thats pretty embarassing for everyone elese
  no the 35 screams of we listen to our customers  okay but why only 2 lenses in the entirety of 2018  its not like the optics engineers was transferred over to the a7000 camera    why the sudden drop in released lenses  the only explanation is cancelled/pushed back projects
why is the dynamic range on modern dslrs still so bad when a new one comes out it gets shilled based on number of megapickles fps and the various gimmicks like gps etc but rarely on what really counts  the ability to capture lowlights and highlights approximating to what the eye sees i have a canon 6d is it worth upgrading to a 5d iv or would i just be throwing money away for virtually undetectable improvements in picture quality
  dont upgrade you can always merge over and underexposed images
havent shot either one but on paper it looks like a decent step up
  doesnt magic lantern have some trick to improve dynamic range  you should try that if you havent already      not sure if it works with 6d but probably does
  for landscapes and stuff yeah but i sometimes shoot weddings and events so it would be much better if i could capture a greater range in camera
  the 5d4 is not a worthwhile upgrade if you want better image quality     the 5d4 is a great upgrade for the better controls and build quality
how do i make a photo with 14 stops of dynamic range  yet people used to and still do make 5 stop dynamic range on slide film work if you cant deal with 14 stops you might need to just get good
our eyes have pretty shit dr its why slide film and ccd looks so appealing
  moron of the day
  dual iso double exposure thing
  yet people used to and still do make 5 stop dynamic range on slide film work  the slide was the final product that is what you gave the client the agency etc people who routinely shot slide film learned to analyse a scene before shooting it and work with what was in front of them    these days people dont learn to work with the scene in front of them instead they spend their time bickering on forums about my camera has half a stop more dr than yours as if that makes a significant difference theyve been lulled into a never ending spend  sell  upgrade cycle everytime some new game changer is announced    they freely admit that the new game changer wont improve their photography but deep down inside it makes them feel better for being poor photogrpaphers who are too lazy to learn to work with what is in front of them
  shoot sony it nikon full frame of you want actuall good dr or 1314 stops canon sensors are outdated af    on a normal monitor you wont see all those stops but you can squish them more together having the high mid and low end of the spectrum visible      but our eyes adapt and our brain compiles so fast that we actually see much higher dr in daylight than current cameras
  get the 5dsr mirrorless replacement body when it comes out
  our eyes are like 20 stops try taking a picture of stars you see with your eyes in the sky on a lit street
  shoot sony it nikon full frame of you want actuall good dr or 1314 stops
  these days people dont learn to work with the scene in front of them  this is the number one problem with beginning/amateur photographers today im an old fart 64 and film/processing was fucking expensive we learned to visualize the finished product before we pressed the shutter button and learned in the case of portraiture to time the expression/action to capture what bresson called the decisive moment now with digital so many people just go for the shotgun method blast away and hope something works
the dumb thing is these fucktards bleat incessantly about muh dynamic range as if an nth of a stop makes some significant difference but they dont have a clue how to utilise their supposed advantage in the first place they just abuse it in post
  i totally agree im glad i switched to 8x10 film for some years and back to digital now my exposures are much better just because i know the zone system
  show us your kodachromes old one
  this is something an average gearfag wont ever be able to comprehend let alone utilize
  digital dr is bad meme  its clear you never actually shot film every dslr on the market today can match or beat kodak portra for dr inb4 grey sky sample film fags claim is 9001 stops most other color films were a good 23 stops behind portra    soup up the right bw film and you can out dr a nikon d850 but a typical bw film in a typical developer would yield 910ev e6 films were 68ev    thumb through an old photography magazine sometime blocked up shadows were the norm highlights rolled off a little better but they still rolled off and blew out when i got my first dslr in 2003 i was impressed with the dr versus the films i was shooting at the time and that dslr was maybe a 10ev sensor 11ev with nr in the shadows    the 5d4 is about 15 stops better than a 6d in terms of dr if you shoot dual pixel raws theres a tool that will give you another stop on the highlight side putting it on par with a d850    howeveryou have to know how to exploit that how to expose for it process it and get it on a print or screen something tells me youre not accomplishing that with a 6d so a 5d4 wont benefit you
    shoot sony it nikon full frame of you want actuall good dr or 1314 stops canon sensors are outdated af  the 5d4 has 136 stops of dr in dual pixel raw mode you can get 146
  taking a local college course in bw film development and reading ansel adams works for the class was one of the best things i ever did for my digital exposures
i just cant wait till sony announce budget fullframe insiders said it would cost 1500 bucks they had 995 market share and after nikon z and canon eosr came out thet have only 65 so they will drop prices and make budget a7m3 when i cant wait if it would be in a6500 body i will buy it tommorow just put a7m3 sensor in a6500 i dont need nothing more
  just keep waiting poorfag
  that looks painful to use
i could be so best camera i want it
  it is the sony apsc cameras are abominations
  the grip isnt bad unless you have really big hands the viewfinder in the corner is also more convenient than in the middle on a7 line      sony seems to have abandoned their apsc line like one new camera and no new lenses in four years so i wouldnt be surprised if the rumored a6500 successor turns out to be ff
  basically a brick with slappedon grip
  so the a6 line is only comfortable to use for toddlers women and manlets gotcha
lol grip like if anybody really care except for 1 pros
i really wish they would do one of these that has two programmable dials instead of the idiot dial like the old nex7
  assblasted cannon fanboy peter mckinnon subscriber reeeeee
  just buy a battery grip and youre good
hey i really wish companies would sell me more stuff for less money why dont they do this theyre missing out on so many sales
  the people who actually takes pictures instead of jerks of to the cameras they own
attach a full size lplate to the camera and the grip is fine    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce7rm2camera softwareadobe photoshop camera raw 96 macintoshmaximum lens aperturef/28focal length 35mm equiv90 mmimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20160706 075336exposure time1/200 secfnumberf/28exposure programnormal programiso speed rating500lens aperturef/28brightness44 evexposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length9000 mmcolor space informationuncalibratedrenderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal

i am unsure if this is the right thread but ill just post it    any professional photographers here  i just have a quick question for professional photographers regarding rates and services    location vancouver canada   current minimum wage here is 1265 cad    if i were to hire one of you guys to photoshop enhance my projects which is mainly interior design photos and perhaps some exteriors for homes how much would you charge me    also how much would you charge if you were to take the photos of these interiorsexteriors    pic posted are the rough standards but not my project thanks anons
this one is a project i worked on as a designer but i was not involved with photography and rendering    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2015 macintoshimagespecific propertiesimage width5000image height3333number of bits per component8 8 8compression schemeunknownpixel compositionrgbimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage data arrangementchunky formatimage created20171115 111505color space informationuncalibratedimage width940image height569
why dont you contact some photogrophers/retouchers and ask for rates instead like any sensible person would
in terms of actual photographers i do not know many renderers though are a different story plus outsourcing might be nice even selftaught people with enough talent will suffice too
    locally i charge 400 flat to go to a property in 15mi radius from me and shoot and retouch up to 30 photos i have a checklist that they fill out    this covers a 23 bedroom pretty well  not all photos get used in the listings usually    extra photos 20/ea  extra mileage 1/mi    i spend about 6090mins onsite and usually 4hrs editing    revisits are 100 bucks and 20/photo  i shoot inside right around sunset  i like to shoot outside at blue hour    i also request that the owners or whoever are there to let me in but then just let me take my time and do my work  hope this helps    i dont do this full time but 45 a month is pretty easy
  that sounds neat actually and your reply does help how about sketchup renders do any of those

  i really want to get into interiors but i have no idea where to start could i just email an interior designer or a real estate company to take their photos
i mean you can for practice but for commercial use you can probably ask for permission hell theyll probably use you to render their stuff     interior designer
  photoshopping onto a render like this would look not look great and actually probably take more time than a basic 3d render
  fair enough as an interior designer my weakest point is in rendering honestly would take eons just to finish one render
my sketchup render a little cringey but hey effort/10 lol
  damn bro where do you live    i shoot homes in colorado for 75100 30 images
would 1020mm on apsc would be ok for interior shootings
  someone pls halp    im looking to get started with interior photography but i dont know where to begin not in terms of gear but building a portfolio should i be emailing interior designers/decorators and real estate companies for tfp shoots if so is this appropriate    hi ____  im a freelance photographer looking to build a portfolio for interior and architectural photography id be happy to take photos of your work to add to my work set and you may use the images for whatever purpose youd like    heres my current portfolio ______    thanks  ______
  were not doing your homework m8
  homework  it isnt my homework anon why are you so irrelevant
  yes pretty much that is fine however if you do not have any works to show them such as interior or exterior photos and renders then i will advise you to give them at least a few shots for free as a demo on what they can expect from you    as an interior designer i do like free photos but before i pay for anything i want to see what im paying for
  starting off you need skills to show off  second you need clients so best way is to offer a few free photographs to show off and hopefully they contact you for future projects or perhaps connect you to other designers and such
  if you dont want to give it out for free put a watermark on it however starting out giving out a tiny bit of extra service will make them grateful and in turn make you look like a good business partner
      thank you anons
      any other ways to word the id be happy to line
  search for cold contact cover letters
  charge more or git gud whichever is your blunder
  location vancouver canada   if i were to hire one of you guys to photoshop enhance my projects  100 an hour with 2 hour minimum   i am in alberta  i dont shoot interiors or real estate anymore too many people racing to the bottom shooting cheaper and cheaper it was hard when people started shooting 100120 per location doesnt pay for wear and tare on gear let alone time its impossible now that there are guys shooting for 50 per location       locally i charge 400 flat  and retouch up to 30 photos  this is probably the minimum someone needs to charge to make it worth their time
  contact the realtors they typically contract their own photographers realtors however are the cheapest scumbags on earth dont expect to get rich     yep thats average and its not worth doing at that price     yeah     realtors probably dont give a shit about your portfolio they want the cheapest they can get

these are all just random snapshits whats the story
these are interesting thanks anon
  best shot of the set
is the sony qx1 worth it for photography
how the fuck are clip on cameras even real just get a wifi enabled camera and transfer to your phone nigga haha
  im about to google how much this costs and sample images brb if it doesnt make me go commit die
  im back   700 on ebay  fuck off
  because why carry both a cellphone and a camera when you can just carry a cellphone plus a fiddly camerasized attachment to the cellphone that isnt nearly as easy to use and doesnt really provide any obvious benefit over just using one of sonys many small cameras that has wifi as a feature    and youll save so much mo    oh
  i found one for much cheaper on another site
  i actually like the idea i just dont think everything is quite right there jet and i doubt it ever will be with manufacturers treating it as a cheap way to make some more money  its basically modular photography like in build your own pc in perfect situation youd be able to change sensor without needing to change the body you could even go with sensor from different manufacturer add and change viewfinders take care of your own battery supply have custom built bodies etc its just that i think manufacturers are afraid of loosing body sales and are rather happy with closed systems
  yeah how much cheaper we talking if it cost more than a pocketable point and shoot youre getting your daily dose of meme with that thing
  think of it as your internet connection might want to check if its plug n play if it connects easily via wifi no lag and no intermittent discon
    i have one     it is an okay backup if you are already invested in emount it is nice and tiny and sits easily at the bottom of a bag start up is relatively quick and painless especially if you are on android and use nfc and it takes good pictures if i remember right it has an nex6 sensor or something similar from that era    once you get it synced it works flawlessly the sync app was mediocre when it released but it is pretty awesome now no lag no disconnects no other issues you have full manual controls through a touchscreen which is admittedly quite awkward and the option to transmit to your phone as you take pictures instead of just saving to the microsd jpegs only wont transfer raws or it wouldnt last time i used it months ago it even has focus peaking for manual focus lenses    once linked up it works as smoothly and flawlessly as your phones normal camera    take a look at the yodobashi review for it they have the best one i have seen                it was 400 new    i wouldnt pay more than 200300 for it with the lens included it was an awesome buy when it was released but now the sensor is getting a little on the old side
20 megapickles the problem i had is there is no manual mode just exposure compensation its nice for mounting a telephoto on a tripod and using it remotely but its not a good walk around street photo camera its nice for shooting video on a tripod though but not for any kind of action or sports  i use it on a copy stand to photograph flat stuff
      thanks for the feedback anons

buys camera attachment for phone that costs as much as a legit camera
  kek   hang on i cant take your photo my mom keeps calling me asking where i went with her minivan
cant see one anywhere at all at all    talk about photography gear  ask questions about photography gear  answer questions about photography gear    read the sticky   read the rules 
why does nikon put a better flippy screen on the d5xxx models then on there top level body
  because entry level consumers use their first dslr like a ps
  why does nikon put a better flippy screen on the d5xxx models then on there top level body  the understanding whether its true or not is that pros see things like that as fragile and harder to weather seal so they dont want it on the higherend bodies canon does the same thing with flippy screens up to the 6d level but not the 5d or 1d line
  cant see one anywhere at all at all    lurk moar faggot 
  in his defense at first glance that looks like a thread about cleaning your camera rather than a general /gear/ thread

best lenses to use for convention photography
      does literally everything and is blessed by lord ken
  anything sharper than a kit lens and no less wider than f/28 i had the best shots made with a minolta 40mm f/2 and canon 100mm l/olympus macro 90mm f/2
im having some storage problems    thinking about a seagate 6 or 8tb dock hd worth it

    used a 35mm/18 and a 1855mm kit lens at a convention that i went to recently and i was looking to upgrade the kit lens at least so i might go out to grab the 18300 at this point and replace my 70300 as well    the 35mm was great for any photos on the main show floor but anything wider would require the kit lens which isnt too great overall
  a crock of shite excuse
  18300mm  do not the image quality and softness you get out of both of them is terrible for that amount of money get a 2470mm instead and keep the 70300  is your 70300 the vr fx version because that one is amazingly sharp and nice to have  but yeah get any 2470mm f/28 the 28 is going to help a lot indoors i think the 2485mm vr is also good for dx but only if you can find a dirt cheap deal for it  if you dont care and just want a lens that does everything go ahead and get it it does exactly what its supposed to
  but the 2470 is easily 23x the price of the 18300 not quite ready to spend that much money yet
  how much are you willing to spend
  sigma 1835 18 for width
im looking to upgrade to my first full frame camera and ive boiled my choices down to a pentax k1 sony a7iii or canon 5dmkiv with it im looking to invest in some studio lighting right now i namely shoot street landscapes and candids of friends im wanting to upgrade due to poor low light performance as well as bad dr on my camera what do you think the best option is i know the 5d4 is more expensive but i wouldnt be opposed to buying used to mitigate some of the cost im really stuck on this unfortunately and cant tell if theres really any genuine difference between the sony and pentax both of which im leaning towards for the price point
  tamron has a nice 2875mm 28 thats cheap but they also have a 2470mm 28 which has significantly better glasses but is 75 more expensive
my father fell for the black friday meme and got some new camera so he said i can have his old nikon d7000 if i like but just the body since he doesnt have any spare lense he doesnt need i have no idea of photography whats a good cheap general purpose lense to get started with that camera
  the d7000 is fantastic ive used it myself but i just own the d7100 now  the 1855mm vr kit lens goes for about 6080 used just dont expect fantastic image quality from it but it does the job well enough and serves as a really good learning platform  what camera did your dad get anyways
  i dont know i didnt ask him he just said it was off by 600  this seems to be a slow board anyway when he wakes up tomorrow morning ill call him and ask  the thread is probably still alive then    thanks for the suggestion is it this one  
  yup thats the one its not a bad lens sharper than almost all dx lenses and makes you figure out if you actually really like photography or not  there is of course also the 2485mm vr version which costs a lot more but is a tiny bit sharper but nothing to write home about    man using 4chan without 4chanx fucking sucks
  swiss second hand market is really tiny and prices are often unrealistic in almost everything not specifically cameras for example i noticed that this lens has the same specs but a higher zoom while being priced similarly would there be any drawback besides the lens size in getting this one instead or am i oversimplyfing lenses     
  what the fuck is that price  that lens right there has almost the same sharpness and corners as the 1855 at the same settings yeah i would get that one instead
    wait nevermind im dumb and i dont know german id pay maximum 250 euros for that lens  dont really know much about that lens in particular but sharpness should be fine between 18130mm
im thinking about getting the a7ii or iii the latter mainly because of the two card slots better button placement and much improved focus and contrast point at any rate sony fe lenses are fucking expensive so im thinking about what to buy     i mainly shoot indoor events at the moment sometimes with rather low light and portrait i was thinking about getting a tamron 2470 since the kit lens will just fail at the low light performance but that leaves me with barely any budget for a decent portrait lens i just saw an offer for an old takumar 125 f25 m42 plus adapter which was rather cheap but the sharpness doesnt blow me away and want to upgrade mainly for that purpose ive used micro four thirds cameras until now for convenience and value for money    what affordable portrait lens solutions for the a7ii/iii do you recommend i dont care about af compatibility flareing ca or vignetting as im going to shoot the portraits indoor mostly    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makeolympus corporationcamera modelem10markiicamera softwareadobe photoshop lightroom classic 75 macintoshmaximum lens aperturef/40focal length 35mm equiv80 mmimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution240 dpivertical resolution240 dpiimage created20181118 122053exposure time1/1600 secfnumberf/40exposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating4000lens aperturef/40exposure bias07 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length4000 mmcolor space informationsrgbrenderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardgain controlhigh gain upcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal
  ah thought that it was a 70300mm for some reason but its the 55300 dx vr version
  all these upgrade and not a single good photo from sonyposters
should i pick up a sony alpha 7 with a 2870mm lense for 749
  go for the a7ii instead
  i cant afford a camera that costs 14k the alpha 7 i is on sale thats why im thinking about picking it up
  the a7ii is on sale too 999 for the camera plus the kit lens  the a7 is a really unattractive option because it doesnt have image stabilization
    anyone
  go for the 2875 tamron thats considered the best economic allrounder
    as i said i want to get that anyway but i also want a tele portrait lens thats what the question was about
  i think sigma has a sale going on right now that might be something to look at thats still somewhat inexpensive legacy glass is also an option of course
  dont buy that cam for afordable options if you dont have for the bankbusting native lenses it has rather spend a little less on some canon body and top lenses picture youll get will be infinitely better
    personally i like the fe 85mm 18 very light amazing wide open could be difficult indoors if you dont have much working distance to the model
  i have heard good things about that too and given the price point right now it might be a strong option
what do you look for in a dslr body that makes it better than others frame size resolution some unmeasurable difference in quality between brands  i want to upgrade from my nikon d3300 and i dont know what to look for exactly
  apsc vs full frame  burst rate   video capability  resolution  weather sealing  low light performance  size/weight  af performance  etc etc     if youre at a point where youre looking to spend significant money to upgrade from a more entrylevel body you should definitely consider what exactly you need a camera to do that yours isnt doing its often much more significant to upgrade/buy more lenses rather than a new body  virtually any modern dslr body is extremely capable from an image quality standpoint
  controls how easily it lets you get the shot this is paramount     does it have good autoexposure controls can you easily override them when it fucks out hows its autofocus can you override that when it fucks up how does it feel in your hands can you access the control dials easily is it set up such that important settings get changed accidentally when youre carrying it does the menu system let you get to important settings quickly and easily are there customizable buttons you can use to make it fit your shooting style even better    below all of these things hows the image quality     cause just about any apsc or better camera made in the last decade or so is going to have great image quality
  important  what lenses can i use with the camera are the lenses i want available for the it/the system can i afford them
i cannot think of a more useless camera accessory than this 149 power zoom adapter that only works on literally only one kit lens in the entire world my managing editor made me buy this thing because she didnt like how manually zoomed shots looked it wasnt out of pocket but i am still irrationally angry at this fucking pos    dont buy this boys there are two zoom speeds and even the fast zoom is incredibly slow dont even get me started on the slow mode i wish it was compatible with any lens and that it had a much faster zoom speed at that point i could justify spending 75 on it
  what lenses can i use with the camera are the lenses i want available for the it/the system can i afford them  very good point that i forgot to mention thanks
im a casual that wants to get into photography as a hobby and for travel ive done some research into gear already but wanted to get some more opinions i can afford to drop a decent amount of cash into a mirrorless even though i know as a newb it might be better off to start with some el cheapo gear to learn techniques fuck it though if it doesnt work out ill sell the gear for a small loss  since im mostly interested in still photography im leaning towards fujifilm xe3 with a xf 23mm prime i see a lot of hype for sony a6x00 as an allinone package but ive read that fuji  sony for stills is that correct
went and tested the 5d4 and d850 today the 5d4 had the 24105 and the d850 had the 2470 since i couldnt decide between the two here are some thoughts    the d850 thumbhole spot was horribly close to the outer edge of the camera and made it actually kind of awkward to hold  however  the d850 did have much much better dial locations    the dial on the front of the 5d4 was really awkward to use because of how you have to bend your index finger upwards away from the rest of your hand whereas the 850 its right in front of the shutter button  also the fact there was only one dial was strange and in my quick fingerfuck test i couldnt find how to use the backside dial to adjust anything if youre shooting full manual it could be tougher to use in a hurry    so all in all the 5d4 was much more comfortable to hold but seemed slightly harder to use the technical differences were completely unnoticeable to me in my test both focused blindingly quick both had good range both were usable at 10k iso if you werent cropping in too much i think anyone that tells you to buy the 850 over the 5d4 is an idiotic gear fag    the only thing you need to consider with bodies of this calibre are whether having convent fingertip controls outweighs the comfort of having a more stable handgrip and if youre already invested into a lens system or if you prefer one lens brand to the other everything else is so unnoticeable that it doesnt even need to come into consideration
  how ironic i actually like the thumbhole spot to be closer to the edge i have small hands though
  man ive always found the nikon way of placing the front dial to be insanely uncomfortable compared to canon like i need to readjust my whole grip to turn the nikon dial but just move my finger slightly for canon especially if im holding the camera in one hand     im not sure if im somehow holding the nikon wrong or if my hands are just built weird i cant imagine everyone else feels the same way i do or nikon wouldnt keep putting their dials there maybe i just have enormous sausage fingers or something     one dial  i also prefer the canon way of having two very distinct types of wheel keeps them more separated in my brain and both wheels turn more smoothly than any nikon ive ever owned

  on the 850 it would probably still be a problem because it truly is a heavy mother fucker especially with a heavy lens on as well getting a full grip was neigh impossible
i just got an 80d and my wife is getting me the 1740mm f/4l as an early christmas gift whats a solid tripod option also should i try to find a portrait adapter to take portrait style photos on the tripod or get a tripod that articulates 90 degrees
  the vast majority of ballheads will have a portrait notch although if the tripod isnt on level ground youll need to adjust the leg length to get the camera perfectly straight or flip the camera so its grip down instead of up
when you get a dslr and realize you dont really go anywhere or shoot anyone with it
  go places meet people photograph them there
just got a a6000 on black friday having a blast with it so far going to nyc tomorrow for vacation hope to snap some cool photos i picked up some extra batteries and a cheap case interested in getting a cheap 50 mm prime even if its old glass any recommendations
im stuck at a decision that i cant quite make my mind up on i know that of my next 2 lens purchases i want the 70200mm l lens and the 2870mm l lens but i cant quite decide which one first buying used because im a poorfag suggestions or rationale behind picking one over the other i shoot mainly people inside but sometimes like to take walks and snap animals
  the sigma 30mm 14 is probably one of the best lenses for sony apsc e mount     
  why not just buy a lens with power zoom
  just get one based on what you do more of if you do more indoor people get the 2470
    you know i actually think youre right ive thought about this and there really is no point if i cant afford the lenses sad but true     in that case i have no clue which dslr to get maybe you could help me out    im looking for a cam/lens combo with the following priorities    full frame  not extremely heavy/overly huge lenses since im shooting with people who can be intimidated by big cameras  tiltable screen ideally at least 3 axes doesnt need to be touch  affordable lenses  balance between photo/video quality good frame rate/resolution for video ie if only hd then at least really good frame rate minimal if at all any video crop  good lowlight performance    nice but not extremely necessary  2 card slots  microphone jack  wifi    if any kindhearted dslr fags could help me out id be grateful
  what camera and what do you want to do with it
    alternatively would an adapter for affordable canikon lenses be a good workaround
  pentax k1 and dfa 2470/28 or dfa 50/14
  what camera do you have right now  will you be able to use your lenses on any of these
ive had a 550d for the longest time since launch basically and it has served me well im not super professional or anything i use a g7 for video work also i used my friends d90 the other day with a dx 18100mm and it felt so good the pictures i was getting off the camera had this depth to them and i felt like i was getting better dynamic range than i normally get with my 550d whats the deal
  first think of why you need full frame given how unsure you are of what you actually need i highly doubt you need it at all
  thanks for helping unfortunately there isnt a big used market for pentax in austria so ill have to work with nikon or canon
    i need it for image quality mostly its also a question of investment for the future with full frame becoming more affordable i feel like smaller sensor sizes arent worth the investment if i think about building a good collection of lenses
  canon rebel t5 lol i have the cheap nifty fifty for canon which is always ff however as part of getting a new camera i was going to get a lens with it as well i have some legacy primes which i could adapt in the meantime since manual is cheap to adapt and im comfortable enough with manual focus at the moment i shoot on two lenses a 24mm/28 and 50mm/18 they both serve my needs well i have looked at the 6dmkii for canon but i really feel like once im spending over 1k on a body i really should invest in something that will allow for a better learning curve for longer the 6dii definitely has some limitations as far as user freedom goes from what i understand
  except the lens matters much much more and can be carried over between bodies actual iq doesnt really change much between apsc and ff youre better off getting a rabal and a 2470f28 than a 6d and an 18135 f4556
  try fotoplus in hungary or srs microsystems in te uk until brexit
    also there is photo köberl graz as well
    im currently using the oly em10ii with a m zuiko 1240 f28 one of the best widetotele zoom lenses for micro four thirds the question remains what investment would most improve my overall picture quality and i dont think getting a rebel would be a big improvement but i take your advice seriously    do you think the a7ii with the 2870 3556 oss kit lens would be an improvement the problem is there arent really good zoom lenses in that focal range for sony fe yet the f4 barely seems like a much better option than the kit lens seeing that ill shoot mainly indoor with murky lighting a canon 28 with an adapter perhaps
  a7ii  get the tamron with that its the best option its been mentioned often enough in this thread already
  im currently using the oly em10ii with a m zuiko 1240 f28  i ran into someone using that setup a while ago its a really nifty little kit  what are you not getting out of that you would want from a different system
  the cameras arent even in the same price and group bracket   the d90 has better photos and worse video lower resolution and build quality helps as well with the feel of the camera  nikonand almost everyone else for that matter has better sensors but not enough to make a difference probably just the lens thats making the differences because afaik they both use strong aa filters  id say that your canon is a tiny bit more usable than the d90 but thats just my opinion
i am looking tog et a mobile background system like pic related  since ill be taking that to events ill need to be able to photograph groups of people as well so it needs to be big enough to do more than just headshots and a single person  what size will i need is there a system that folds down really small  is there a brand to prefer
how is a g9x mark 2 for a beginner i want something small portable and better than my phone camera a dslr is too big  my budget is around 400
  its aight if you can get an rx100 iii thatd be better second hand if you need to you get a faster lens a tilting screen an evf and better battery life its a little bit thicker but will still easily slide into trouser pockets
  the new in 2008 d90 was a 1400 camera back when it was announced and the 18105mm vr is still listed at dxo ad one of the best dx zooms available    new in 2010 the 550d was a 900 kit and the 1855mm is that came with it was one of the worst kit lenses in modern times
  yeah thats a little pricier so i would have to buy used but i will consider it  what do you think about mirrorless cameras i found the a6000 on amazon for around 450 and it comes with a small lens it looks compact enough for me as well
i have an old canon 60d but the focussing is utter shit on this and im bored of it ive gotten quite into photography and i need to upgrade when i get my 500 new years bonus at the end of the year so im gonna gift myself a new camera and go to russia to travel recommend me a good camera that is in the price range of around 1400 with a lens     im looking for   sharpness is my priority im in awe when im browsing 500px or flickr and i see very sharp detailed images of asia or forests or something so i really want that my 60d is way too soft in a lot of areas unfortunately   low light performance for travel shots ill use tripods but i wanna get into portrait photography indoors    good focussing i dont want to see something nice and want to take a pic of it only to wait for like 6 seconds for the camera to a utofocus and even then it cant move or it will do the thing all over again ugh looking for something that is just click  beep  snap   i prefer dslrs over mirrorless   full frame is the plan    at the moment im looking at the 6d which costs 900 brand new and maybe get a 1740l or a 24105 f4 l off ebay with it the other options are a a7ii with the kit lens for 1300 and a nikon d610 but it costs a lot of money new and getting a lens with it will cost me more      what do you guys think
  go to russia to travel  world wide insurance that covers theft
  really am i gonna get robbed walking around moscow or saint peter
tfw i spent weekend researching what new camera to get got it narrowed down to a7ii with rokinon 35 f/28  just got a gr2 instead  feels good man
  i dont know but better be safe than be sorry
    no offense but if you had read the whole thread youd have seen that im considering the best cheap option the tamron is brand new and although affordable compared to most of sonys native fe lenses still expensive     im currently thinking about abandoning the zoom and just going for the sony 50 f18 which apparently isnt much worse than the zeiss 55 f18
  sharpness is my priority im in awe when im browsing 500px or flickr and i see very sharp detailed images of asia or forests or something so i really want that my 60d is way too soft in a lot of areas unfortunately  this has literally nothing to do with the 60d sensor buy a better lens before dropping several grand on a new camera the 60d is fine a cursory search for it on 500px would show you several sharp images with it
    its really awesome actually especially considering how incredibly small but still versatile the whole gear is im able to run around with a small satchel that holds the em10ii the zuiko 1240 and the amazing bang4buck oly 40150 kit lens 2 extra batteries and a flash if the light isnt too low i can shoot everything i need without being too intrusive or photographery looking but my problem is the image quality if you have to crop which i frequently do and my boss expects top notch content the resolution quickly deteriorates becomes grainy
    are you joking
  no
  shitty little t6 and an eos a2 mainly portraits/people but some wildlife im also open to knockoffs that are really good too
  the power zoom 1650mm that lens probably isnt as good optically as the one on the rx100 and its slow enough that the rx100s faster lens makes up for the worse performance of the smaller sensor unless youre shooting in lighting conditions bright enough that you could have the a6000 at like iso 100200     if youre only going to stick with one lens sounds likely as size is a concern for you then it doesnt make any sense to get the larger a6000 which will end up performing the same if not worse in most situations
ive got the 1740 that i use for landscapes but i want to get into automotive photography im considering either the 85mm zeiss sonnar 135mm zeiss sonnar 85mm l 135mm l or the 70200 28l iii thoughts im leaning toward the 135 sonnar 135l or 70200 i know the former two would be sharper but the 70200 gives so much more utility
hi guys  i dont know many things about cameras i wanted to ask if that combo will work in my dslr     my dslr is sony alpha mount stla58     can i run this fish eye     with this adapter     if not  what are my options for a cheap a mount fish eye 
  that adapter is sony a mount to sony e mount theoretically you would need a c mount to a mount adapter for this lens doubt one exsists though focal flange distance on cmount is way way shorter so you would need an adapter with a correction lens      also the image circle a cctv lens produces is even smaller then apsc or m4/3    
  im guessing full frame if youre doing walk around stuff especially at car shows and meets where you might not have room to back up i wouldnt want to go much longer than 50mm 70200mm is more of a track side lens but going by your other options im guessing you wont be doing that have you not tried just using the 1740mm that would probably be the ideal range for me and then the 85mm for detail shots 135mm would be workable if its better optically
  that would be way to short for auto photography you ought to treat it like a portrait session
  cars are bigger than people have you actually tried it i went to a car meet about a week ago and only had my 50mm on me and there were a few times where i was having to back up close to other cars parked nearby or getting in the way of cars driving past it was workable but theres no way id want to be stuck with an 85mm or 135mm and be trying to get full car shots    if youre doing set up shoots where you can choose where the car goes and have plenty of room to work with then sure go with the 135mm i dont see why the 70200mm would ever be considered
  set up shoots  obviously    70200  because versatility can be nice to have for nonprofessional shooting
  obviously  it werent that obvious bub automotive photography could be set up shoots car meets and shows or track days    because versatility can be nice to have for nonprofessional shooting  you mean for other types of shooting if you need a 70200mm for that then get that if theres a particular reason why youre considering getting something then tell us were not telepathic
can i buy a cheap as fuck tripod from china and get the same results as paying stupid fucking prices for other tripods whats the difference any actual experience
  cheap knockoffs tend to be much thinner if theyre made out of actual aluminum so they will bend more easily and wont be as steady under windy conditions otherwise yeah theyre generally fine just dont expect it to last forever
  durability longevity weight weight holding capacity gimmick features not gimmick as in useless just not usual susceptibility to vibrations ease of operation a cheap tripod will get the job done a more expensive tripod can just make the experience more enjoyable and last longer
i have a pentax k50 with the 1855 kit lens its softer than babyshit however its nice for travel and snapshits     i owned the sigma 1750mm f28 for a few months and while the imagine quality was somehwere between the kit lens and a pentax a 50mm prime it was too big for snap shitting and not quite wide or sharp enough for the types of landscape and architecture photography i like    should i buy some limited glass for this camera or just jump into a new system entirely i feel like i made a mistake going pentax    could someone recommend a system and recommend two lenses for 1500
  17mm not wide enough  nigger what
  its fine to start on a cheap one im a couple of years into taking pictures and i havent felt the need to get a real one yet even though im aware that theyre much higher quality
  what if i want to do astrophotography if i just wanna take star pictures at night can i buy adapter boards that let me turn the camera up
should i get the tamron 70200 or wait for the new sigma nikon flagship is just too expensive
  as long as the tripod has a ballhead you can point the camera straight up
    if you want a 50mm and cheap rather than an 85mm old manual focus primes can be cheap and quite good turn focus peaking to red at max strength      its your lens fault wide angle you probably need to stop down to f/11 for sharp corners maybe f/8 okay too    additionally try manually focusing on a target with expanded live view for perfect focus just to check sharpness your af might be off and needing adjustment
  what kind of star photos what focal length    i managed to use my a7s with a 135mm and uhc filter on a nanotracker star tracker and got stuff like orions nebula its a lot of work though desu    wide angle is much easier
  on an apsc its more like a 24mm plus its not very sharp at 17mm
  24mm is wide and for wides i havent found any where you dont need to stop down to f/11 etc to get a sharp image across the frame even when i looked up the stupidly expensive loxia etc shit they all seem to do that
  some people like lenses wider than 24mm 18mm is nice anything more and its a fisheye
  ive had the 1224mm like a decade ago wasnt fisheye theres also rectilinear 10mm
  for now i just want dumb shit like the milky way against the mountains  a tracker mount would be neat but i assume id need to diy it if i wanted anything cheap
  nano tracker isnt that expensive i got mine on special but yeah i think ive had enough of it desu
hey /p/ never really come here so this seemed like the right thread to ask in instead of shitting up the board ive been using an older entry level canon dslr for the better part of a decade now and with the lenses i have it still works just fine for most of my purposes hobbyist who mostly takes photos as reference material for other hobbies but im looking into buying something a bit smaller to carry around ideally a flat or nearly flat form factor minus the lens like the slrs and rangefinder film cameras of old interchangeable lens is a plus but not 100 required i dont need wifi connectivity or gps or a flipout touch screen or pretty much any video capabilities so im fine with an older model however the dealbreaker is that i fucking hate electronic viewfinders even on newer mid to high end cameras they always just feel like shit to me and i get autistic over even the smallest visual lag when looking around not to mention the poor refresh rates that only get worse the busier or darker a scene is so obviously an optical viewfinder is my 1 requirement    ive done a fair bit of research but everything is pointing to a camera of this sort being just a pipe dream not only does my searching consistently fail me due to retarded site designs ie specifically search for cameras that have optical viewfinder checked and receive ten pages of evfs but it seems what im looking for just doesnt exist period does /p/ know of or have experience with any cameras that might match this description new or old or will i have to just stick with normalsized dslrs
  oh also raw shooting is a big plus but i dont know if other makes have the kind of custom firmware support to enable it on cameras that would otherwise be jpegonly like canon does with chdk and magic lantern
hey i own a d7100 and the viewfinder kinda sucks compared to other stuff i own but i really love this piece of garbage  what viewfinder magnifier is decent for it preferably something with a circular eyecup because square ones suck and are too close to the body
just jumped from canon and bought the fuji xt2 is the xt3 worth the extra 500 did i blow it
  if you dont need a hotshoe the a5100 is pretty cheap and ultra light    optical viewfinder will mean larger heavier bulkier cameras
  that camera doesnt have a viewfinder at all i mean im not entirely opposed to an evf if tech has really come that far in the past couple years and that they dont feel like playing quake on a 486 anymore but i greatly prefer optical even if it does add size and mass to the camera i was just hoping someone had figured out how to do that without needing a full dslr style body
  you need slr for optical view finder  alternatively there are ones you can mount on hotshoe but the viewfinder wont be looking through the lens eg for milc pic related    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop 70imagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution96 dpivertical resolution96 dpiimage created20140804 082806color space informationuncalibratedimage width565image height538
  damn that sucks theres no one making digital rangefinders other than lolca and their 4000 silver featureless boxes or compacts with offset viewfinders that dont necessarily line up with the lens itself thus not requiring the r part of slr
  compacts with offset viewfinders that dont necessarily line up with the lens itself  well that was the standard before slr  you can see many examples here   modern cameras got digital displays so the viewfinder was dropped
  its such a silly thing though is there really that small of a market of people who want the quick previews of shots and setting adjustment of a rear digital display but prefer the response or rather lack of artificial response and clarity of an optical viewfinder and want a camera similar in size to those older cameras instead of the now standard lshaped dslr body
    yes go to a store and test sonys evfs on the a7 and youll see why i used to be autistic about that too but completely changed my mind when i saw that the tech is actually this advanced
anyone knows a backpack thats similar to the lowepro mtrekker bp 150 but a little bit larger  looks like a normal backpack  opens from the back body but not from the sides and if from the top can be parted  secure  notebook sleeve 14  room for everyday carry stuff  no cheap budget chunk stuff    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpicolor space informationsrgbimage width370image height370scene capture typestandard
  guess its time i hit up some stores then drat in that case aside from the aforementioned sony whatre some of the best/most responsive evfs you or anyone else replying have used again dont really care about wifi or flipout screens or whatever but im assuming those are part of the package deal now if you want a new nonentirelyawful viewfinder    ive got some ef and efs mount glass from my babby rebel that has served me through so much but i dont think theyll get use no matter what with a different camera because canon seems perfectly content to sit on their ass and just make bookoobucks off the entry level rebels and the topend full frames and not a whole lot in between or below
  i use the lcd a lot since its larger unless there is a shit load of glare    but i prefer evf to ovf and i only have an a7s for several reasons    evf will show you waaaay more in low light situations than ovf where it starts looking dark or very dark in the ovf since it is very dark    expanded focus assist works in the evf and lcd and its full time you dont have to switch to live view like on a dslr    this is great for manual lenses    also there are some interesting lenses like the laowa 15mm f/4 11 macro lens which is insane but mirrorless only    i suggest trying out some of the cameras in a store where you can try the evf    i use the lcd 8090 of the time over the evf i find it more convenient and can watch my subject and surroundings and lcd at the same time prior to that id sometimes use the ovf on a dslr with both eyes open which was inconvenient thinking about both images at the same time that i was seeing overlapped    you can make a heavy or ultra light kit setup on these mirrorless cameras too depending on what you want    the samyang 24/28 and 35/28 are both under 100 grams each and are good performers    the a5100 i mentioned before  drawback of no evf and no hot shoe more important for me is around 200 gram mark i am considering it as a second travel and natural light body though
  also forgot to mention the new sony evf is 52 million dots not used in any cameras yet but i suspect on the next line with those two new rumoured sensors
  on the newer bodies the canon glass works very well adapted depending on the lens too i think also depending on if theyre worth keeping    evf benefits  brighter in low light expanded focus in evf itll also show you the focus tracking boxes etc iirc
  also depending on if theyre worth keeping  they arent im just a poorfag who has an attachment to what hes got and doesnt like spending more than necessary only two worth keeping are cheap as fuck anyway the 24mm efs pancake and 50mm ef revision 2 the last one before the freefloating focal ring on the current cheap nifty fifty does anyone really like those things what the hells the point at risk of sounding like a shill countershilling your sony recommendations im just used to canons controls and firmware and most familiar with how their cameras tend to perform in various conditions so basically anything will be a learning experience for me
mates    im currently using a nikon d3000 its a really old dslr form 2008/9 and ive recently bought a fuji x100 im a poorfag and jut want to know if it would be a good upgrade
i bought a samsung nx kit a couple of years ago and its doing its job fine but now that i want a new lens im actually finding them pretty rare  1 should i bother getting a new lens for a doomed mount for which no body or lens will be released   2 if im looking at getting a new body and lenses which mount could i get and not be bothered in 10/15 years by availability  or should it not be a concern but rather my nx experience being a rare occurrence 
  if youve already bought it its kind of a moot point no
should i get a nikon d300 with 200k clicks for 160 it comes with the 1855 kit lens  first dslr btw
  i am using a canon rebel xs another outdated dslr reading up on the x100 right now and it looks it will hold up be better than your nikon i am not sure sometimes i go out and shoot with an old nikon d1 that my uncle had and the pictures come out great and it is from 1999
  that is a cool camera to get handed down best of luck finding the right lens im jealous
  thats a lot of shots whats the shutter rated for and has it ever been replaced youll end up spending more on a shutter replacement than the camera cost look into a newer camera for like 300 and save yourself a headache
  about 300 for the shutter replacement 8 years ago lol   
  the shutter is rated at 150k its a tank of a body  its never been replaced       and
  are you retarded
  yes why
  and  and spending 460 all said and done after repairs on a d300  kit lens is not a very good deal
  i mean its a working camera it doesnt need any repairs yet
used sony nex 6  1650 kit for 165  good buy
  yes very good
  i dont need it though  except for flipping it
  true but when youre 50000 clicks over the shutters rated life expectancy its liable to happen at any given moment
  yep sounds like the deal of the year when it does break and it will dont come back here bitching that you cant afford it or that no one warned you
any one with experiences with 7 artisans lenses    im thinking about buying the 55 mm f/14 over the samyang 50mm f/14 to save 250 bucks
  soft all over  get the samyang instead
  still looking btw
what is the manufacturer that makes the best sense to to invest in the coming years the impression ive been getting is that sony has been constantly improving yet keeping a good price point yet lacking in glass is this correct
do you guys buy used grey market or on sale  i dont mind buying at the authorized store but most camera shops are in ny so i get charged tax which sucks
  leica
  if were talking mirrorless then sony has the most fleshed out lens line up both because theyve been doing it for so long and because they let third parties make lenses for their mount 4/3s mirrorless manufacturers do but im assumign youre interested in apsc or ff
  basically correct with more companies moving to mirrorless it might make sense to go that route if you arent already invested in a dslr system that said i still went for a canon dslr system because i dont care for mirrorless and they have the best first party lenses plus the form feels better in my hand truth is once youve decided between dslr and mirrorless just pick one of three big three that feels most comfortable for you to hold for extended periods the technical differences are so minor that on any computer screen or normal poster size print you wont be able to tell the difference
looking to get something for my sister to get rolling doing baby portraits im thinking something like a 700d with a 50mm prime    1 can that be accomplished for around 400450 with a decent prime    2 is that a stupid approach
  what many people dont get  sony makes excellent sensors but horrible cameras  all their cameras did horrible in anything but focus and image quality they are slow overheat dont have a lot of battery and generally have horrible layouts and now they want to fuck up their apsc line with that deformed body thats impossible to hold and balance too    leica l will probably be a valuable horse to set on wait until summer 3 manufacturers in an already developed mount system for both apsc and ff  panasonic has been keeping pace with sony in terms of hybrid/video shooting with a sensor half the size  sigma will port 14 existing lenses over to the new sensor and release with 8 completely new ones  panaleica will most likely form steppingstone lenses for the higher price range without touching the ridicolous prices of the existing leica lenses    leica l is a serious threat to sony come summer the two will most likely have staked 95 of the mirrorless market
  dont have a lot of battery and generally have horrible layouts  the a7 iii has the best battery life of any full frame mirrorless more than most if not all smaller sensored bodies too both canon and nikons offerings are much worse and i think nikon even had to use a larger battery than sony control layouts are largely personal preference sony isnt bad objectively better in some ways such as having more dials and no stupid touch slider and has a lot of customisation    and now they want to fuck up their apsc line with that deformed body thats impossible to hold and balance too  huh their apsc mirrorless bodies have always been quite small and havent really changed that much for example look at the nex7 and an a6x00
  its because sony has terrible coders  i remember they interviewed them on the xperia android line about how many they had working on updates for over 70 phones  11 yeah thats right 11   then you look at apple hiring the best software engineers money can buy and they are flawless despite using sony sensors which imo are actually licensed from us tech companies  honestly makes no sene to me but i guess thats whata global market is
  the a7 iii has the best battery life of any full frame mirrorless  thats like saying the sony a7 iii has the greenest housing of all full frame mirrorless    more than most if not all smaller sensored bodies too  all panasonic ilc batteries are physically bigger and carry more charge than the a7s    objectively better in some ways such as having more dials and no stupid touch slider  they literally have less buttons than the competition in the same price bracket from olympus and panasonic and their menu layout is horrible  they have no default switch to switch betwen mf and af they have no touchscreen for focussing they have the settings for timelapse a function which you had to buy on the a7ii buried deep within a menu  when turned on their camera takes ages to boot up  i used an a7 for a week before making my purchasing decision and that week was enough to make my hands hurt holding an olympus or fuji is heaven compared to that holding a panasonic is intuitive as fuck    watch this video where they actually put it right next to the competition dont worry they actually award the win to the sony despite them listing many drawbacks  
  thats like saying the sony a7 iii has the greenest housing of all full frame mirrorless  how so you said sonys battery life is shit yet theyre the best if youre comparing them to dslrs thats hardly fair    all panasonic ilc batteries are physically bigger and carry more charge than the a7s  and yet they have worse battery life the best i could find is the g9 with a cipa rating of 400 shots the a7 iii is 710
looks like the cheapest carcass i can get around a decent sensor is a sony mirrorless one of the nex line im thinking of biting on a nex5n with the kid lens and a camera bag for 180 local so i can inspect it  can i get a similar situation decent resolution maybe some video capabilities for under 100 lens included if im patient what would i have to sacrifice
  i think ive had enough of it  you can always donate it to me
  you said sonys battery life is shit yet theyre the best  yeah compared to other cameras in a similar category unless of course you exclude all competition out of fear of losing  a7 batteries are tiny even compared to batteries for much smaller sensors the bigger sensor cannot make that much of a difference panasonic already said theyll use even bigger batteries for their lmount cameras    and yet they have worse battery life   look at the video 3 pana batteries will get you through a day of filming and shooting with time to spare  of course when comparing pure shots its gonna look different sony cameras are designed to get the numbers in reviews as high as possible because everything sony ever does is to get the highest numbers as soon as you dont continually shoot and use raw the battery performance drops meanwhile lumix keeps up even while having dual is and a more demanding video format and a more powerful active cooling  dont look at ratings look at usage reports with more than just one camera being looked at
  yeah compared to other cameras in a similar category unless of course you exclude all competition out of fear of losing  theyre shit compared to their competition so the a7 iii has shit battery life compared to the eos r and z6/7 are you fucking delusional    when you compare apsc offerings they dont have as big a lead but theyre still at the top or comparable to their competitors fuji and canon compared to 4/3 they get overtaken slightly by the best bodies but its not a huge difference 400 shots vs 350 not something id call shit in comparison and if you do then the same applies to fuji and canon    yeah compared to other cameras in a similar category unless of course you exclude all competition out of fear of losing  what point are you even trying to make here no one can match the a7 iii battery life even with larger batteries according to you and smaller sensors just having a larger battery means absolutely nothing    dont look at ratings  the cipa rating puts each camera through the exact same scenario and varies the circumstances throughout the test to put a more balanced load on the camera it doesnt just see how many jpegs the camera can shoot in burst mode as you seem to imply
  its actually really fucking funny how you hang on to this tiny thread of sonys battery life you know its the only thing you can actually defend somewhat because sony totally sucks in every noniq area the moment canon gets their second generation out and panasonic releases their s1 sony is going to go bust or have to rethink their entire product development  literally the only reasons sony sold the a7s was brand loyalty and market monopoly only people who cant make decent products try to grab and hold on to a monopoly    just having a larger battery means absolutely nothing  lemme guess but having a larger sensor is totally important  more spacemore potential for charge at same density    the cipa rating puts each camera through the exact same scenario and varies the circumstances throughout the test to put a more balanced load on the camera  did you miss the story where several automobile companies have cheated tests in order to get higher rankings  dont ever trust tests these days the companies will tries to cheat them trust actual experience  sony is a shitty company from the treatment of their customers to locking people into their ecosystems trusting sony is dumber than trusting a serial child rapist with your daughter
    damn girl did your husband cheat on you with sony you mad
    i think its reasonable to criticize sony in certain aspects and at the end of the day everyone uses their camera slightly differently but to say the whole brand is garbage is really just a weak troll the a7 line is objectively at least very decent in comparison to the competition which is all you can ever reasonably compare a brand against
  lemme guess but having a larger sensor is totally important  considering it actually makes a difference yes its not so much that a larger sensor is better in some ways it is but in some ways a smaller one is better but sensor size is an important consideration when choosing a camera battery size isnt important battery life is    its actually really fucking funny how you hang on to this tiny thread of sonys battery life  if youre going to get things wrong im going to correct you and if you refuse to accept that you were wrong then im not just going to give up    you know its the only thing you can actually defend somewhat because sony totally sucks in every noniq area  they have the best af the highest burst rates that dont require you to lock af or exposure better and more customisable controls and more lenses they also have better video depending on what youre comparing them to    did you miss the story where several automobile companies have cheated tests in order to get higher rankings  cars / cameras  do you really think that sony has a hidden cipa mode in their cameras and it somehow detects when its being tested sony arent the ones doing the tests and activates it how do you think theyre getting more shots reducing power consumption in a way that only applies during the test
  leaked credit card information which got abused  and then tried to apologize with sony store credit
going to europe in february  want to take only one lens  would like to try a prime lens  interested in street photography landscapes famous sights castles parliament building etc   is the canon efs 24mm f/28 stm my best option
  its probably a pretty good choice yeah you could get that and the 40mm pancake if you wanted to have the choice of a longer focal length and still be carrying around less weight than a kit lens
  why  youre probably spending a lot of money to come to europe why wasting the opportunity of getting a wider range of compositions by restricting yourself to only bring one lens

  digital rangefinder  your choices are as follows leica leica leica and leica and your 5000 budget isnt enough
  oh yeah theres also the fuji x100 series but those have fixed 35mm lenses so i hope you like wide angle
  theyre not a rangefinder either so yeah i think his options are leica and leica      afaik and i might be wrong the only digital rangefinders are leicas and thats not a good idea unless youre stupid rich and just want a cool toy
  not the other anon id fucking jump on the x100 family if they were closer to a 50mm but 35 is just too wide for most of my use

the screen on my omd em10ii doesnt work if i tilt it down anymore is there an easy fix or is it fucked    it isnt the end of the world because i didnt use it that much anyway but it is annoying
  as in the connector loses connection if so it should be relatively easy to resolder
    theres also the epson rd1 series which is a heck of a lot cheaper than leica and also very old     but given the fuji he posted im guessing what hes actually wanting is a rangefinderstyle digital camera like a fuji in which case he should go ahead and get a fuji they even have a mode where you can manually focus with a virtual rangefinder patch in the evf
  yeah i took a look at the ribbon cable on the screen end and it doesnt appear to me moving out of place when i tilt the screen so the issue might be on the body end instead

redpill me on pentax  are they just another brand or are they a dark horse in the camera industry
  x is a meme is a meme
  they are the dslr equivalent of fujifilm  both mainly sell apsc  both have mf options    the difference is just that pentax has near 0 budget for development and k1 mark 3 is likely just the same 36mp camera with a firmware update
currently shoot with a canon 60d was wondering if the canon 1755 usm lens is any good
at the moment i have an olympus em102 with the two kit lenses a panasonic 15mm f17 and an old tamron macro lens with an adapter     on a recent trip i found myself mainly using the 15mm lens for a lot of shots of buildings but looking back i usually prefer the compression effects from the 40150mm lens is there a lens that covers the gap between these two with a pretty fast aperture this removes the other kit lens from the running unfortunately
  ive only ever found one reason to pick pentax over any other brand     at a given price point they used to have some extra nice features like weather sealing or image stabilization which canon and nikon didnt but they also waited way too long to add a full frame body which meant that your pentax upgrade path was limited to midrange cameras theyve got a ff body now but its kind of too little too late especially with everyone coming out with mirrorless full frame now     that being said you can some midrange pentax bodies in ridiculous color schemes like yellow/pink for that alone its worth picking up a pentax otherwise just get a nikon canon or sony
  they were close to greatness but fell into the darkness    they are losing steam hard third party support is fucking off and they dont have a solid lens lineup excellent bodies but lenses are nowhere to be seen
  zoom speed prime lenses    why fucking bother
  do do you not understand that theres more to lenses than their apertures and focal lengths
does anyone know how the fuck to get a qs1  lenses in canada  i know ebay is an option but earlier this year pentax said theyd continue making and selling the current q lineup their site says they have london drugs as a canadian distributor but last time i talked to someone there they said they couldnt order one    im eager to get one with a custom colour but if theres literally no hope in getting a new one here then im fine buying used id rather get the new if possible though
  their cameras use a lot of novel technology but they skip of marketing it properly  weather sealing  sr shake reduction  image stabilization in the camera body giving you this feature even in the cheap adapted 30 manual lenses  pixel shift starting with k3 ii 2015    from the minuses the choice of new lenses is limited and the weather sealed ones are only pentax brand lenses  the number of lenses overall is huge however if you include older and manual lenses for k mount there are 142 primes and 105 zooms get a pk/m42 adapter and you get access to 103 primes and 4 zooms this doesnt include 3rd party lenses and they are all viable choice thanks to inbody stabilization    good pick if you know what you are doing and have some special needs a worthy consideration if you are not a professional    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makenikon corporationcamera modelnikon d700camera softwareadobe photoshop lightroom 66 windowsphotographertayfun sertan yamanmaximum lens aperturef/17sensing methodonechip color areacolor filter array pattern814focal length 35mm equiv50 mmimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution240 dpivertical resolution240 dpiimage created20171121 151101exposure time1/25 secfnumberf/40exposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating1600lens aperturef/40exposure bias07 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flashfocal length5000 mmcolor space informationsrgbrenderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardgain controlhigh gain upcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormalsubject distance rangeunknown

i bought a nikon 1 j1 for my holidays  did i make a big mistake
  is the 1740 the best canon l lens when taking price into consideration
newfag here trying to round out my toolkit what do you guys think about pic related trigger finger is getting itchy so i might just order all of this today
  make sure your body has a focus motor to be able to have af with that lens
  you can get lena caps in any size cheap on amazon ebay etc just look at the filter diameter  if its about protection in general theres another thread about this topic allready
  100mm f/28l macro even moreso with the current 200 off
  70usd bag  what the fuck
  wide manual lenses are unicorns
  checked you need money to make money    the green lines get me gard i no lie but i read they cater mostly to midrange/semi pro i see they threw one medium format up there to catch some flies  was going for a canon m50 but i cant make up my mind    what you said reminds me of windows phone ton of potential and microsoft botched it by hiring poo in the loos for the coding that and 3rd party wont support you unless you are rolling    yeah that settles it come christmas time ill just pick up whats available  brand sounds like its reliable and its product will treat you well while you have it  now to buy used grey market or new hmmm  welp time to research thanks for the input guys
  brand sounds like its reliable  its the most unreliable of the bunch in terms of autofocus though    af is even worse than on modern mirrorless   think of it as a dslr that doesnt know how to be a real dslr

i n gear pruchase bts procy innit
i bought the new zeiss batis 2/40 cf eyeaf always misses focus i read up on it others report the same im kinda mad atm
  thats a shame the batis 25 was excellent as af speed    maybe it can be fixed in firmware
  some shit dont bother
  are you just being fussy or can you recommend something better pic related has a few useful features can be carried as a tote sling or backpack has flexible inserts so you can partition the space however you need to and has another bag inside so its really 2 bags for 70 usd im open to suggestions though im not married to this product and backpack mode looks retarded anyway
was thinking of going fullframe i currently use a canon 60d but was thinking maybe s 5dmark iv for anyone who has one how is it what do you love/ dislike
  would recommend the sony a6100 or equivalent itll get you started at least but with that budget id say you need a bit more for a good lens
  what there are hundreds on ebay al for less than 100
  smc pentxm 28/28 50mm/f17 or f14 100mm/f28 are all cheap  gud
  thanks mate do you know if the pentaxa 28mm is any good id quite like the automatic aperture control
  no experience w it but i understand optics are same as smc pentax m 28/28 later version  so if it is cheap no reason to not get it
    zuiko 1240 28 its pretty sweet used it in a trip to the desert recently and it did a good job on both landscape and portraits there
  i have one its pretty good nice and small well built and probably the smoothest focusing lens ive ever used

are there any obvious differences between nikon/nikkor lenses and the third party manufacturers such as sigma  tamron    looking to get a standard zoom lens like the nikon dx 1680mm f/284 but the price is fairly high found the sigma 1770mm f/284 that does basically the same thing but is 2x cheaper this got me thinking if its better to go for the native nikon lenses or if i should consider other manufacturers more the nikon lens is a kit lens for the d500 but from what ive read it has stellar reviews
  maybe ill sell my 15mm and trade up then    ill be missing a fast lens with that switch though maybe the panasonic 25mm 17 could fill the gap
  i dont have any recommendation but i would never in my sane mind buy a bag that costs as much as a lens  most of the features that bag provides are unnecessary any bag that has some decent level of weather and shock protection does the job  overall its hard for me to attribute value to a piece of tissue that has no electronic optical or mechanical parts its just a bag would never pay more than 15bucks for a bag
best colograding software  davinci resolve for film but what for stills    i know of 3d lut creator and jsut came across grossgrading which seems to be heavily unknown    how do you guys grade directly in you raw converter lightroom/photoshop raw capture one etc in photoshop
  the term color grading does not apply to photos
  although thinking about it i could probably manage with just a 28 at my disposal i doubt i would go through with switching to a 25mm for a few more stops
  what is it called then maybe i will find better results with google    inb4 some long as discussion about semantics again
  what exactly are you trying to achieve here most people just use lr/ps/c1 to adjust the color temperatures to their liking    and no i dont want to start some thing about semantics either but saying colorgrading in regards to still photography makes you sound like a newb
  what exactly are you trying to achieve here  finding a program that lets be color my pictures properly without banding and such stuff with an intuitiv and easy to use interface  photoshop or lightroom doesnt provide that
guy on craigslist is selling this for 200 is it worth it
  yes
is the difference between the sony a7 and a7ii worth 240   the main two differences i see are ibis and a bit more rugged body with a better handle
  also the ability to use phase detect af with adapted lenses video is also better if thats something youre into only you can really decide if those things are worth the extra money    for me i ended up getting a first gen a7 because i wanted the cheapest full frame mirrorless possible and ended up saving somewhere around 300 which ended up going towards lenses i couldve afforded the extra cost and do think it would have been worth it but i just didnt want to do it if that makes sense
  well looks like the question answered itself someone else bought the amazon warehouse deal for the a7ii so at a 600 difference im not considering the ibis      i ended up thinking that i would get it but someone else did beat me to it so whatever i guess
  look at this snob
  i figured at that price difference you were looking at second hand brand new that a7 ii wouldve been a steal

is the sony qx1 mirrorless worth it i am looking for something really portable and capable this comes to mind because of the convenience and ability to use lenses

neighbor has a rx100 v he wants to sell to me for 500 no damage fully functional minor cosmetic wear is that a fair price
lady locally is selling the following lens  afs dx nikkor 35mm f/18g   a d3100 for 75 total    im not interested in the camera as much as im interested in the lens since it looks like a decent prime lens  im thinking of getting a nex5n and im wondering if the lens ive listed is going to be better than the kit lens that comes with the nex5n if thats conditional what are the conditions that it would be better in    also if i did buy it and want to adapt it to the emount id just get a gtoe mount from somewhere right im fine with manual focusing
  search it on marketplaces and compare prices used prices seem to range from 650750 so 500 if shuttercount low or at least not high seems to be a very good price to me    ask for shittercount
  nikon dale use the f mount so you will need and f to e adapter   i dont think the lens has an aperture ring or manual aperture so i guess you will not be able to control it with a dumb adapter making it closed all the time
  fuck i think i see what you mean  got dannit bobbin i thought i was in for a schweet deel    maybe ill forgo the better idea of getting the nex5n and just buy this shiddy 3100 though all of that for 75 seems 2good2btru
1400 a7r iii on craiglist  dont have the money to buy it now
  gtoe adapter    f mount   aperture ring  actually in this case two wrongs made a right kinda     ie you can get a nikon g to sony e adapter which has its own aperture control which will let you use that 35/18 with manual focus and a manuallycontrolled aperture     that being said if shes selling that on craigslist or something youve already wasted too much time and the deal is gone thats a ridiculously good deal75 is a huge discount on that lens by itself even disregarding the camera thrown in for free
  actually in this case two wrongs made a right kinda   while the g lenses are the still the same physical f mount the g indicator means there is no aperture dial on the lens itself so while the g lenses will physically fit the standard f mount cameras and adapters there is no way at all to change the fstop on the lens  you lern something new every day      adapter which has its own aperture control  forgot about this how do these adapters work
  how do these adapters work  with gtype nikon lenses the aperture is set electronically in the camera but the actual linkage that controls the opening and closing of the aperture is still a physical linkagetheres a little bar on the lens side of the mount which opens and closes the aperture when you move it and that slots into the camera so the camera can change where it is     with the adapter the adapter just has a ring around it that pushes that little bar around     note that this wont work with the newest etype lenses which have a fully electronically controlled aperture like canon and most mirrorless lens mounts do or the newer afp lenses which are all focusbywire so need a live camera with electronic control to even use it in manual focus mode     the afp lenses dont even work with a lot of nikon dslrs that are a little bit too old like the d3200 nikon lens compatibility is kiiiind of a train wreck
  i see good to know thank you
just bought my first polarizer for a specific image in front of a glass pane    now i wonder are there any downsides to having it on the lens or can i just keep it on
    i want a medium format camera to take bigass avedonstyle portraits    and then as my daily    how dumb am i is it possible is it even worth it
  shoot lf film
  certainly possible whether its worth it is a personal decisionit would be cheaper and easier and image quality in the abstract would be better with a full frame digital but if you like that film look or just prefer working with a film camera then thats all that really matters     if you scour antique stores for a while you might be able to score a medium format folder for relatively cheap ive gotten two recently in good condition for under 30 just make sure that the shutter fires bellows are light tight and it uses 120 film if youre going for something like a tlr or medium format slr its gonna cost more i rarely see those for cheap but youre gonna have an easier time shooting with them cheap folders rarely have focusing aids other than a distance scale on the lens plus you cant change lenses and if youre going for avedonstyle youre probably going to want 6x6 instead of the 6x9 or 6x7 youll get from a folder if you get a tlr it makes a really good camera for street shots because no one in 2018 knows what the hell it is and the waist level finder means they dont realize youre pointing a camera at them     good luck
  walimex pro 500mm 163  thats not at all bad lens for its price however you need a pretty good tripod to and some nontrivial focusing skills to actually get good results even air currents start to blur images do you really need that reach    shorter tele with ois might be more practical to actually use dunno how expensive for fuji more than 2nd hand crop canon dslr and efs 55250mm f/456 is or something like that from other brands
  you were entirely right and it was already sold fuck me i didnt wait but she had just failed to mark it by the time i saw it  i really need to write some scripts or set some fucking notifications
what the fuck constitutes a godlevel vintage lens what makes a lens from that era better than kit lenses are there good zoom lenses or will prime lenses always be superior for the same focal length
  looked around a little currently considering the eos 2000d with the kit lense and a a tamron 70300mm
  1   2  depends on your metric  3 im sure a modern multicoated zoom lens is sharper than some uncoated sonnar
  yes there are good zoom lenses in fact most pros shoot on them youll recognise them by insane price tags and usually constant aperture
any idea where i should go to sell camera gear i have a new a7riii  2470gm with a full us warranty want to get rid of them ebay fees absolutely destroy how much i could get out of them
  and why do you want to get rid of them exactly
  a good vintage lens can have moar aperture than kit and either is sharp wide open or is not that sharp but has character and memey bokeeeeh for 50  there are also plenty vintage lenses which are just old crap    honestly for nonpoor people a modern prime or prosumer f28 zoom is more practical
  id get instead a 2nd hand midrange kit but i admit it is because my prejudice against entry level
  you can also get goat sharp lenses with goat bokeh for cheap problem is that people dont like to share what these steal lenses are since as soon as some idiot starts praising them too much they jump prices
im going to a runway in a few hours i dont have a lot of experience and i just have two lens  55200/56  1855/3556  which should i take with me

  this was also a very sunny bright scene
  well eos 2000d will do the job and give same image quality as more expensive crop canons   put your monies in lens it is the important part you may grow out of your camera body but not from a good lens
  did you maybe lock exposure on something bright by accident
  yeah should be something like that check ael lock button and exposure offset options in the menus
  i know this lense is cheap 95 and will not result in the best image quality  my plan is to buy a good lense with a focal length range somewhere between the kit lense and the cheap telezoom at a later point in time  the issue is that i dont have the money for something like the canon 70200 and i will probably not use focal lengths this long for most shots
    not that i can see heres something interesting the viewfinder gives a different shutter speed than live view under the same aperture but both end up far too dark it seems liek the camera cant get the aperture big enough but i can see clearly through the viewfinder yet live view is dark as hell
  welp im returning it for a refund looks liek theres a common fault where the aperture solenoid fails so bugger that   annpoying ive already ordered a 28mm mf pentax lens are there any mirrorless pentax apsc cameras

  its a mirrorless camera with no evf and is the same size as a dslr so it has the bad aspects of both a dslr and mirrorless iq is not bad though for 16 megapickles good luck using old manual focus kmount lenses however
  good for a light camera and a short lens but thats about it
  same sensor as a d7000 or nex6  both of those are better and probably about the same price

  look up the definition of professional first  doesnt know the definition of professional before posting
    i would get an ilc from fuji with the 23mm lens instead it makes it easier to clean if you can remove the lens the x100f is not weather sealed
    the x100f is an excellent camera but its really a fit to only one or 2 genres of photography     it would not be a good only camera
  the x100f is an excellent camera but its really a fit to only one or 2 genres of photography  its great for street event and travel photography also great for a lot of nature photography simply because of its size/weight ie youre more likely to be able to comfortably bring it on a hike than say a d850 and bag full of glass    if those are the sorts of things you mainly shoot itd be fine as an only camera
are you a pajeet or something
i was also thinking of picking one up when they get cheaper do you guys think i should get it in silver or black which colorway fares better with wear/scratches i like black because its inconspicuous but silver looks nice
honestly you may as well just get the original x100 and see how you like it then upgrade if you think youll enjoy it the original is still real good and you can get it for like 300 on ebay if you hunt around     if it fits into what kind of things you like to shoot then think about upgrading otherwise you can just keep it and not be out much money or you can sell it and probably get your money back obviously if you get the x100f you could sell that too but the problem there is its more likely to depreciate since its newer
    you know you can rent cameras right
  weather sealing is a meme
  thats not a professional camera    it has almost zero versatility    the lens is poor    jpegs are for journalists and dadtographers would you pay a professional artist to fill in a painting by numbers taking the photo is only half the job accepting the sooc jpeg is accepting that you have zero creative vision    buy an a7 range camera instead it has an almost identical form except it is a professional camera with professional results

  being hip    were talking about photography here not fashion accessories /fa/ is more for you sweetie
  thats not a professional camera  professional camera is not a standard classification so anything can be one the x100 series has an apsc sensor full manual controls raw support and a fast prime lens all of which are features generally associated with pro photography    it has almost zero versatility  obviously if you define versatility as lens options thats true but thats a dumb way to define versatility and youre dumb for defining it that way     the lens is poor  the lens is perfectly fine     jpegs are for  it shoots raw too     buy an a7 range camera instead  that wont fit in a jacket pocket with an equivalent lens attached plus it would be significantly more expensive especially when factoring in the price of the lens

  gear doesnt matter if the composition and subject are strong enough but you were caught making up bullshit about a photo you didnt know anything about so i had to correct that when i noticed the specs on their site i didnt say anything about it being taken unnecessarily on a pro camera     anyway thanks for the bait
  the only real downside i can think of is the lack of weather sealing which is strange considering this camera is otherwise perfect to be carried daily but its not a huge problem if youre careful with the camera and watch out for bad weather and moisture

  ive had my x100f for almost a year now and its honestly been great so far    out on the street people are much less put off by this than my nikons or even my digital leica desu plus its almost silent with the mechanical shutter     the whole film simulation actually isnt a gimmick either its honestly been really useful on fuji i dont even shoot raw anymore just jpeg with minor color correction its saved time in post for me at least    the x100f also has that leaf shutter and built in nd filter those are definitely nice to have for portrait shoots and two things i definitely take advantage of     if 35mm is how you shoot almost everything then its definitely worth considering keep in mind too that fuji does make converters for 28mm and 50mm i have the 50 and it certainly does perform as well as fujis 35mm 50 equiv f2 the f certainly has benefits over earlier x100s too for me at least having acros classic chrome and the joystick make it totally worth it just beware of the mf ring its hot garbage

    heres one prerequisite of a professional camera redundancy two card slots     the x100f is a consumer grade camera     xt2 owner
i would much prefer an xt2 with a 23mm lens although it does cost more than the x100f it also has more features and weather sealing
  nice photo do you have a blog
  butt  lol
  cant tell if youre taking the piss or if you seriously think this
  what do you mean your nikon f3p doesnt fit two rolls of film what is this a glorified kodak funsaver fuckin pleb
    the x100 gets that lovely leaf shutter too which has some appeal to a lot of folks     high speed sync without all the bullshit pretty cool
  dust will probably be stuck in the sensor sooner or later and youll be forced the shell out a couple hundred bucks to have it repaired
  so youre a refugee
  only worth it if youre buying new
  weather sealing is a meme
  i was also looking at the ricoh gr ii as a cheaper option it does have lots of positive reviews
  but no nd filter which i like a lot about the fuji
  the gr is an entirely different kind of camera  i absolutely love mine but it feels and handles very differently from an x100      the gr does have a builtin nd
    false analogy completely different medium with different practical implications it has been demonstrated that two card slots can be easily engineered into a camera fuji even do this themselves and it is a central distinguishing point between their professional range and their consumer products         digital data loss is a real threat you would know that if you had ever shot a job most clients and insurance policies will stipulate that two card slots are used or youre out of the game imagine being liable for losing an entire shoot because you decided to shoot with a consumer camera
  most clients and insurance policies will stipulate that two card slots are used or youre out of the game      to be blunt     horseshit
what is a good alternative to this expensive camera love the look and spec of the x100f since i shoot a lot of concerts and need something discrete but im not ready to shell out more than 1000
  as mentioned before the x100
is the x70 a viable cheaper option compared to the x100t
  if youre really into wide angle shooting maybe but not for most people     i think the x70 whips ass and i love mine but its a much less versatile focal length than what you get with the x100 series
  i bought one for fun after owning three canon cameras 5d mark iii being one of them and plenty of l glass it is an extremely good camera and absolutely worth the money paid for it
  and also there is the ricoh gr iii coming
  18mm
  but sony has no soul
i recently bought the x100f and couldnt be happier ive been using an a6000 for the past few years and it has been great considering the form factor yet i felt like something was missing the x100f has a certain feel and aesthetic about it that my a6000 cant match including image quality   tip do not buy this camera for anything other than street photography or a pick me up and go travel camera    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce6000camera softwareilce6000 v320maximum lens aperturef/50focal length 35mm equiv51 mmimagespecific propertiespixel compositionunknownhorizontal resolution240 dpivertical resolution240 dpiimage created20181102 202823exposure time1/125 secfnumberf/56exposure programmanualiso speed rating6400brightness07 evexposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length3400 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width6000image height4000renderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal
  what about landscape photography its not good for that purpose
  if i know im going to be shooting landscape i ask myself specifically what kind i will be shooting and what feeling i want to convey in the pictures  if i want a fish eye look with as much info on screen or print as possible then ill bring my 16mm prime for my a6000 see pic related   the x100f is a great landscape camera as you can can get amazing shots with 35mm and the teleconverter fuji wide lens if you want an equivalent of a 23mm  all questions aside i love my x100f you wont regret buying it as it will last you a lifetime    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce6000camera softwareilce6000 v320maximum lens aperturef/35focal length 35mm equiv24 mmimagespecific propertiespixel compositionunknownhorizontal resolution240 dpivertical resolution240 dpiimage created20140320 160343exposure time31666/39582501 secfnumberf/50exposure programnormal programiso speed rating100brightness106 evexposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length1600 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width5678image height3665renderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal

  why does this look softer than a cell phone image
  slight post edit for a look i wanted
    the horizon in your image is distorted it looks pretty bad
  thats what i get for using my 16mm kit lens thanks for the naked eye i will fix
    why are you posting sony images but praising fuji    so confused
im torn between x100f and xe3
maybe i have pudgy fingers but i dont understand how anyone can find the aperture ring comfortable on the x100 series  it is so fucking close to the body that i feel my hand cramping after a few hours   i wish they would just allow us to make the front command dial the aperture dial
  that barrel distortion    woah
  i had a similar dilemma is the x100 going to be your only camera get the xe3 already have a camera system get the x100f
  its not barrel distortion hes just close to the edge the earth has to curl up at the sides a bit or all of the water would fall off
    i get better results with the inexpensive canon 1018 some crop sensor cameras are a little better than others but not that much its the lenses that are available and the controls you want on your camera that are important thats why i do like fuji cameras although you could go full frame for the same amount of money
  its complicated  i started out with a nikon dslr wanted something smaller/more compact and got a really nice deal on an old x100   since that i havent touched my nikon dslr at all   i leaning towards xe3
  xe3 with 27mm is a nice combo    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution240 dpivertical resolution240 dpicolor space informationsrgb

  show me your blog pls
  why do you keep posting those completely unrelated sony pics man
        
bought the x100t off craigslist yesterday very excited to try it out
  im interested to know how you find the viewfinder
  is to just or did this dumb fujitard mount his hood vertically
  definitely going to take a bit for me to get used to it considering ive only ever used canon dslrs before
  lol fuck
  do you like your single hand strap im still using my sling strap and im skeptical
ive owned them all  x100 classic beautiful images straight out camera usable af after fw upgrade laggy screen/evf but i use ovf 90 of the time cheap bought a back for 210 quid    x100s images not as good out of camera waxy skin at high isos bigger screen  worse af than x100c  sold after 2 days    x100t everything is fasterbetter screen etcevf in ovf hybrid which is nice to have on my xpro 2 but redundant on x100 in overall use xtrans ii has better dr but again waxy skin at high iso had for about 12 months    x100fxtrans iiiacros better than previous xtransaf isnt that much faster than x100t imobut overall better package and images are back to being nice again but as i own a xpro 2 and prefer the versatility for manual lenses/focal lengths and the faster af and wrsent it back  i still own a x100 classic to this day the upgrades do not justify 4x the price
  how was the image quality of the t  im thinking of getting one to replace my xe2  23 f2
  i use it a lot usually when im wearing a coat that has big enough pocket or if im explicitly going out with the intention to shoot in which case ill just hold it in my hand when im wearing a lighter jacket or no jacket i wear the shoulder strap and sling it over my shoulder under the jacket or across my shoulder seems to work well
  cool i keep being tempted to buy the original just got the fun of it even though i already have an interchangable fuji system
  its identical since it has the same sensor and the lens is pretty much the same
  same guy here i think the original has a certain special thing going on i find myself picking it for personal use over the xpro 2
  yup same sensor obviously if you want the ovf and something more compact then sure why not
should point out if shooting raw with iridient or c1 you wont get much issue with waxiness/high isojust seems to be a jpeg issue more than anything overall theyre all greatexcept the s i feel
    i heard that the 23mm f2 has more character microcontrast and  magic compared to the x100 series lens    to me that just all sounds like untestable meme qualities but it doesnt hurt to ask you guys i guess
  the useability and how much you enjoy using the camera would make a much bigger impact on your photography than something like microcrontrast or character    any of those can easily be manipulated for in lightroom anyway
  x100 guy the 23mm f2 lens has a more clinical look and more contrast i think its quite a boring lens at timesthe x100 lens has a more characteristic old lens attributes crazy flares in sunlight the 23mm f2 is a little bit wider compared to x100s lens pic is x100 flare in action    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makefujifilmcamera modelfinepix x100camera softwareadobe photoshop lightroom 571 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/20sensing methodonechip color areaimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution240 dpivertical resolution240 dpiimage created20181010 214635exposure time1/1000 secfnumberf/20exposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating200lens aperturef/20brightness86 evexposure bias13 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length2300 mmcolor space informationsrgbrenderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardsharpnesshardsubject distance rangeunknown

hey fujibois what would be a better combo    fuji 23/14  fuji 35/2  or  fuji 23/2  mitakon 35/095    both cost about the same in total dont care that much about af or wr would like 1 or 2 stops extra for low light on at least one of the lenses
  mitakon
  i bought one but i use my leica m6 so much more often so im probably going to resell it on ebay within the next couple days
bump
  leica m6    cool
  heh
  i think the original has a certain special thing going on    its called a bayer array
  i hope you dont think the xt2 is professional
  having a functioning camera is a meme
  it will last you a lifetime  bullllllshit  i have one and love it but this is actual autism
  sony kit lens        if i could go back i have x100t id 100 get an xe3 over x100 series the optical viewfinder is 100 meme ive never found any reason to use it over the evf
  shit what hood is that ive been looking for a square one that doesnt look rarted it looks like you did get it on vertically tho
  do you like the form factor at least  the xf 23mm f/2 is gigantic compared to the x100 series 23mm
  yeah its a nice form factor i would get a xf 27mm f28 pancake lens if i were to get the xe3 though not the big 23mm x100xs arent bad at all but they tend to be more expensive and theyreless flexible
    xf 23mm f2 is not big its light and just as easy to carry around as the 27mm although its three times longer its effectively the same experience
  definitely recommend an xe3 and 27mm     its a sharp lens reasonably fast aperture a good intro to the fuji system lenses and highly portable
18mm  27mm
  xf18mm  this makes pixel peepers mad    i cant stand the focal length personally of the xf 18mm im trying to sell mine
lol
  unless you give it away close to free you cant sell it too cheap to buy new grey market with warranty vs used    embrace the meme focal length
  man this comment made me so sad that i started looking for fixed 28mm lenses for my camera i wanna shoot that field of view for a while
  yeah people keep trying to buy it for 150 eurobucks stop buy it for 250 please
can this camera zone focus well what i am afraid of is trying to zone focus with this camera at shows and accidentally moving the focus ring
  no it kinda sucks for that theres no focus scale on the lens its not actually a physical focus ring but a focus by wire
  it has a proper depth of field scale in the viewfinder so very easy to check if youve moved focus
  if you use a hood/filter adapter its pretty difficult to move the focus ring intentionally let alone accidentally
  for how much

  i bought one returned it a week later colour science is a fucking joke and the lack of compatibility made editing even more tedious than normal    an overpriced toy for masochists and morons
  what do you use instead then
    sony a7iii and a7sii once you have them setup the ergo is phenomenal and the lenses are infinitely better than the ridiculously dated designs from fuji
  sounds cool looks like sony is now epic
  once you have them setup the ergo is phenomenal  you are lying sonygger shill sonys are bricks i know i own one
  i own one    prove it faggot
  i dont have to prove anything to you how am i gonna prove that the sony is bad ergo anyway by holding it and it falling out of my hand idiot
  once you have them setup the ergo is phenomenal  oof i guess i cant speak for the a7iii and a7sii but i own an a7ii and the ergonomics are crap     eg   1 changing your active focus point takes three button taps minimum   2 the eye sensor is too sensitive which means the rear lcd turns off if youre holding the camera low and close to your body  3 there are five separate customizable buttons c1c4 center down with nothing assigned to them by default the functions available to assign to these buttons are weirdly limited i literally cant find anything i want to assign to c4 there are a bunch of things that id like to assign to it like monitor/evf swap to mitigate 2 but those arent options     also sony doesnt make any compact lenses eg something akin to the canon 40mm and 24mm pancakes or even sonys own 16mm for crop which means you kind of lose one of the main advantages of mirrorless and they dont make a decent fast normal lens for under a grand my canon 50/18 on an mc11 is much faster to focus and the combo cost nearly the same as the sony 50/18 oh and the canonmc11 is the same size as the sony 50 alone    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertiesimage orientationrighthand topimage width4032image height3024

  samyang 35mm is pretty compact no
  true and that does mitigate the issue somewhat for the system as a whole but doesnt negate my point that sony doesnt make a pancake for fe mount
  just gonna leave this here
  same here    the sensitive eye sensor thing you can kind of fix if you take a piece of electrical tape or anything opaque that will stay there and cover about half of the sensors plastic cover behind the removable eyecup you can reduce the actuation point to where you can just about use it waistlevel viewfinder style  the exact placement is very sensitive though submillimeter stuff so it takes a while to get right    the fact that theres no possible shortcut to manually change finder modes is one of those typical incomprehensible sony omissions that are super annoying but dont get covered in any reviews    i sold my a7ii to go back to fuji no regrets literally the only thing i miss is using old rangefinder lenses without a crop factor
  yep im gonna try that eye sensor trick as soon as the special sensorblocking tape i ordered gets here theres some special tape that only blocks a portion of light transmission that supposedly works better than blocking it entirely     also the sonys menus are a confusing morass without even a custom menu like canon has to save settings you change frequently
  shoo shoo sonygger
  you mean apart from the 35mm 28 that samyang copied off sony zeiss    and samyang have released a 24mm pancake too    and those 2 canon pancakes work like native lenses with an mc11    and they have all the native voigtlander tiny lenses    and is the only system to offer af on leicas tiny lenses too    sorry are you really saying that because they dont have a sony badge on theyre not worthy lenses pretty weird      the only thing i miss is being able to use lenses as intended    the only problems i could mention is that the camera needs setting up and it doesnt have one niche setting that i never shut up about    honestly my evf detector works fine i need to squeeze the screen against my belly once its flipped out to force it to switch impossible to compose a photo like that
  fuck off sony shill
have to scroll back up to the top of the thread to see if i havent accidentally stumbled across a sony thread
  sony i said sony doesnt make a full frame pancake i even put it in little stars to make it clear that i was specifically referring to sony i said sony in my original post someone responded pointing out the samyang and i clarified that i specifically meant sony and here you are popping up with the samyang pancake like its a new contribution to the thread sony sony     those two canon pancakes  when you add in an mc11 by definition you arent saving size by dropping the mirror box     are you really saying that because they dont have a sony badge on theyre not worthy lenses pretty weird  nope just saying that because they dont have a sony badge on that sony doesnt make them it was more a commentary on sonys priorities for the system

  buy an a7 range camera instead  stop right there its no wonder why the nikon d700 or even the canon 5d mark i are more expensive than the a7 in the gray market people with a brain avoid that camera
  fuji and sony started selling their new mounts at their same time sony are now the number one selling brand fuji have failed to pick up even a 10 market share    that should tell you all you need to know
how can you guys stand that awful aperture ring  its so close to the body that i have a hard time believing people actually enjoy the ergonomics  fiddling around for those two tabs is awful  id rather just have the twin dial setup most cameras have nowadays
  honestly ive never really had an issue with it i can see how if you were wearing gloves or something it might be a pain in the ass
just picked up an x100f    should i have gotten an xe3 instead    already have a sony a7iii though
why is there a whole thread about a single model of a camera up for a month this whole thread smells like shill
  a turk perhaps
  run your finger up or down the side of the lens and push or pull from the sides of one flange instead of trying to put your fingertips on both and twisting its much easier
  why the xe3 if you already have the sony with the x100f you have a great camera that you can bring anywhere      because i bump it up sometimes and half of the thread are posts by sony shills
  just picked up the x100s yeah the ergonomics arent great but for me its a happy tradeoff for the size of the thing

whoa this is very cool thanks for sharing your star pictures it reminds me of the time spongebob fed the work from apple world to the baby clam in the early seasons of spongebob see the worm was happy to join the outside world but was cruelly fed to the clam immediately where it was swallowed gulped into the clams belly alive and attempting to escape its fate and ultimately perished being nothing more than energy for the clam imagine being the worm in that clams belly slowly wriggling and crying for help while the clam slowly digests you and happily feels full from consuming your body as the belly of the clam closes around you and tightens as you take your last breath your life nothing more than a snack later in the episode the clam produces literal tons of diapers full of fecal matter all of which probably contained the reconstituted and energyreclaimed flesh of the worm this was his legacy to be the butt of a poop joke imagine the suffering for that one joke    much like the worm this star picture was pretty cool have you considered taking astrophotography on a dedicated camera    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2015 macintoshimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage created20150831 002223color space informationuncalibratedimage width1052image height800
  of course i wanna do that but i aint no rich dude im a student who can barely afford any food i try to make due with what ive got
  i think youd probably benefit from a fast prime set to infinity for star photography hopefully one of our local astrophotography enthusiasts can give you ideas for what to use to make due with just a phone i suppose its really a matter of your budget and how youd be willing to use it id think that a small sensor phone isnt going to work as well because its inherently worse in low light youd be better off focusing more on the landscape around you in the starlight like in the last few pics
  right thanks man
  no problem been a student as well so know whats its like to crave an actual camera before getting a job and finally getting one you should continue in earnest with your phone but once you graduate and find a job and you dont have much debt then you should really consider any cheap refurbished dslr with a cheap chinese prime lens until then if thats out of your budget id just stick with your phone and practice general landscape photography at night i doubt its exists but if it does you could consider getting a flash unit that syncs to your phone so that you can illuminate more foreground in your shots
  nikon d90  youngnuo 35mm f20    should be 200250ish    sony nex3/nex5  adapter  nikon 35mm 20 ai  nikon 24mm 28  yongnuo 35mm 20  minolta 35mm 18  canon 35mm 20 fd    any of these combos should be in the same price range but wont have auto focus but will probably include the 1855 sony kit lens
  also i wouldnt recommend any of the older canon cameras in that price range because the low light performance is pretty bad
  woah thanks for the recommendations ill have too look into this i mean im really quite new and also just self learning so people being helpful is just really nice
  usually people will assume these are shitposts but once we realize its a real person looking for feedback and advice we tend to try and be more helpful
  this  i hate when people just make a thread wut camera    op atleast posted photos first
    usually when i stumble upon such pieces of work i set the picture on full screen and prepare myself some coffee sometimes even an expensive bottle of red wine and stare at the art whilst drinking my beverage it really takes a giant idiot to think that these delicacies are appreciated by a quick image hover on 4chan when in reality one has to study it as if it were in a museum who would appreciate starry night if it was on your 200 phones screen because lets be honest if youre a regular in this board youre most likely poor or on your 1080p blackfridaydeal laptop distance yourself from your own mental limitations and do something right for once    anyways when i finished my drink i had to take a moment for myself if you know what i mean this picture has led me to believe that i must obtain whatever gear you used in order to take my craft one step closer to your masterpiece what a magnificent photography you have created here anon i cannot believe that your work hasnt been published in magazines or presented in art galleries all around the world truly a thing to behold and it boggles my mind that youre not a tripfag or else i would follow your work closely even the title of this work is just i i have no words to describe what i felt    please keep us updated this board needs more professional photographers like you if only half of the idiots that browse this board would have an ounce of your creative mind this wouldnt be such a barbaric gearfagging board as it is in its current state    thanks for making my day anon and i wish to see more of your art often you should sign your photographs

i found one skull of some animal  i dont know if it is from a cow or a horse  so i started taking pictures of it  that is one of my best photograps
i realy dont know wat im doin
  the two things pair well just frame it better
how about find angles that the two share an outline/shape with and develope that because they do share some aspects of form surreal relations can make some great photographs but the difficult thing to pull off is doing it in a manner that isnt fucking obvious mainly with your scene and lighting show us something new weve all seen a skull and a violin next to each other  so start throwing shit at the wall and try find out new things about the relation here when you get to somewhere good keep fucking going or use your new knowledge to do the next thing and come back later    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwarepicasa 30imagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution150 dpivertical resolution150 dpiimage created20091015 152449color space informationuncalibratedimage width882image height1173

  just buy her an older phone
  i thought of that but id rather her not have access to other things on a cell phone
  take out the sim card
  hm might be a good idea sort of like the idea of giving her a traditional camera for some reason though i dont really have justification for it
    just get her an older/cheaper pointnshoot  she will grow up to real gear or will grow out of this hobby
olympus tough series easy choice
    this you can usually find an older point  shoot or two at thrift stores with a little patience for like 510

  anon those are actually great
im trying to decide between apsc crop and a full frame camerai know that longer lenses flatten the background and wider lenses do the opposite and create distortion     the thing is i dont know how different the same field of view will look on these cameras  say i have a 28mm full frame that gives me a fov of 65 and a apsc sensor with 18mm lens that should be 28mm fov equivalent  in theory the fov is the same but one lens is wide angle and another is super wide angle    im wondering if i want to get the look that is closer to what i see with my own eyesshould i go with ff or im going to be okay with a cropi know that with ff i probably will get some distortion anyway but i dont know if it will be much worse on a cropi also dont know whats the difference would be between backgrounds    my preferred lens for ff is 28mm but i also like 35 and 50mm  the crop is 100 cheaper but has a fixed focal length of 18mmmy chooses are ricoh gr/2 and canon 6d    can someone please explain the differences and maybe if possible post some examples
wide angle isnt always distorted it varies from lens to lens just look at sample images and judge for yourself something like a ricoh gr with a fixed wide angle lens would probably be pretty good since its designed around only that one focal length
  a 50mm lens on ff and a 333mm lens on apsc at the same distance focused on the same object will look exactly the same perspective and framing wise with the same background compression / perspective distortion as the other however at the same fnumber the ff image will show less depth of field more bokeh as it is still a longer lens at 50 vs 333 hence will have a shallower depth of field all the apsc body is doing is taking a crop of the 333mm image circle hence showing an equivalent zoom but maintaining the deeper depth of the field characteristics of a 333 lens wider lenses have deeper depth of field google dof simulator and play around
  perspective ie telephoto compression wide angle stretching and normalnormalness is a function of camera to subject distance not lens focal length so if you have a ff and crop camera and they both have lenses that give you the same field of view youre gonna have your cameras in the same place for a given shots framing and youre gonna have the same perspective     so an 18mm on a crop sensor isnt super wide its just wide 28mmequivalent on crop and actual 28mm on ff both give you the same field of view and the same perspective
    thats nice to knowso i can get a 18mm apsc and then crop to whatever fov i want and the only difference is the depth of field  thanks a lot it kinda answered my questions
  yes thats correct with the only penalty being deeper dof which can be a benefit as well and lower resolution from cropping in
  mmcalccom is all you need
oh i know this thread is finished but i forgot to ask if canon colors is just a meme or noti need a small camera i can carry with me most of the times and shoot all kids of referenceslight ref includedif i get ricoh will its colors be that much worse compared to canon 6d      thx bookmarked
  canon colors  ive shot a lot on canon sony nikon pentax and sigma cameras and i vastly prefer the canon      but not for the colors the colors are about the same on all of them when you shoot raw and edit them except for the sigma which is a weird outlier i prefer the controls and ergonomics of canon but have never found its colors to be a particularly distinguishing characteristic
  canon has a way better used market as well thats why i switched to canon
  what if i need good colors straight out of the camera and best i can do is to tweak the colors on spot because its mostly for reference
  what if i need good colors straight out of the camera  dunno back in the previous decade i decided to try shooting raw one day discovered how it meant i never ever had to fiddle around with my goddamn white balance in camera ever again and never looked back ive never shot a jpeg in most of my cameras     so maybe i cant provide any guidance whatsoever for incamera jpeg colors
  look at samples from some fujifilm film simulation modes and see if you like them otherwise i think sony canon nikon and just about any popular brand produce some nice jpegs these days
get a fuji and the pancakeish xf18mm    smaller size means carrying the camera more and using it more    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwaregooglephotographerjeff carterimagespecific propertiesimage width1200image height800

  while im sorting the images think about whats your message and which changes make it more clear have a goal and youll know when youve reached it
if there isnt another competent person around when im not sure i save diff variants then check them again after a day or two
  stop doing what youre doing
  you just gave him what he wanted
  needs 2 suns
  how do you guy decide when enough is enough  when ive reached my intent or i would be happy if this level of editing was in the work in my portfolio    if you dont have an intent when youre editing then youll just change shit for no reason and end up with different results every time your shot being a good example therere plenty of things you couldve done better in camera and in editing that you havent even worried about because you were spending all that time fucking with the colours and shadows and you fucked even those up
  at work when i hit deadline  at home when i get tired of messing around      then check them again after a day or two  this is good advice you should step away from a project for a while to clear your mind its amazing how you see your work differently after removing yourself form editing for a bit

  whats the best tool for monitor calibration  the spyder 5 seems to be quite popular although the software shall not be the best read the suggestion to jsut get the cheapest option and use the free software displaycal any experience    can you recommend another one xrite colormunki is supposed to be good but hella expensive
  warmmoist breath  fun fact condensation adheres to the grease on a lens not the glass if you breath on a clean lens the condensation should clear almost instantly i gently blow on a lens to test it    risking any of the microfibre cloths or glass cleaner fluid  as long as you dont go wild with the fluid and keep the cloth clean they save a lot of time microfibre is magic for cleaning glass but can trap grit cotton tends to smear the gease about i only use fliud on used lenses or after an accident     people worry too much about about lenses the glass if the wind slaps a dead wet leaf on your front element give it a quick clean with your t shirt and carry on shooting the auto focus and stabilization is far more delicate than the coatings on the glass    tldr only clean lenses when you need to
    just get kimwipes and distilled water for larger particles an airblower with two filters to not blast dust with high speed onto your lens  if you have cheap lenses and dont care about them go ahead fuck up the coatings      just learned that there are different models by xrite spyder 5 equivalent would be the colormunki display / i1display pro the xrite is overall more recommended and liked by people comparing both because it has more functions and better software so i think i just go with the colormunki display for 125
    bought a little airbellow/bladder blower microfibre towlette and chloromethylisothiazolwhateverinol cleaning fluid  guy at the shop really looked at me funny because i was translating terms over literally word for word seemed a bit fed up i was getting the term wrong despite me describing what i wanted well enough  and small businesses wonder why amazon os so successful cheaper more convenient amd no having to deal with moody shopkeepers    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce6000camera softwaresnapseed 20maximum lens aperturef/35focal length 35mm equiv24 mmimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution350 dpivertical resolution350 dpiimage created20181114 013440exposure time15 secfnumberf/35exposure programnormal programiso speed rating100brightness53 evexposure bias0 evmetering modecenter weighted averagelight sourcedaylightflashno flash compulsoryfocal length1600 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width1058image height1584renderingcustomexposure modeautowhite balancemanualscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal
  fine microscratches  forgot to mention crud and grit will collect around the edge of a lens over time clean this area first gently q tip with fluid but dont apply any force once you are happy then proceed with the polishing some people say distilled water is best for the final clean its free if you ever boil water      go ahead fuck up the coatings  ive never seen this however i can think of a few over the counter products that would fuck up a lens
  wonder why amazon os so successful  because it offers knock off sellers a marketplace 
    i got a spyder 5 i got used for 70 and am using it with displaycal the software is great works much better than the spyder one does and is not hard to set up the only annoying thing is that each monitor takes about 40 mins to calibrate annoying as i am using 5 monitors
  all you need
  literally got that exact one very cute with the standing fins
did anybody have experience with jjc filtered blowers not for regular cleaning of course but for when you take lens apart to clean and lubricate    
  they only suck in and spread very fine dust that you cant get off and can only smear with the wet sensor cleaners
i use vsgo sensor cleaner works like a charm
  should i cop the nikon 80200/28 pushpull version for 280 locally or get the zoom ring version for like 400 off ebay ive never had a pushpull lens before so not sure what to expect
  push pulls are a little harder to find tune may find them wearing a little easier due to the lateral forces involved  i mean if money is tight get the pushpull otherwise attempt to get the normal zoom ring version as always
    sike the zoom version is actually 500 with taxes and shipping  i really want the zoom ring version but thats too much of a difference and im poor as fuck
  well you have my recommendation already mentioned based on your situation  heres hoping it improves too godspeed anon    just check online reviews first on build quality because if it fucks up youre stuck 280 bucks down and needing a new lens which will also cost you which by then ends up costing more than getting the zoomring version anyway
  ah fuck i really dont think ill like the push pull thing ill just hold out for a bit and get the two ring one next year im always bitching at my wife for buying too much makeup but i just spent 200 on a scanner 80 on a camera 60 on chemicals and 100 on film shes not going to hold it against me but id still feel bad about it

  i use pic related with lens cleaner fluid made coated lenses the cloth gets washed every so often  i also uses this to clean my glasses
  alternatively you could look for an old version of the sigma 70200/28 its a bit softer at 28 though but the 80200 isntt exactly stellar beyond 120mm anyway    also good to know if you get the afs 80200 and it breaks you are shit out of luck because nikon doesnt have parts for it anymore the older screw af in pic related is still sold and can still be serviced
  that shit broke on my sony pnshoot as well its not completely dead itll just skip through menu items on a whim making controls even harder to use   regarding peaking im on lolimpus now cant compare with fujis but ive no problems youve few options to engage it if youve peaking turned on in menu youll get red/yellow/white/black dots on the screen when turning focusing ring you can toggle same effect by mapping one of the function buttons to focus peaking or you can use magnify function to evaluate it by hand that one is great for landscapes and for evaluating far objects a bit tricky to use but i think its the most accurate its not that im using them much evf is good enough that you can usually evaluate just by looking and when its not good enough youre usually in pitch dark and need to rely on af flashlights and test shots anyway
  too bad the afs version is stellar
  the cheapest sigma ive found is still around 430 with taxes and shipping so at that point i might as well get the nikon for 70 more thanks for the recommendations anon ill just wait and save up a bit more for the two ring nikon id get the afd version anyway because i need the aperture ring
  is this a good bundle im getting this ordered as a gift in a few days and am not sure whether to find a better camera and/or bundle or if its worth it i know glass matters the most but i want to know if these lenses make it worth it
   should be a working link inb4 that url contains sensitive information
lighting setup  maybe someone allready did the research what is currently the best bang for the buck source for light modifiers  many products are rebranded from others or knock offs i find it quite difficult to tell what is original and what is not and overall what is good adomaras housebrand glow apperantly also rebrands is supposed to be quite good but living in europe shipping would be way to expensive    godox phottix neewer westcott    for flashes godox is supposed to be the best system atm want to buy the xpro trigger and tt600 as a start
  pushpull  theyre ok when you get used to their quirks but regular zoom ring is always a better experience i have 3 pushpull lenses for my manual camera  the front element rotates when focusing on all of them so using the circular polarizer filter is a pain  the zoom direction is not standard 2 of them zoom in while pulling while the other zooms in by pushing  the zoom ring creeps out if you let go of it dunno if its because of age but if i tilt the camera to shoot something higher/lower than me and let go of the zoom/focus ring it starts slowly creeping due to gravity this plus the rotating front element often makes using the polarizer filter a fucking juggling nightmare
oh jesus i have torn into so many lenses and still havent broken anything
  /rocket blower gang/ reporting in    works great for cleaning computers aswell no need to buy compressed air anymore
blower  lens pen is my usual very rarely do i need to break out the solution and microfiber cloth     for sensor cleaning i resisted paying out for those special swab things but after getting qtip cotton on my sensor enough times i gave them a shot they work seeing as i only clean my sensor once a year or something these dont trigger my cheapskate inclination too much
thinking about getting a super macro lens cause ive wanted one for a while and i figure right as winter is about to start is as good a time as any since itll give me something to do around the house with my camera while im waiting for the good weather to come back    currently looking at the laowa 25mm and the mitakon zhongyi 20mm both go to 5x and are pretty reasonably priced cant find any reviews or anything directly comparing them though    any of you ever use either one thoughts/reccomendations
im putting together a new kit after taking a year off due to job for a crosscountry roadtrip im on a very limited budget so im looking at just manuals and a cheap nikon body    i was thinking nikon 20mm f4 ai leftover from last kit 35mm f28 leftover nikon 105 f28 ais and trying to find a cheap d800e i want a supertelephoto but i cant find any that wont set me back a fuckton
  or maybe i should just get a discounted k1 and a lot of cheapo manuals
just a tip that alcohol/methylated spirits doesnt work well on many types of fungus as in at all dont seem the glass uncleanable its not about the strength of the cleaning fluid but things like if its polar or nonpolar if it can break up the bonds of whatever is on there    eg methylated wouldnt budge some fungus i had no matter how hard the rubbing     windex tool the fungus straight off with little effort
  thats because there are none how had a tokina atx 400/56 japan model once for 100 but the resolving power was very poor soft as awful lens    this looks surprisingly good at 500mm  
  canon 60d like new no usage signs at all   canon 1855  yongnuo 85mm 18  a cheap but aight tripod  nd10 filter for the 1855      how much can i ask for this
  i have an xpro and v860ii its pretty great
sort of gear related    can anyone personally recommend a good pair of gloves for shooting in winter    something that will be good in case of snow and still allow me to control my camera
sigma 1020mm f/35 for 250 should i buy it    yes or no
  during that time sigma was really quite bad get the equivalent from your camera manufacturer
  all of it for 15 below the complete price of just the canon body  kit lens when you bought it new    people will think its pricey for second hand but you say they get all this other good stuff thrown in
  get a pair of those smartphone touchscreen gloves   the pair i have works well enough and is surprisingly grippy even to the point i dont use the shoulder strap any more
is buying a canon 6d new with a used 24  105 f4 l for around 1500 a good upgrade from an 7 year old aps c  or should i not bother  i cant afford anything more expensive but i need good low light performance and sharpness because i have sick ass travel trips coming up in the future and i need to have the best pics for memories
    its not that great of a price for it but its really not that bad of a lens either i actually have the 456 model but i imagine this should have similar quality
i miss pentax in the op i could read about pentax now i feel my camera is a bit irrelevant
  pentaxs fate is tied to the dslr    if they had done like fujifilm and bet on mirrorless apsc/medium format they might have been alive today
    i owned this one before and its too big its also limited by how big its nozzle is its not very good at concentrating the air    the one i use now is from adoramas cleaning kit they usually bundle it with their most popular lenses during sales and the blose is pretty decent it can fit into the pocket together with the other cleaning stuff and the whole pocket takes up the same space as that giant blower
  i also went the route that smaller is better
how is f/4 for astro in a near zero light pollution zone i have the opportunity to cop either the sigma art 1224 f/4 for 850 or the tamron 1530 f/28 for 650 or the laowa 12mm f/28 for 930 the sigma seems to be on the biggest discount and the zoom range and extra width would be really nice compared to the other two but my body only goes to iso6400   ive never shot astro before but im going to whats essentially a desert about 250 kms from the closest city next week and i definitely want to try it out the light pollution map says the area is class 1 basically the least amount of lp youll ever get
  just to clarify id save almost 400 on the sigma and almost 200 on the tamron while the laowa is unfortunately at full price
  the tamron will be the overall most useful lens of those three   just by sheer versatility of the zoom range
    have you ever taken night photos in general  while i wont deny that the stars move considerably in relation to their starting point during a 15/30/bulb second exposure i typically wouldnt jump for whacking on the highest possible iso i tend to slowcook instead  that being said the widest possible aperture smallest fnumber with good infinity focus will give you the widest possible field of view and let in the most light considering its a 3mm difference in range for nearly 180 for an f/28 as  mentioned the tamron would be a good bet    spend the difference on a _very_ good tripod and perhaps an antifog lens coating  also a 5l thermos gloves and blanket rug up anon its cold in the desert especially at this time of year
  180 comparison
    yes i love taking night shots i just never had the opportunity to do astro according to some guide i read a long time ago the longest exposure you can get away with is around 500/your focal length im just not sure if 35 sec at f/4 will give me enough illumination with the iso6400 ceiling of course if i can use a lower iso setting i will  3mm difference  to be fair though thats a 25 difference the same as between 80mm and 100mm also i have a 28105 f/3545 12 lens which i love and use all the time so i probably wouldnt lose too much by not having that focal length between 24 and 28  to be honest with you im really inclined to get the sigma because of the 12mm meme and the huge discount its on but i know the tamron is a more sensible purchase and im probably not good enough of a photographer to make full use of 12mm so im sort of trying to talk myself out of it   good tripod  uh oh i didnt even think of this im guessing a q666c chink tripod wouldnt be able to handle the weight with any sort of wind around i got that tripod based on a /p/ recommendation and its been great for the price but its definitely not built like a tank what tripod should i get for 200 for astro with a heavy lens  also im on the other side of the globe and its not going to drop below 10c but i appreciate the concern because im definitely the type of person to forget adequate clothing
    also this just in i just successfully bargained the sigma down to 800 with my jewish skills
  grab it then wont find a better price for a while    im using an inherited sony vct670rm tripod designed for video cameras but repurposed for regular photography since its a damn tank however its a little bulky and not something you can shove in a pocket aint a personal recommendation since i have no comparison but its what i have so i make do    depending on the size and weight of the lens a ringmount might also be prudent to prevent sagging and strain on the camera body due to the different center of balance    test things out in the store if you can no point spending on gear you wont need but not having the correct gear will make for poorer results    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makepanasoniccamera modeldmcgh3camera softwarever11maximum lens aperturef/28sensing methodonechip color areafocal length 35mm equiv148 mmimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution180 dpivertical resolution180 dpiimage created20131205 151216exposure time1/200 secfnumberf/28exposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating200exposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length6800 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width4608image height2592renderingnormalexposure modeautoscene capture typestandardgain controllow gain upsaturationnormalsharpnessnormalimage qualityfinewhite balanceautofocus modeunknownspot modeunknownimage stabilizermode 1macro modenormalshooting modeaperture priorityaudionoflash bias000 evcolor effectoffcontrastunknownnoise reductionstandard
  nice    as a man with limited funds i decided to buy this one 
  thanks anon i might check this out  i ended up knocking down another 40 from the price so i copped it for 760 i tried it out in a mall 12mm is fucking crazy and the lens is legit mint condition as the seller said    good find anon dont let anyone tell you that apsc is bad if you use your gear right no one will be able to tell how you got there by looking at the jpegs
poorfag apsc shooter here  redpill me like they did in the matrix on the tamron 2470mm f28 vc  the glass looks sharp as shit from center to corner and while not as sharp the vc apparently owns the nikon canon and sigma counterparts  tell me about it
  assuming first gen its sharp fast and extremely comparable to every other 2470 28 for almost half the price not much more needs to be said
whats the deal with the tamron 2875s availability its retarded that they are stalling with having it in stock before black friday
  higher demand than production is capable of etc    call around to different shop and ask if they have some in stock
  nah bulky and less sharp than the big brands af is ok for sport but the stab is awesome also first gen sucks the battery even with camera off  poorfag  the 2875mm has somewhat the same lens but is way lighter and cheaper would recommend over it
  i kind of need to buy it before the end of december so i am getting slightly worried i want to take advantage of some import benefits i have right now

  2875 has very soft corners and no vc which is important if youre shooting 1/4 second handheld  the soft corners might not matter that much on apsc though
  seeing a few of then on amazon now actually ill still try to hold out till friday or monday to see if the price drops im not counting on that though
  you cannot use ttl the a options will use a thyristor on the front to set the flash automatically read the manual here     the flash sync speed for the a6000 is probably something like 1/160 any shutter speed above that and you will get the same curtain artifacts
  youre not going to see price drop on a high demand product which manufacturing can barely keep up with

my son wants to start a youtube channel after we talked for a bit about doing something different and new so we decided to focus on tourism in our local area but in a bit of a different way to try and stand out     he needs a camera recommendation that is as cheap as possible but shoots at least 60 fps in 1080 has hand controls for zoom and as good of a built in mic as possible i think im talking about consumer camcorders i do not know a ton about cameras i have an open mind about recommendations    he already has a gopro5 but the audio hasnt been good enough during our tests and quite frankly the footage is very gopro he is developing his creativity and id like a camera that can help him achieve a more professional eye while still being cheap and easy to learn     this is also the start of something if he is successful we can always upgrade our equipment later like a drone or something but not now     ideas

  godox is all the hype atm  budget version would be the tt600 costs around 60 bucks is manual only has hss 24ghz transmitter built in gn at 1/1 200mm is 60 runs off aa batteries      as trigger you could use the older and cheaper x1t 40    or the newer with a more comfortable to use interface xpro 70      if you need ttl it gets pricier    adorama have them under their housebrand flashpoint
  thanks

  forgot to mention i dont know your camera but it appears to have a popup flash so you may could trigger the flash by using it as an optical slave and shooting a trigger flash    personally i wasnt a huge fan of this method before but it would be cheaper if budget matters a lot
    after searching some more ive bought yongnuo yn565ex for 85  i gave up on a trigger so ill control it with my popup flash like you suggested but in exchange i have ttl  thanks again

a7r iii is on special for 3k aud right now pretty good price    but idk just how much better is it than pretty much everything else especially at that price point    desu i mainly want video which is why i was considering the pocket cinema 4k about 1800 but thats an insane price for the a7r    input
  i mainly want video  the cheaper a7iii is actually better for that  riii is 5k capture  resampled 4k  7iii is 6k  4k    the pocket cine has the better video codec but the 7iii has the better lenses in my opinion cant really go wrong with either
  whoa no kidding whats the point of the riii then if the 7iii captures better i wish it could shoot 4k raw 60 then it would be a no brainer
  whats the point of the riii  for people who needs 42mp images    42 is significantly bigger than 24
  its weird that it has a larger sensor yet shoots in lower quality video
  the sensor is not larger than a7iii its just divided into smaller pixels
how much better is the autofocus of the fe 50 18 compared to adapted lenses sigma mc11 techart pro on current firmware a7m2  the autofocus seems to be quite noisy and slow sometimes hunts
  all those options you listed are slow the techart pro option is the slowest though    if you need el cheapo lenses go for the samyang af lenses
  how much better is the autofocus of the fe 50 18 compared to adapted lenses sigma mc11 techart pro on current firmware a7m2  it is worse the sony fe 50/18 is legitimately so bad that my canon ef 50/18stm on a sigma mc11 has faster more reliable autofocus
  not on the 7ii
  yes on the a7ii thats the exact combination i own     the fe 50/18 autofocuses like its doing contrastdetect the mc11  ef 50/18stm focuses like its actually using the phase detect system everything sony lens mc11 and a7 ii are all running the latest firmware
  mc11 doesnt do continuous af on the 7ii
  i will if its still up when i come back also the tripod is just called q666c its made of carbon fibre and its one of those ones with adjustable angle legs and an invertable middle part its sold under many different brand names on aliexpress and ebay just look for the cheapest one also make sure the description actually says the leg material is carbon fibre because they try to scam you by putting it in the headline but then selling you the inferior aluminium version claiming q666c carbon fibre tripod is just the product name for their alu tripod
    oh and dont pay more than 70 for one i got mine for 55 youll see it for 120150 on amazon and it still has no real competition at that price range but you shouldnt pay double
  this
  update your firmware
  did you update the firmware original 50/18s were pretty awful
    the lens is currently on sale for 160 euros worth that low price the samyang 50 14 is 460 i have no fast lens yet just started to built my sony kit
  fast can refer to the large aperture that affords you fast shutter speed    but if you meant the speed of af i heard the samyang 35 has slightly faster af than the samyang 50 not sure though
  i meant the aperture but thanks from samyang im eyeing the 24mm 28 pancake currently for 230 thats a complete diferent focal length though  would use the 50mm as portrait lens until i can afford eg the 85mm 18 for portraits i guess a super fast af isnt really required im used to dslrs
    my autofocus system loses its grip on the ring sometimes and i can hear it squeaking it takes a few moments for it to hook back in and start focusing again is there an easy fix super irritating when im about to take a good shot and its not focusing

  literally why fujifilm is the future they are doing everything right while pentax is doing everything wrong
  get the lens serviced at a local shop see if you can haggle the servicing price down a little
  ive not sold my x100 yet so i may change my mind   basically ive never had a zoom lens and i want to see what it does to my photography   i cant see many other advantages of slrs over mirrorless desu
i have a budget of 1400 grey market d810 or a certified nikon refurbished d750 for 260 less
why does anybody buy a dslr in this day and age   it has more drawbacks and is bulkier than mirrorless surely its obsolete  genuine question from a noob who shoots film im not trying to troll or starta flame war
  i think its mostly for people who hide in the forest somewhere where they can have to dslr turned on the whole time ready for shooting the animals    but then again even that niche is slowly eroding as mirrorless has silent shooting with pdaf
  a noob  well at least you got that right
  why does anybody buy a dslr in this day and age   it has more drawbacks and is bulkier than mirrorless surely its obsolete  im someone who owns both dslrs and mirrorless cameras there are still some significant downsides to mirrorless    1 battery life my dslr can easily go a week of moderate daily shooting before the battery goes down my a7ii needs to be recharged daily  2 cost mirrorless systems are all pretty new so they dont have the wealth of cheap used legacy glass that canon nikon pentax and even amount sony have  3 some people legitimately prefer an optical viewfinder to an evf  4 ergonomics and controls this isnt really a mirrorless vs dslr point per se but rather a camera company x vs camera company y but for instance i find canons and to a slightly lesser extent nikons usability and control setups vastly better than sonys or fujis for the shooting that i primarily do

  youre not asking to be spoon fed rather you want a trailblazer someone to tell you oh no dont buy x because it broke on me 3 weeks in and customer support has been horrible    if youve done the research and still wait on a second opinion thats fine but dont complain that noones providing you info you want because well its fucking 4chan   not to mention is fucking /p/ one of the slowest boards    also people that know what they are talking about are deemed to be opinionated assholes or shills and newbs that make up the hungry dim masses who want an enlightened answer for nothing ie spoonfed are just as lowly judged    so even if you get the info you want to hear are you going to believe them do you have any reason to   if you do the research yourself then at least have the balls to go with your gut and take the plunge   im sure everyone act like theyre insightfully proving me in that sony has the worst customer support with an equally fragile guarantee on their products and had i known that beforehand id have maybe gone for nikon/canon but at the time i was only interested in the price because its a beginner mless     now im not even going to pretend to answer any of your other questions about gear since i proudly admit to being one of those newbs so apparently i dont know shit but if youve done the research and cant find a better deal on something then just go for it you aint getting any younger    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce6000camera softwaresnapseed 20maximum lens aperturef/40focal length 35mm equiv33 mmimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution350 dpivertical resolution350 dpiimage created20181124 224732exposure time1/160 secfnumberf/40exposure programnormal programiso speed rating500brightness47 evexposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length2200 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width1280image height1920renderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal

  go back to r/photography if you dont like it here we dont give a shit about you or your questions we dont owe you anything you massive baby
how important is fnumber in telephoto lenses  is f/56 good at 200mm
  it depends how high youre willing to raise your shutter speed whether youre shooting anything in motion or whether you just need a fast enough shutter speed to hold the lens steady whether it has is or not whether youre using a tripod or monopod and the specific focal length longer focal lengths require a higher shutter speed to hand hold that said whilst a long lens with a slower aperture may technically be usable the better lenses tend to be faster so a 200mm f/56 may not be good in that regard
  nikon d300  well it is pretty old but a prosumer body so should do the job for that price i see no reason why not

  depends does that lens/your camera have image stabilization smaller the aperture less light you get and for a long tele you usually need to use fast shutter speed without ois 1 / mm / crop or faster when shooting without tripod    inexpensive modern consumer f56 with ois teles are actually fine not pro good but much better than vintage potato mashers good
  not just
what can i use to open my lens front element instead of a lens spanner
tfw all your camera gear is waiting for grey market transfer  im very excited lads
picked these guys up a couple weeks ago    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwaregoogleimagespecific propertiescolor space informationsrgb
    definitely not had a few copies of that lens all junk qc was terrible across the lot even the older f/456 version was better
    ive got both the 1224 art and the 1530 28 vc g1 the tamron is way better for astro the stop makes all the difference
if used off camera with the xpro trigger does the hot shoe of the flash itself matter at all    i have a sony a7ii but eg canikon versions of the flash are cheaper    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cc windowsimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpicolor space informationsrgbimage width790image height714scene capture typestandard
  the flash should fire but youll have to use manual flash settings because ttl specs vary between camera companies
  so ttl doesnt depend on the trigger alone but also the camera  the flash/speedlight in question tt600 is manual only anways
  i take that back the xpros for sony should be able to control any other godox flash so long as its using the x wireless system the godox product specifications for example say v860ii series not a specific associated manufacturer
    and just one more note on that the xpros isnt compatible with all godox flashes for example godox says the xpros is only compatible with the tt350s the sony version not the entire tt350 series
something else   i allready heard of this problem some time ago in another video that guy suggested to use a non s version of the trigger to counter it but im not sure if you would lose functionalities by doing so is the mark 2 affected by this problem as well
  and tips on cleaning the inside without having to disassemble     ive got this sucker right here and it just vacuums up dust
  take it to a shop to clean the inside of if you can afford that lens you can afford the normal service yoh dont want to fuck up your lenses with a diy job    also use a nonstatic microfibre rag in the future to clean off outer surfaces i do believe those switches on the side like to carry motes of dust inbetween the slidersurfaces into the interior
  using the right tool for job is strongly advisable if you intend to have the lens working afterwards you can order a chink spanner from aliexpress jewbay or something for pretty cheap shipping may take time because season    some alternatives   ice pick and hammer   drop it on hard surface from high building   dynamite
  yoh /p/ pls help me with this  i just bought a nikkor 50 18 there are some weird bubbles/droplets on the rear element what is that pic related    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertiesimage width2448image height3264
  wipe it off or is that inside  if the latter either disassemble and clean or take it to shop
  its on the inside what is it some kind of oil havent tested the lens yet so i dont know if it has an impact on the image
  it doesnt fucking matter what it is  what it is is in the fucking way  its on the lens and its gonna make for splodgy results like trying to see the using cum splattered eyes    it could be liquid antimatter worth more than the entore worlds gpd but it has no earthly reason to be present on the surface of the lens where you want neither a mote of dust let alone droplets clean it off
  ok anon thanks for the reply  i was curious thats all
  maybe oil from the aperture blades  i read that if you expose a lens to heat for a long time the oil melts and dirties the lens elements
from the last thread   does anyone have any input  another curiosity that would make me less of a beggar how do i determine what makes a good vintage lens what does sharpness actually mean isnt something infocus going to look sharp no matter what
  sharpness refers to how much detail is captured at the point of focus a pin hole lens gets a lot in focus but captures very little detail
  fucking new threads    i have a canon 200d 50mm lens and 1018mm lens i am beginning to make a show on youtube about living in korea and want to do some filming outside    should i get an 1855mm is stm lens for this    i also have the typical vlogger rode mic but this isnt going to be a shitty vlog its going to be about korean culture modern korea and kind of like abroad in japan except for korea
  hmm can you explain this a bit more infocus typically means that each dot of an area has the maximum certainty of corresponding to a real dot or point on the subject right
  pretty much yeah the in focus area is that with the highest micro contrast usually this is how focus peaking in mirrorless cameras works and contrast detect auto focus you could have two lenses with the exact same depth of field focussed at the exact same distance the point where mc is highest but the sharper lens would have a higher maximum level of mc and show finer details    you could think of it as being the same as the resolution of your sensor say you have a 20mp sensor you could have one lens that only resolves 8mp and another much sharper one that can outresolve the sensor and get you the full 20mp worth of detail at the sharpest point of the image
  that finally makes enough sense that i can ask productive questions what makes a lens actually sharp  i assume that in the 80s/90s/00s there were very sharp lenses but are the sharpest lenses of that time less sharp than the sharpest lenses of our time at what point is a kit lens better than the sharpest lens of x year    another question as well ive heard that most lenses are sharpest around f/8 or f/11 are the higherend older lenses sharper at lower stops are all lenses still going to be sharpest at that f811 mark
  depends on format for example large format lenses are typically sharpest around f/2232 for 4x5 and f/3245 for 8x10 for medium format the sweet spot is around f/16
  can either of those lens types be used on modern dslr/mirrorless cameras
    one thing to note is theyre only sharpest at that aperture when used on their respective format using them on a smaller format will result in a loss of sharpness at higher f/ stops due to diffraction      there are quite a few factors affecting sharpness and im not knowledgeable enough on lens design to explain it all to you the two main factors would probably be the actual lens element design and the coatings on the lens and its modern coatings that give newer lenses their big advantage over most older lenses
  yes with the correct adapters you can but you wouldnt want to the reason theyre sharpest around that focal range is due to the fact of the sensor size diffraction isnt that limiting as you increase sensor size designing lenses for film is also much easier than for digital as film doesnt need the same kind of microcontrast enhancement as digital sensors
1855mm canon lens  vs  18270mm tamron lens    its for all purpose filming use
i am looking for a flash for my canon 1d mark ii i have learned it takes ettl ii metering would this flash be good for it    
for videographywhich lens should i get for a general purpose lens     1855mm canon lens  vs  18135mm cannon lens  vs  18200mm tamron  vs  18270mm tamron lens  vs  18300mm tamron lens    it will be for a travel show we already have an 1855 and a 50 fixed lens for filming in the studio and inside but we need something for filming outside
oh my camera is a 200d
  i thought that the coatings just reduced flare/glare how else does a coating affect the light    this leads me into another curiosity how do the adapters to emount not throw off the focal length of the lens
  glare reduces contrast even without flares/ghosting/whatever you want to call it visible in the photo you can still have that loss of contrast    how do the adapters to emount not throw off the focal length of the lens  many are simply extending the lens mount forward so its at the correct distance for the lens to be able to focus properly the focal length is a physical property of the lens and cant be changed without adding additional optics behind of or in front of the lens
  what makes a lens actually sharp  the optical formula of the lens usually a higher number of elements as well as more exotic materials allow for more corrections of the various aberrations resulting in higher resolving power    i assume that in the 80s/90s/00s there were very sharp lenses but are the sharpest lenses of that time less sharp than the sharpest lenses of our time  in some cases yes in some cases no most improvement happened in zoom lenses  designing a lens formula is essentially solving a system of partial differential equations that almost never have a clean analytic solution so you solve them by numerical approximation modern computer hardware can do that more efficiently and many times companies bruteforce a design ie the computer goes through millions of runs of trial and error until a combination gives a good enough calculated mtf chart and then they refine that design  however this has been the case since the 80s and 90s so there is a noticeable jump in performance between the 60s and the 90s but not much if at all between the 90s and now  what happened though is high quality designs became cheaper to invent by using computers and cheaper to manufacture so you get high end performance at a mid tier price of yesteryear    another question as well ive heard that most lenses are sharpest around f/8 or f/11 are the higherend older lenses sharper at lower stops are all lenses still going to be sharpest at that f811 mark  all that is misleading and doesnt get to the core of whats happening  every lens has optical imperfections called aberrations when you stop the lens down diffraction limits the maximum theoretical resolution you can get diffraction is only dependent on the f/value of the lens neither the format or the focal length or anything else
should i get an 18135mm lens or a 1855 and a 55250mm lens     pls help me this is very confusing
    however when you stop down you also reduce some higher order aberrations so you get more resolution compared to wide open even though the maximum possible is lowered  essentially by stopping down you lower the resolution ceiling you can reach but also end up reaching higher thats because lenses are not perfect and never achieve their theoretical maximum at wide open there has been some exceptional lenses that did that for instance i remember a medium format zeiss one but theyre rarities and very expensive and big    so by stopping down you win some from reducing aberrations you lose some by lowering the maximum possible resolution at some point you reach an aperture from which point onwards you lose more by lowering the maximum resolution potential than you win by reducing aberrations thats the sweet spot of the lens and you say that this lens is diffraction limited at that f/stop  this sweet spot solely depends on the lens design high end lenses have this sweet spot 1 or 2 stops down from their max aperture and most primes have it within 3 stops  so theres no single recipe for every lens but for mid tier lenses its usually 3 stops down from wide open    these 2 comments   are a bit misguided about formats and and sensor size      i thought that the coatings just reduced flare/glare  dont forget internal flare the more lenstoair suraces there are within a lens the more reflections and flare  loss of light transmission lower tstop    this was a major concern in the 50s and thats why the best lenses from that area had few groups and many elements cemented together to reduce the number of glasstoair surfaces    this wasnt a concern from the 80s when most companies had perfected multicoating
  fuck that trash get a red ring and call it a day  canon ef 1740mm f/4l  ef 70200mm f/4l
  that was the wrong one the 135 i was recommended is even more reeeeeee           if the youtube channel takes off then ill look at spending even more but im not sure if people are interested in this subject like i am    i could also get a 1785 canon usm lens for 200 how much do you really use super zooms im just worried about not having it when i want it what do you use for filming out on the streets maybe like a man in front of some stores or talking to a camera about a temple and shit like that or timelape video of a street
  also that 1740 doesnt have is and i need is for this
  really cool responses thanks for the input firstly do you have a resource for your optical/industrial knowledge that you could share  secondly im sorry to reduce this back down to a me me me style of conversation but if im trying to maximize the image quality on a given sensor right now still my nex 5n especially when im indoors or shooting fast motion i want to have the fastest lens possible right  the question then becomes whether or not i can cheaply 75 get really good performance from the 90s on my mirrorless and what i should seek in order to do so when you say less elements then that would also mean using a prime lens right if i wanted to get really high quality for cheap id just buy a bunch of various primes at different focal lengths and change them out  are the zooms lenses of the 90s not as good as the modern zoom lenses _across the board_ or are there still really good examples that can be had for cheap for someone patient
  indoors or shooting fast motion i want to have the fastest lens possible right  yeah     whether or not i can cheaply 75 get really good performance from the 90s on my mirrorless and what i should seek in order to do so  you can just get a prime usually 50mm f/18 ones are plentiful and the sharpest for the price because they were the kit lens for half a century so they have all the accumulative rd poured into them  since youre shooting crop maybe a 28mm one would be more useful though to give you a more normal field of view  about cheap vintage lenses usually the 28mm 50mm and 135mm are best bang for buck     firstly do you have a resource for your optical/industrial knowledge that you could share  i have tons of shit not sure if theyre very introductory though  if youre interested in cameraindustrial optics this one is quite comprehensive      for purely camera optics zeiss has many well explained publications
    me again what about the canon ef 24105mm lens one of the mark 1 models not the new ones in my budget    whats the difference between the stm and usm i understand the red ring means it is an l lens which is better but not the real differences i have a 200d so its not a full frame sized sensor    i really do not understand these lenses very well i should have gotten a bridge camera or even just upgraded my old rx100
  for the price of just this lens/lenses whatever i go with i could get a bridge camera that can do 241200mm    why are bridge cameras bad again
  fuck yes ill try and internalize/save this information so i can stop being such a fucking leech  last question because i totally forgot about this and  reminded me if i want superzoom capabilities on my nex5n what kind of focal lengths do i need to look for
          meeee agaiiiiinnnnn    so after a lot of research ive gotten it down to the 1785mm and the 18135mm and im leaning heavily towards the 1785 85 does give a little bit of zoom and if it turns out i need more ill just get the 55200 later on    i can get one for 220 delivered      only good test footage i can find but it looks perfect for my needs to get realistic footage hope the autofocus wont be picked up by the shotgun mic but i might end up using lapel mics anyway    i thought it would be about the same size as the kit lens but its clearly a serious bit of uh kit    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific properties

im a board tourist sorry in advance    my parents are nagging me to give them an idea for christmas i have a 2010 canon rebel but its really huge and clunky and id prefer something more lowkey and casual    then i discovered mirrorlessare they up my alley any beginner recommendations i want to take pictures at social events but i dont want to be that guy at the party hauling around a dslr in peoples faces
  a mirrorless isnt that much smaller and you still have the weight of the lenses     most casuals dont know what a dslr is they think its just a big camera    you could get a good compact camera like the rx100
  i probably sound retarded right now so again forgive me    in highschool i used a camera for a film photography class that looked kind of like pic related thats sort of what im imagining herea camera somewhere between a point and shoot and your average dslr i dont like how i have to grip the dslr compared to my picture    i want the camera to still be able to go around my neck but more friendly than a dslr if that makes any sense
  mirrorless are about that size just dont get a giant lens maybe get a pancake lens like a 24mm    get a canon eoos m series if you get a red one it will look more like a normal compact camera
  fuji xt1
  the colour and shape makes it look like a compact camera
  fuji like the xt2 or xt20 would be your best bet if you want a digital camera in that style especially if you pair it with the fuji 27mm f/28 its a pretty compact little package
        i bookmarked all your recs but what do you lads think of the fuji xpro 1    its the size and shape i want with the functionality im looking for any recommendations on how much i should pick it up used looks like 300 is the running rate on ebay
  what site is this
opinions on the ifootage cobra 2 strike monopod anything similar to it i like the quick release and the separate mini tripod
  i have one its a fun camera but it feels really outdated the memefinder is cool but the evf isnt very great af is ok but not stellar focus peaking is meh i dont think anybody has ever used the video on this camera it has no option for a remote only threaded cable release it cant charge via usb  you can get it for less than 300 i paid 250ish for mine
  the only review you need  
im going to buy some additional batteries for my 200d  25 for two and a double charger from china  75 for a single spare battery from canon  fuck off lol
picking between two ebay sellers do i go with  rarely used mint condition tested and the focus is very fast and has no issues can meet in the cbd  or  used but in good condition always used with uv filter so no scratches on the lens      the top one is 1750 more but i like that hes willing to meet in person and claims to have tested it
  did you check the sellers ratings
  not him but why would you rely on the evf when half the selling point of the x pro 1/2 seems to be the ovf
  that canon battery would keep on working great for the next ten years the china batteries are going to stop holding a charge within about two months
for weeks i was so set on buying this new rx100 iii on ebay for 470 decided to look up the store yesterday and apparently the cameras they sell are defective import models i checked the item description and in a tiny field it did say it was an import model as well so screw that  i dont know how comfortable i am with buying used but that camera new is too expensive
  both old accounts with a lot of buying and only a little selling        well if that happens the charger would be worth it alone
  that canon battery would keep on working great for the next ten years the china batteries are going to stop holding a charge within about two months  thanks cannon shill

  when posting photos meant to be seen together put them in a horizontal sequence and include some borders to separate them when you tile them like this i see more the tiling than the photos it shifts from /p/ to /gd/ one thing you can do for the presentation that still is part of photographic conventions is thinking about sizing sometimes you might want a photo to be smaller or bigger than the other in this case there is no need    is this the flat landscape one its not that clear if its the anonymous portrait its waaaay too deep for me  the photos dont feel like proper landscapes they lack a sense of depth or space they are either too similar or not similar enough to work as a triptych    thanks for posting

  also thank you for posting    regarding your pic i cant comment on how successful it is at representing who you are because of course i dont know you seeing your crosspose with the lighting and spartan room decoration i would say youre a spiritual almost monastic person it clashes a bit with the large dark upper part of the image you could read it as there is no god up there so if youre a christian thats eaten by doubt congrats you nailed it  minor nitpicks the hands blend in with the dark windows whatever they are and youre slightly off being slightly off could go with the theme of losing ones faith if thats what you planned otherwise use continuous shooting if your camera has it  i like the arch passing behind your head and the natural lighting is nice
  nno need to be upset anon it was clear enough to me what the assignments are this month    aw anon you didnt have to go all out trying to save my shitty snap with a generous analysis  im personally not all that happy with the pic and i didnt put that much effort in to get it right thats what happens when you take pics while out with non/p/ people i agree with all your comments about it it is off the hands dont work well with the thingies in the window the actual picture that i am slightly more happy with is only with the window but ill make a separate thread with the pics from muh trip at some point  anyway it fit the theme so    continuing with  2 flat environment/cityscape  the river is decently flati guess    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makeolympus imaging corpcamera modelem10camera softwareadobe photoshop lightroom 61 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/35color filter array pattern800focal length 35mm equiv28 mmimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20181121 202805exposure time4 secfnumberf/71exposure programshutter priorityiso speed rating200lens aperturef/71exposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash autofocal length1400 mmcolor space informationsrgbrenderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardgain controllow gain upcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal

  fair point i was almost certain i had another one from further back but seems i didnt if i had more time around that place i probably wouldve realized this but oh well    and so finish up my round of disappointments  4 offcenter subject    if anything this 4th part made me realize how much i center my subjects no joke like 80 of time my subject is right bang in the center and i make a point of autistically making sure its perfectly centered  i dont think thats necessarily wrong it makes me feel very good when something is nicely centered and aligned everything at equal distance or at least with nice proper proportions not that i manage to get that every time or so but i do like that kind of thing    so i will keep this in mind and try to at least once in a while _not_ center everything in my frame    hopefully i can have better contributions next month thanks for bothering to make the thread op i am expecting your contributions too yknow set an example    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makeolympus imaging corpcamera modelem10camera softwareadobe photoshop lightroom 61 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/35color filter array pattern800focal length 35mm equiv84 mmimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20181122 203233exposure time1/60 secfnumberf/56exposure programshutter priorityiso speed rating200lens aperturef/56exposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash autofocal length4200 mmcolor space informationsrgbrenderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardgain controllow gain upcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal

  i wouldnt have even realized without you explicitly stating it that this was a self portrait
  this just needs a bit more contrast and those whites in the background toned down i do like it more for the kitsch factor than as a self portrait though not that ill even attempt one

flat landscape it was handheld at 1/8 i should have brought a tripod in retrospect      and ugly  its ok one of the purposes of this challenge is working with what you have and make the most of it  for your diptych its two pictures taken just a few meters apart from each other id say to either pick only one or go full hog and have three or more to really drive home the feeling of flatness and monotony having them side by side in a very long image instead of one above the other also works with flat in the second photo you have a bright patch graffiti and a colorful patch yellow sign be careful where you want to place those      cool that you managed to find something interesting even in the blandest of situations if it had to be a landscape it would be nice to have more feeling of space see a bit of the surroundings    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertiescolor space informationsrgbimage width1000image height1500

more photographers than invading migrants    why are photographers so unethical
  make a carreer   take pictures of kino photogs
  godamn those kids are like 5 and theyre still shitting their pants mid day we dont need that here in the us india might like them better
that one photographer that goes in just to post pics like these in order to screw the other photographers  fucking devilish i tell you
the presence of photographers makes gassing children okay got it
  they didnt get gassed yeah its tear gas but its to disperse the crowd of invaders and yes its totally normal did you cry the 500 times obamas border agents used tear gas on invaders
  the fascists and bootlickers will try to justify it regardless of how many photographers show up
  im a hardcore sjw and even i will justify it
  im a hardcore sjw  lol no you arent
    i personally think they should bus the 10000 illegals into sf and the neighborhoods of the politicians that are okay with this invasion if theyre okay with that then i am too
  the more gas the more i laugh
  mexican journalists finally have a big story they can cover without worrying about getting skinned alive and hung from a bridge give them a break here just let them have this one
  i dont know i think the biggest story in mexico is how they have all of these potential doctors engineers and scientists and yet fail to be a functioning country despite being neighbors to one of the most developed countries on earth i think they should focus on that story sounds pretty intersting
  
  youre next rat
  back to your containment board  
  this photo is textbook programming
  pick one cherry picked picture  look guise its the truth    why is /pol/ always so retarded
  truth its like the vietnamese girl on fire being disqualified because the photog chose a different cutout
fuck off /pol/ cancer
whats the deal with tear gas you guys are so fucking weak lol
/pol/ cancer thread
  have you seen the rekt threads on /b/ cartel does stuff that makes isis fighters queasy
  this picture is so retarded lol  first of all like four photographers isnt narly a big deal in the age of media you can expect a whole squadron of photographers to any big media event that can be foreseen    second what the fuck is the point with the rest of pictures lol why is tha shirt considered brand new and why would it matter looks like some random 1 chink shirt id imagine itd cost less in other countries also the shoes argument makes no sense again it isnt uncommon for younger kids to be shoeless and especially if she was wearing flip flops like the other kid its no stretch to think she lost them    mom has shoes because mom needs shoes more than the kids if mom cant fucking walk because her feet hurt who takes care of everyone else    plus i mean really shoes immigrants from africa can afford android smartphones now its not because theyre rich but because it improves their chances of survival if they can get one its not exactly rocket science    i guess i got trolled by /pol/ didnt i
    the entire concept of photography is about creating reality    if you are photographing under the context of capitalism you completely normalize creating reality in the context of forprofit for the 24hrs newscycle    asking why photographers are unethical is like asking why do so many people eat at mcdonalds or why does everyone seem to drive their cars only on roads    its a structure
  turn on your monitor
  they didnt get gassed yeah its tear gas  the mental gymnastics on display here
  its because their edgy /pol/ memes about gassing jews have made them think that it only refers to gas chamber executions
  that is the implication when you say they got gassed the news and people acting like this is an atrocious act are using that phrase specifically to upset retards the facts are that they were throwing rocks at agents they were illegally trying to invade a country and who the fuck knows whats happening in that image again its implied that the tear gas was shot at the kids but the real story is probably that the mom ran past it after it was launched    tell me were you upset when obamas border patrol literally gassed and pepper sprayed poor innocent immigrants 500 times over his term in office
  not him but i liked obama generally / heavily disagreed with some of his policies prism drone strikes obamacare genuinely think this country could be improved if everyone backed up from their cult of personality about elected officials and could be objective about some shit you seem to like trump but rather than saying well even obama thought this was a good idea you somehow twist something you support into a negative about someone you hate why i generally dont like trump but some of his policies have been fine no politician is 100 wrong all of the time stop treating politics like its a team sport and start thinking objectively you goddamn goober
  youre right i am doing that overall i approve of trumps protection of the border i think immigration is good when we control the people coming in to benefit the us we should be bringing in skilled workers not unskilled workers what i think liberals dont understand is that these low skilled illegals will do is drive down wages they want a 15 minimum wage but thats impossible when theyre importing modern day slaves which is what these mexican and central american immigrants are i agree with almost everything that trump has done with the exception of airstrikes on syria and with obama i wasnt a fan of many aspects of obamacare specifically the part that made it illegal to not have health insurance there were some benefits to it but overall its made it difficult for me to afford insurance i make too much to get assistance on healthcare but living in california i dont have the excess income to spend 200 a month on shitty insurance not even good insurance
my view from this situation    there will be many photographers and people holding cameras in every riot scenario its how people are these days they want to share    but taking a tripod with you is just nuts hah made me kek
  if they did what you say theyd end up getting skinned alive and hung from bridges holy fuck youre dumb
  if they did what you say theyd end up getting skinned alive and hung from bridges holy fuck youre dumb    what are you talking about i was being ironic because liberals act like these people crossing the borders are highly educated and capable individuals when they are actually just farm slave labor or are you refering to the fact that any country south of the american border cant function properly because theyre highly prone to corruption and illegal activity
  modern photojournalism is like saying wwe is a sport
  tear gas is the most gentle tool you can use in this scenario    the alternative to that is to give in to violence and let your border security get beat up by the immigrants  you know what will happen then retaliation the immigrants would be destroyed by the border security    in this case the biggest threat to that poor little is her mother breaking her arm in an attempt to acquire money from your tax dollars
    theyre importing modern day slaves  actually just farm slave labor    exactly this  at least back when the democrats had slavery they were responsible for housing feeding clothing and health care for their slaves    now they dont even do that and they can blackmail the illegals with the threat of turning them in to authorities if they threaten to run away    the best part is then they have the gall to demand that the rest of the citizen population pay for the social programs to keep their workers alive
  with the exception of airstrikes on syria  thats the least of the crimes trump did in syria    right now he has annexed 1/3 of syrian territoryyellow  green by using the kurds as his henchmen  and he made sure to put the kurds to work extracting the oil from syria    at least obama had the decency of staying out of there
  dont fool yourself both parties want the slave labor  why else do you think the republican controlled house didnt foot the bill for the wall
  because ryan isnt a real republican  his own wife holds democratic party fundraisers at his house here in janesville wi    he is most likely a closet homo and at best a real live cuck
  taking the oil was a campaign promise  thinking we are going to liberate syria for free
    its not effective newbie protog needs to lewd how to crop    but even then its not a very good picture  mommy youre hurting my arm   little one i need that money on the other side of the border  it hurtsmom let go of me it hurts   pain is only temporary i know whats best for you
  it wasnt he only said that in the context of iraq    he should have been more honest during the election about stealing the wealth from syria
  they could have overthrown him if they wanted so thats not enough excuse    republicans want slave labor too but they are more dumb than the democrats  the democrats are smarter and have more slavery expertise they wanted to establish their slave camps in mexico instead of usa hence they moved the jobs to mexico when they had power
  republicans  low iq slave employers  democrats  high iq slave employers    china has officially endorsed the democrat slave method and are moving their factories to africa
  lot of blackmail in dc  makes you wonder what ryan had on other people
  blackmail and bribery go hand in hard once a politician has accepted bribery they will be subject to potential blackmail
  those are some pretty nice anime tiddies you have there
  kinda seems like we should raise the penalties for hiring illegals and end birthright citizenship and welfare programs for non citizens
  ask 
  lmao
    the well being of immigrants is irrelevant at this point  33 of them are disease carriers    you should close the border to protect your own children 
  no shit thats why were getting resurgances of exterminated diseases like fucking polio and the people on the news have to pretend they dont understand where these third world diseases are coming from dont worry though my taxes will pay for the hundreds of thousands of dollars to keep this leach from dying then the hundreds of others will leach millions more
muh tax dollars  lol right wingers are always such little pissbabies about having to live in society
  linking to ben shapinos website
  they think they can spend their money better than the government  you think the government can spend your money better than you    thats the only difference between you idiots
  is it false    are the mexicans lying about the hondura leeches
  go sniff your own farts more le ebin centrist
  is it false  i guess well never know until you can link to a reputable source also assuming it is true it might be less of a problem if healthcare wasnt such a horribly predatory forprofit industry in your country lol
  thats why you should just let the hondurans leech from the mexican healthcare system    once the situation there gets worse they will put more resources into stopping the caravans
    either way i think everybody is morally superior when compared to you    i know your type increase the taxes for everybody else  evade taxes yourself  thats what the camwhores do and communist photographers are no different
  leeching from a healthcare system  what the fuck do you think a healthcare system is my god conservatism really is a brain disease
  a leech is someone who hasnt ever paid taxes into the system  for example this guy here  and the hondurans they never paid taxes to the mexican healthcare but they are leeching from it right now
  thats also my post and i do pay taxes which get me healthcare and other things little rightwing pissbaby
  so what exactly are you contesting that the hondurans have never paid mexican taxes
  and i do pay taxes  if i know you right you only pay the taxes you cant avoid things like sales taxes  and then you try your best to avoid the income tax while voting for policies to increase everybody elses taxes
  link to a reputable source  daily wire is a reputable source and their source is the health department of tijuana
  daily wire is a reputable source         
  in this case the conservatives were right all along the democrat media eventually admitted the caravan was mostly men of fighting age coming over to be slave workers    you shouldnt trust the party of slavery when it comes to letting in slave workers    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cs4 windowsimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage created20120707 051403color space informationuncalibratedimage width376image height369

  that is the implication when you say they got gassed the news and people acting like this is an atrocious act are using that phrase specifically to upset retards  this i mean come on now i dont even give a shit about the overhyped caravan but the term gassed is manipulative i got gassed in the navy during boot camp when we had to stand in a room with filled tear gas and recite our name/rank/division number etc it wasnt bad at all and most of us were laughing once we got out of the room running through an open field where a tiny bit tear gas wafts across your face for a fraction of a second isnt shit its not like pepper spray where it sticks to your face and lingers the effects wear off right after you leave the area at worst it would be like biting into a slightly spicy hot wing the usage of force here was completely appropriate for the context

  wow i bet the people who took these pictures probably didnt even consider whether i would like them
asked in the gear thread but ill ask here too    thinking about moving up to a super macro lens and im looking at the laowa 25mm or the mitakon zhongyi 20mm anyone here used either one or have any thoughts/recommendations
  its true macro is boring as fuck
  its fun to take them
  how did you get this fucking triggered you asked why you dont see a lot if macro on this board i explained to you why you dont see a lot of macro on this board
  theyre boring to look at
  thats fine you dont take photographs for other people to look at them

  macro is usually boring because people dont do anything cool with it theyre just enamored with the novelty of look at the detail on this bug instead of seeing the macro world as an entirely new landscape of interesting compositional and framing potential
some old some new
some macros
should have closed the aperture more to get the leaf in focus but it was also moving quite a lot
last one for now also check out this video if you didnt already    at the timestamp the guy shows of some lens contraption for bokeh
  renowned macro photographer don komarechka  using m43  delete
  why is that    i ran out of things to take photos of and stopped making threads it is getting to the point where it is actually pretty tedious to find good composition you have to get past the new world to explore mentality of seeing tiny things blown up to large scales then you can try better to get something with good composition the biggest difficulty is being able to compose with such tiny things especially when you go further than 11 magnification it is very hit or miss even with studio work you may spend a few hours taking only a few photos then processing for what feels like forever due to focus stacking and panorama    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makenikon corporationcamera modelnikon d3400camera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2017 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/10sensing methodonechip color areacolor filter array pattern850imagespecific propertiesimage width1024image height683number of bits per component8 8 8pixel compositionrgbimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20181015 183014exposure time1/200 secexposure programmanualiso speed rating100exposure bias0 evmetering modecenter weighted averagelight sourceunknownflashflash compulsory return not detectedcolor space informationuncalibratedimage width2048image height1366renderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardgain controlnonecontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormalsubject distance rangeunknown
  laowa 25mm    thats the one that does 51 right i looked up some reviews some time ago and didnt like what i saw and read but it may be user error anything past 21 starts to become pretty hard to use and people can have a hard time doing a good review if the lens is only using extension instead of optics to go from 251 to 51 then quality will just be as good as 251 with enough extension to reach 51 if the lens is made for 51 optically in the first place it should be better unfortunately it is a zoom magnification lens in this respect    i suspect the 20mm 451 lens will have better iq because it wont have zoom magnification the laowa seems to be more of a novelty    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makenikon corporationcamera modelnikon d3400camera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2017 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/10sensing methodonechip color areacolor filter array pattern762imagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20180927 173007exposure time1/25 secexposure programmanualiso speed rating200exposure bias0 evmetering modecenter weighted averagelight sourceunknownflashflash compulsory return not detectedcolor space informationuncalibratedimage width1024image height680renderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardgain controlnonecontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormalsubject distance rangeunknown
  i would defer to the laowa i have their 15mm macro and its a decent lens for the price most of the downsides do not really apply to macro i also have canon mpe65 i rarely find myself going past x2 though i shoot almost exclusively live mantises unless you are able to focus stack your subject the dof capable past x2 just isnt useful    reportedly the laowa is supposed to be similar in quality to the mpe65 with better bokeh i would get that      this one is most the successful it needs to be cleaned and then have some work done on it post for it to really shine though the sphere in the background is the interesting element the photos that fail to interact with that sphere are unsuccessful      the laowa seems to be more of a novelty  the probe yeah  but it may be user error  if you dig around it mostly seems to be user error

  also recently learned about automated macro rails from one of the reviews i pulled up that was comparing the laowa and the canon mpe    any experiences with those the cognisys one looks pretty cool but it costs more than either lens does
  this is nice
  not him but the expense on those is why ive been looking into making my own i even have lots of old printers that i can source stuff from to do it but i think ill go with making a manual one instead i have a cheap geared 4way rail im currently using but would like a screwdrive type that allows finer movements because of the gearing and razor thin dof i cant always get perfect alignment between shots so my focus stacking can end up like this even after hand editing some of it to fix autoerrors pic    with the right threading for a screwdrive i can get down to micron level precision without much expense all it needs is a threaded rod and high gear ratio for the knob im basing my design on the wemacro macro rail 250 which does 1 micron steps their gallery has photos down to 401 magnification using a nikon microscope objective    pic resized not cropped    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makenikon corporationcamera modelnikon d3400camera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2017 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/10sensing methodonechip color areacolor filter array pattern762imagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20180925 171424exposure time1/200 secexposure programmanualiso speed rating100exposure bias0 evmetering modecenter weighted averagelight sourceunknownflashflash compulsory return not detectedcolor space informationuncalibratedimage width1024image height687renderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardgain controlnonecontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormalsubject distance rangeunknown
  there is a weird stacking artifact on the left hand side vertically coming down    i hate those fuckers so frustrating
  yeah those happen almost all the time you have to edit them out by finding and editing the mask layer that corresponds to the best infocus image compound that by how much ram having 25100 images layers open at once takes up and trying to edit them the process can take hours sometimes generally the easiest way to remove those lines around the boarders is to keep them in mind when composing then cropping the image to remove them    the more difficult problems are from occlusion as the lens focuses the rail moves or the bellows moves the perspective of the lens element changes anything that blocks then reveals a portion of the subject as you take photos for focus stacking often times ends up with blurry outlines after focus stacking insects with whiskers and hairy sections are the worst times this happens the more magnified the lens is the worse this can get since the working distance is so close and thus the perspective angle changes by a wide margin between images fixing it by hand can be maddening    71 example of occlusion problems with focus stacking note the hair sections    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makenikon corporationcamera modelnikon d3400camera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2017 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/10sensing methodonechip color areacolor filter array pattern762imagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20180929 173616exposure time1/25 secexposure programmanualiso speed rating100exposure bias0 evmetering modecenter weighted averagelight sourcecool white fluorescentflashflash compulsory return not detectedcolor space informationuncalibratedimage width1024image height644renderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balancemanualscene capture typestandardgain controlnonecontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormalsubject distance rangeunknown

  handheld focus stack  how
  if you touch the subject or something it is on and the camera with the same hand then it is really easy to do even without that steadiness you can completely freehand just use a flash and proper exposure speed but the main thing is the program you use to do the focus stack like photoshop you autoalign before combining everything that can rotate and even resize images as needed the further you are off from being correctly dead center the more of the edges of the image youll need to crop off    the biggest problem is actually occlusion like this one was also handheld but there was some occlusion that really screwed it up and i didnt see fit to edit it by hand to correct it even if it could be corrected    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makenikon corporationcamera modelnikon d3400camera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2017 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/10sensing methodonechip color areacolor filter array pattern762imagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20180926 191600exposure time1/100 secexposure programmanualiso speed rating100exposure bias0 evmetering modecenter weighted averagelight sourceunknownflashflash compulsory return not detectedcolor space informationuncalibratedimage width1024image height629renderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardgain controlnonecontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormalsubject distance rangeunknown

  why not make a circular sensor  wafers are round anyway
  is this a serious question
  would work for astrophotography where you dont need rectangular image  you can always crop too  rect sensors are a waste of good wafer space
    actually think about what youre asking for for a second     replace all of those little rectangles with circles in your head do you have a bigger sensor when you do that or do you in fact have a smaller sensor do you have less wasted space on the die or more wasted space
  a full frame sensor is 36x24mm or 864mm2    so the image circle has to be at least wide enough to fill the rectangle    so we calculate the radius of the circle as  182 x 122   324  144  468  2164mm    this shows us the area of the whole image circle is 1471mm2 so by using the full frame sensor were not even close to getting the full image that the lens projects were throwing away 41 of it    if it wouldnt be for the existing ecosystem it would totally made sense    but then im thinking that wafer space in the corners may not need to be wasted  maybe there is the opportunity to use that space for some of the support circuitry for the sensor seeing as that is fabricated using the same processes as the cmos sensor
ps square sensors would make even more sense
  yeah square sensors make more sense in a mathematical world where art and aesthetics dont matter  film and sensors are usually rectangular because in the great majority of photographs look better with a rectangular aspect ratio sure you can crop in post but then you would be wasting pixels if you always take photos while planning to crop them also framing is much easier if your shotting at native aspect ratio not a problem for efv
  yep no need to worry about landscape and portrait orientation anymore
  then why not make rectangular wafers so that the wasted space is close to zero
  google cz process so you can learn how wafers are made and stop appearing like a retard
  why not make a rectangular lens instead
  if need more inside information about the cost of manufacture and such but my gut instinct is that the extra complexity of making hexagonal sensors would outweigh the cost savings of tesselating more chips per wafer vs rectangular medium format sensors     plus the only problem it actually solves is how can we get a little more resolution out of a sensor thats already 2050mp in a world where most photos are viewed at 1mp with facebook compression plus i am too lazy to turn my camera body sideways
  why not make hexagonal pixel and hexagonal sensors optimum wafer distribution optimum pixel quality my dick now hard as fuck thinking of hexagonals
  eh
  fuji did it  
why do you drive on a parkway but park in a driveway
  so instead of rectangular photographs you want extreme vignette/missing data in the corners youre either memeing or youre a hfa savant  also picture binary rendering cannot be done in square mode
  i mean you cant compile a jpeg/raw or any other picture if the output is circle
is it art or just a simple cone with a hole  to be honest it looks quite impressing when standing right in the middle
  yes
looks like youre looking out from a giant sombrero cone with a bit of the tip cut off
  the one you have with you
does this thing still do anything on modern sensors or is dynamic range good enough that it has no effect anymore
  ettr has been obscure and pointless for all but canon cameras since 2012
  i usually do the opposite so i can get faster shutter speeds plus its much easier for highlights to get blown out than it is for something in the shadows to not be recoverable
  it depends on the scene but if it allows for it i expose for the highlights and recover shadows in post  wouldnt use this method though if most of the scene would be underexposed because you still get some noise and fucked up colors eg skin tones wich you have to fix afterwards also not if you actually want to blow out some areas in your frame or the blown out areas are neglect able
  no effect  it doesnt have no effectexposing to the right will always give you more information than not    but that being said its more trouble than its worth for the vast majority of photographers in the vast majority of situations for the most part spending time worrying about a small increase in shadow detail by futzing around with your exposure will just cause you to not spend enough mental energy on things that matter more like framing and composition and timing
    these downsyndromed retards dont know what theyre talking about    yes its still useful especially if youre doing landscape photography but it does depend on the situation if its super high contrast in the scene it might not be beneficial but under most circumstances it works great
  you should be ettring it will always provide the most data and best flexibility in post not to mention its exceptionally easy to do by eye if you know your camera and with cameras that display the histogram in the evf or on live view you can use even less of your brain

i cant feel my legs
  good or bad these havent been post processed i just need feedback on my composition
canon g15 in case youre wondering
  wouldve been nice to get in a bit tighter on the dog but its not a bad picture      youll have worse results on a point and shoot than you would with a dslr/mirrorless but you should try pulling the highlights down a bit and see if you can get any detail back from the clouds in shots like this where the sky is just a flat gray blob could also do with punching up the colours a bit so the foliage doesnt look so dead also not bad overall decent composition    decent as a landscape but i dont really know how well the dog works in it maybe if you got closer/lower with the same wide angle so the dog was a bit more exaggerated in the frame      no real strong opinions on these ones they seem kinda busy with stuff that i dont find very visually interesting
are these straight jpegs or jpegs from raws      could be decent panorama without the dog he brings nothing to the shot if you wanted to do dog in this kind of wide shot youd need to bring cam really low and close to the dog impressive lens for pnshoot no problems at all at the corners at f2    bad too wide dumpster on the left some undefined green building on the right a shit ton of tarmac eliminate clutter and focus on something thats working probably mountains and town but theyre splotches here so i cant judge    this one actually works dogo is dynamic love the colours on the bushes and whites on the grass they and brown of the doggo complement eachother really well few weaknesses i think focus is missed a little could probably go with a bit higher f for easier capture and doggos straps and collar colours are fighting colour harmony that you have could play with taking them off for the shot or choosing colours that work with it    get a bit lower try to find come curves on the path again look at eliminating clutter distant bushes dont work in these situations iso800 at 1/2000 seems really high    same as other for iso too much going on you could easily cut this image and get few decent compositions could do something with topmost road on the left and path on the right most probably not from this position    no idea what im looking at here plane mountain some white posts cars
  honestly these are all pretty trash no amount of post processing could save them
  thank you i will remember this next time i was enamored with the beauty of the place at the time and it was winter at the time so every plant was dead    jpegs from raws i always shoot raw when i have the chance my g15 has the option thank god i only use it when traveling because its small enough to pull out whenever when i was shooting the doggo she was running at 250 mph and i unfortunately didnt have the time to focus accurately the plane image i captured quickly as well since its on the approach path to a major airport and the placement stood out to me thank you for your insight
  i really enjoyed all of these do you have an instagram

just started taking photography serious this week took these sunday while i was in the city  any feedback would be greatly appreciated     also how is /p/ as a board usually only go on /mu/
  what do you mean taken seriously these are composed well and in focus but a bit boring i like   the best because it seems like it has purpose
  like i dedicated the whole day to just take pictures i usually dont take it that serious maybe if i see something cool or go on vacation ill take pics    that picture was taken at ground zero so you kinda felt the sadness in the air
    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertiesimage width1367image height2048
  i used to go down to ground zero after work sometimes and take but never really ended up with anything i loved   took this guy on city island boring fucking place photography wise on a rainy day but the subway ride and bus ride was an experience i guess
  well thats good that youre getting out there and taking pictures what camera and lens the quality looks really good do you have any more with faces
  cool man hope you find some enjoyment in photography its pretty relaxing for me and its been a serious passion of mine for over a decade now     also how is /p/ as a board    horrible very little photography gets posted here its mostly just yelling about brands bait threads and lamboticket
  yeah it was pretty fun definitely going to do it again the camera was my buddys panasonic lumix gh5 the lens is lumix 12  35    not so much faces but here are some more with people still feel weird when taking a picture of someone directly but i guess it just comes with experience
shot a pole dance show a few months back
whittled it down to some of my favorite shots all kind of from the same angle because i didnt want to plop my dumb bald head in front of any of the paying customers
mostly shooting with a 70200 f/28 my arms were very tired from holding that beast up after the event
fun fact the event was being held in a church the pastor was in the audience one of the days apparently he had a good time
i had a complicated failure on day 2 that was entirely my fault and resulted in me losing about 32gb worth of photos that hurt
for next year i should probably do some upper body workouts in the months leading up to it and buy myself some spare 64gb compactflash cards
  next time to to a real stripclub
  they dont let you bring bigass dslrs to those
are any of them actually nude
  nope
this totally needs to be an olympic event
  losing about 32gb worth of photos      god damn what happened
  dear christ  see this is the nightmare id have at say a wedding shoot which is why i never do photography for stuff that other people cannot really repeat  cant just go up to the pair and say er can you like redo the ceremony sd card shit the bed lost nearly 80 of everything thus far
  sorry meant to quote 
  i combat this by  using dual card slots and shooting redundant  using smaller cards especially when shooting video  never pressing the filereview button while the camera is still writing from the buffer  never adding ratings incamera  never deleting files only formatting cards incamera  never renaming the card on my computer    the last three are especially important when shooting sony sony uses some archaic file system and creates an oncard catalog that will brick the card if the cameras software cant reconcile changes made outside the camera
whats it like to talk to them
  okay so its complicated and i failed multiple times in the process the important data points    first off this show absolutely slams my storage every year like i burn through usually about five 32gb cards per night     second the canon 5d is much faster writing to the compactflash slot than the sd slot shit happens so fast that i fill my buffer regularly and using the sd means i hit the end of the buffer and have to just stop while cool shit is happening     third i dont have enough cf cards so to deal with this i would shoot on the sd card a bit and then switch to cf when i started nuzzling up against the buffer limit     fourth i just happened to reach the point where the camera went from _9999cr2 to _0001cr2     fourth i wrote my own little script for pulling pics off of my cards putting them in the appropriate day directory and backing them up to my backup drive before clearing off the card
  so rolling the numbers around and swapping cards confused the cameras numbering system the canon lees internal track of where its file numbers are but if it sees a card with a higher number it rolls up to that plus one     so when i kept swapping cards over the 9999/0001 roll it kept going back to the high numbers and rolling over again     the canon is smart enough to deal with this gracefully though so it puts them in their own directories but my code that i wrote to copy files off of my cards is not it shoved them all into one directory so files got overwritten around 32gb worth several acts     here are the steps in the process where i could have averted this fate    1 by being a better software developer   2 by paying attention to the little voice in my head that warned me this might be an issue when i was shooting  3 by paying attention after the copy when i noticed that night 2 had a much smaller directory size than night 1 despite night 1 having fewer acts   4 by thinking to investigate that discrepancy earlier in the day     by the time i thought to look into it i didnt have enough time to run a file recovery on the cards or to go to a store and buy more cards and i needed all of my cards so i was fucked my options were save night 2 and lose the opportunity to shoot night 3 or give up on the shots i potentially lost on night 2 and shoot night 3 i went with the latter option
  duel cards have a second shooter use a bunch of smaller cards and have a 3rd person who you can hand cards off to so they can stick them into one of those ssd card reader things and can fetch gear and shit
  buy a second body assuming you have more than one lens having even a rabbel to shoot while your 5d is doing the buffer means more photos
  he doesnt keep a film camera as a spare
  not sure why a paperweight wouldve benefited me in this situation but i actually do own a bunch of film cameras if that makes you feel better
  i cant shoot day 3 because muh memory cards  cant just sack up and shoot it in film
  there are at least three problems with that idea that are super obvious given the information i presented see if you can figure them out on your own
  he doesnt keep several dozen rolls of delta 3200 in case of emergencies
  yep thats one of the reasons given that there was nowhere i could go to buy some extra compactflash cards in the available time there definitely wasnt anywhere i could go to buy a sufficient amount of delta 3200 to shoot the show    can you get the other two i thought of
  can you get the other two i thought of  guessing one of them is hurr durrr film is gey xd
  maybe it was because the photocamera was digikal
  guessing one of them is hurr durrr film is gey xd  nah films fine    maybe it was because the photocamera was digikal  nah i own a bunch of film cameras i even own an eos rt that wouldve been able to use my 70200/28 and shoot at 5fps    ill just tell you and i actually thought of another    1 even disregarding the fact that i prefer shooting in color the majority of shots were taken over iso 3200 so even delta 3200 would need an extra push its already grainy as fuck just at box speed which is technically a push already and going higher than that just makes it worse film is not hurr durrr gey xd but its not a good medium for lowlight action shooting  2 i shot 6012 photos delta 3200 costs 9 even before taking dev costs into account so that would be over 1500 for that much i could just pay someone to go buy me some more cf cards if you add in development costs i could just pay someone to go buy me some cf cards and another 5d mark iii even if you just narrow it down to the photos i didnt reject thats 1164 photos 388 worth of delta before developing even if you just narrow it down to the photos that ended up making the final cut thats 301 photos 75 worth of delta but positing a world where im a preternaturally good photographer who not only never misses a shot but who is also able to hold back on taking good shots because magically know a great shot is going to happen  3 waiting for the buffer to clear on an sd card is frustrating as hell having to swap out a roll of film every 36 frames would be absolute torture hell i actually had enough spare sd cards that i couldve just shot the whole show on unused sd cards if id been willing to go through that frustration  4 it takes a heck of a long time to go through all of the photos in lightroom after this show if you add in a step of developing and then scanning all of the shots first it would go from taking me a few weeks to taking me a few years
  easily the best photo in this set and thr cutest girl too
  that is your fault for not keeping an emergency stash you cuck
  he doesnt own multiple 70mm film backs so he could get 85 645 or 68 6x6 shots per roll
  to be fair it would be pretty badass if i showed up next year with my mamiya 645 not very practical but pretty badass
just casually hanging out and reading a book
  whats it like to talk to them  well you know what its like when you talk to a woman     no    well anyway its like that       assuming you have more than one lens having even a rabbel to shoot while your 5d is doing the buffer means more photos  ive got a 70d that i can use as a backup but it works better to just buy more cf cards compactflash is fast enough that i almost never hit the buffer limit
i went through my laptop cleaning out old photo when i saw a photo of my trip to atlanta
it sure is a panorama of some fucking overpass definitely something that needed an entire thread devoted to it
  this aint finna atlant  spot a black person far left  ah ok

its a bad snapshot of something completely uninteresting fix that to begin with      youre making a difference in every one but none of them matter its also impossible for anyone to answer your question and tell you if youre screwing up the edit because we have no fucking idea what your intent is or why youre editing it    spend your time getting better at photography and fixing your exposure and focus before you waste this much time editing a snapshot
i dont want to just say take a better picture but like do that  if you really want to know this is the best one 
  art is a form of communication i dont understand what message youre trying to communicate with this image neither do two other anons in this thread id stop spending time on this photo and move on to another

  the one you have with you
do automotive photography as a hobby/side hustle  have a lot of people come to me for photos of their cars to post on ig facebook etc  shoot my buddies volkswagen gti  he likes the photos and tells his family im a professional photographer  his parents reach out to me and ask me to shoot their family portrait for their christmas cards  i agree and his parents offer me 200  never attempted portraiture in my life  no idea how to compose color grade or pose living things    i use an a7rii with a 24105 f/4 g oss and sigma 35 14    i have a week until our scheduled shoot and have no fucking clue what im doing    what do
you should find a location first then scout
  practice with your friends/family try to get it right and look at the photos to see what you can improve/what could have done differently see what natural lighting works dont sweat it and play it cool people have lower expectations about your work than you do
  pretty sure you need at least one off camera flash and a light modifier umbrella / diffuser to make it look pro  start here  
  how many people  inside or outside  do you own lighting equipment
  life lesson dont agree to shit you cant do
copy/imitate famous photographers youtube it no you dont need fancy lighting or flashes/strobes
  never should have agreed for a high amount of money but then again when they spend 200 dollars for a claimed protog they are going to have a bias toward the results being better than they might really be
  wrong you need to push yourself if he knows his way around the camera he should be able to do it    i was once asked to do photos for a high school cheerleading team and i said i could totally do it i rented some strobes for it and the shoot went great i had to shoot like 60 girls in like 20 hours including two group photos one for the varsity team one for jv ive never done portraits in my life i do landscapes but it went amazing made like 1500 for the photos
  this offcamera flash in a big umbrella get it close and you can use white board to bounce fill
  compose color grade  these ones will be dead simple  pose  this i have no idea about guess it probably depends a lot on the people and how photogenic they are/arent
  what do  dont be a wimp thats all
  if its your first time its better to just use an umbrella and man oh man dont try anything other than putting it behind your back relatively high and put it in the center of a group you need to play it safe dont experiment with multiple lights even fill mind your flash/ambient mixture just trust me on this one anon    for posing tell everyone to be as close to each other as possible and to keep their heads forward towards the camera and come up with a few jokes to make them laugh dont say smile or cheese also make sure theyre all visible
  4 people    outside    i do not own lighting equipment
  behind your back what thats going to be horrible get it as close as possible to the subjects and have it 45 degrees offaxis to either side    putting it behind you and up you almost may as well just do bare bulb      get someone else to hold a white piece of foam core under them to fill light up on to their faces
  it wont look horrible if the umbrella is big enough  
  where do we go now
  if you need to publish more than 1000 photos you should reevaluate your photography
  i travel a lot and see many interesting things  im in flickr since 2012
  if you havent taken more than 1000 photos in the last 11 years that are worth displaying you should reevaluate your photography
what about having several flickr accounts      this
  yikes compressing the shit out of everyones images wasnt enough    anyone using flickr should immediately reevaluate their life    just use amazon photo cloud storage or google drive cloud store for unlimited picture store xddd    sure if you shoot in jpg and dont mind if your pictures are automatically resized to 2000px in width and dont mind severe compression to reduce filesize    unironically buy your own website and upload images there
one option would be to pay for the service you use so they can stay in business especially if you use it so much that you have more than a thousand pictures
  using yahoo services in 2018    yikes    
  its not that i couldnt take a high number of good photos but i like to use flickr as a mini portfolio of sorts i cant imagine any portfolio being 1000 images or more and a lot of people crying about the limit seem to upload the same subject from a slightly different angle thirty times over in a day
  flickr leaves yahoo mere days after 2019 hits in
  i like to use flickr as a mini portfolio of sorts  i use flickr as a pictureaday repository for a pictureaday project thats now entering its 12th year my point is that you shouldnt assume everyone uses it exactly the same as you do
  are you repeatedly posting this until someone tells you youre special     ok youre special
  ok youre special  thanks man thats all i wanted
  if you havent taken more than 1000 photos in the last 11 years that are worth displaying you should reevaluate your photography    kek you cant name a single artist with 1000 photos worth showing even the greats have tops 50 photos worth anything
  you only keep your top photographs  no one goes on holiday  no other once in a lifetime moments you want to keep
  yeah but those you dont need specifically flickr for which is more of a photo sharing/portfolio service just buy some cloud storage from whatever and upload them there    or you know just pay why should any service which allows you to upload 1000 photos be free
  what do you think google photos is for
  alex webb reckons he takes 4 good photos a year  i take solace from this
i could get my own website to host but im not working and im europoor from postsoviet country      they said 1tb is for free and now they narrowed it to 1000 photos  1000 photos is not even 1 of 1tb  wtf      there is 15gb limit for free account
  i stopped publishing shit years ago and my flickr has sat abandoned since then nothing of value lost i only post photos on twitter and sometimes here
last time i paid for my domain/hosting/dns i paid for the maximum period available a decade it cost about 500 150gb space unlimited bandwidth they have automated throttling and so forth for controlling what all the hosted sites can do as fasr as impairing each others performance goes so i can do almost anythting i want as far as coding it myself or being a lazy goyim and just wordpress theming it  shitloads better than that bullshit flickr did when i last bothered to upload to it with allowing a certain nummber of photos before it started hiding them from you and holding them ransom till you paid for lolpro account flickr is garbage spergy litists and circlejerking anyway just like all photo sites diy just feels better  i dont play the followers game and frankkly i dgaf who looks at the photos or not but if i did i see no reason why itd be any different to some massgroupie botfollower site  listing my local mirror which is a few weeks out of date shows 78gib in 100133files  tldr fuck flickr    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makericoh imaging company ltdcamera modelpentax k3camera softwaredarktable 207photographerandrew wade eglington ohhiinfosensing methodonechip color areafocal length 35mm equiv165 mmimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandimage created20180922 163746exposure time1/400 secfnumberf/56exposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating2500exposure bias0 evmetering modepatternflashno flashfocal length11000 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width479image height720renderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrasthardsaturationlowsharpnesshardsubject distance rangedistant view
  havent checked this in a long time but its still plugging along by the looks of it compared to the 150 exposures/period facebook says my fb shill page gets id say people have a preference for direct sauce
  i backup my photographs onto a website in jpeg format with compression and quality degradation
  if you need to publish photos you should reevaluate your photography
  do you made any money from your blog
  they said 1tb is for free and now they narrowed it to 1000 photos  1000 photos is not even 1 of 1tb  wtf    1tb for free was unrealistic to begin with pay up
  01 of free users was using whole 1tb i think
  only boomers use flickr   boomers jew boss give them shekels at the end of every month   they can pay the company easily     /thread
  grandpa please
  suck my dick son
  cartierbresson says that everyones first 1000 photos are trash
will i be notified before my photos get erased i want to download them in advance
bump
can yall stop being autists and start telling me some good alternatives
  alternative what wtf do you want  online archive google drive onedrive your own website whatever
  i want to share too  t another anon
    he wants a free online gallery with unlimited uploads     google photos is the best answer though it lacks the social aspect of flickr
so does no one on /p/ use 500px anymore i know its mostly a repository for hdr addicts but the overall quality is still probably better than flickr right
  what is the storage limit there on free accounts looking on the site it only lists unlimited uploads on the paid tiers of membership
  this is the most incel thing ive read on /p/ all week      anyone using flickr should immediately reevaluate their life  its one of the few platforms which doesnt sell you for advertising revenue one of the few platforms which has a predominantly photographer audience one of the few platforms not entirely driven by social media algorythms etc    sure if you shoot in jpg and dont mind if your pictures are automatically resized to 2000px in width and dont mind severe compression to reduce filesize  unironically buy your own website and upload images there  or use a service which doesnt resize specifically the one you mentioned accepts raws of any resolution and therere several others    shitpost better      very much this the services they offer for professionals are parallel to none and what theyre charging is ridiculously cheap    personally id never pay a subscription to host my images particularly outside of paid work but i dont deny many people do want that option      this is what instagram specialises in it has way more traffic particularly passive business and client traffic than flickr the exception is when you want to offer a portfolio of highres shots for stuff like product or stock photography but by then you should already have a paid service and/or your own webhost      my point is that you shouldnt assume everyone uses it exactly the same as you do  everyone in this thread seems to be ignoring that flickr was fantastic because of how open it was to all types of photographers unfortunately that freedom facilitated spam and storageaccounts which this addresses albeit at the cost of some of the nonpaid uses of flickr      kek you cant name a single artist with 1000 photos worth showing even the greats have tops 50 photos worth anything  only professional photographers with nothing but their personal work should use flickr  youre an idiot
    look at the damage control on this guy
  i dont use flickr i have nothing to control for ive just dealt with enough people and businesses who do to know most of the people in this thread are full of shit    flickr have made some pretty stupid choices and will slowly die for other reasons but none of the criticism in this thread has any basis in reality
    flickrs been slowly dying for at least 6 years in fact the free terabyte of photo storage was a late term solution they introduced to keep them from dying and it didnt help    you autistically responding to every post you disagreed with in this thread doesnt make you some smarmy seenitall veteran especially if you dont have any skin in the game
  i dont even have a proble with this no ones going to look through 1000 photos on your page unless its a very specific one picture per day thing like the other anon said in that case i understand that its annoying but you can most likely create multiple accounts and just make a new one with a slightly different name every three years as different chapters or whatever on the other hand since its tied to number of pics not size people will be more willing to upload high quality shit and pajeets will hopefully be discouraged from spamming garbage hopefully
  just make a new one with a slightly different name every three years  every three years  so i can create flickr account no more often than every 3 years
      this if it matters so much to you pay the 50 a year and support a service that youve gotten so much from for years for free    also to say you need it for backing up which is fine but id hope its not your only other backup part of having photography as a hobby is also collecting external harddrives or paying for server space
  bump
1 terabyte dropping to 1000 photos    so basically straight up blackmail thanks flickr
    well you could if you wanted to like a new one for every year but if you find it annoying and dont want to have ten different name20xx accounts with 365 pics each then you can just make one every time the old one is full which is roughly every 3 years
  you just dont even a little bit know what blackmail means huh
  its legalised extortion    extortion which is not limited to the taking of property involves the verbal or written instillation of fear that something will happen to the victim if they do not comply with the extortionists will    buy more space or we will delete all of your photos senpai  but what else will i get for my money  nothing we just wont let ourselves hurt you
  i thought you liked the free market
what is it about flikr that you guys like anyway  just because its free
  the database function the broad age group the mellow photos  500pxs overall quality is better but i find their photos and their themes to be rather too stylized and over the top sometimes  to make an analogy 500px is a hollywood fantasy blockbuster flickr a lower budget comedy/drama  theres nothing to fault with the blockbusters production and story but the real life comedy just engages with me better  oh and instagram its pretty much a commercialized marketing platform so i wont touch upon it
  ok i will make another account
  i mainly use flickr when researching a lens or a camera 9/10 times theres someone on flickr who has used what im searching
  confusing crawlers with visitors  
  fuck you  i cannot afaik share my account with all albums if i want to share all my albums i need to send links to these albums separatedly  what a fucking shit
  pretty decent photo quality seems almost completely uncompressed at times  they havent requested i remove ad block/ads are very nonintrusive if viewed on a computer with no ad blocker installed  app is ad free and displays photos in high quality  overall ease of use not cluttered very easy to search things  album feature is cool  automatically resizes images and fits them into a space nicely often times creating nice collages by itself    never used 500px tried instagram for months and the sponsored content every third or so post gets tired fast flickr is the one thing that feels truly free though i havent abused the storage myself so the new policy on free accounts doesnt phase me
  flickr is a website not an app      bumping this  so what do you suggest to swich to now now that google photos failed
  bump
  flickr has an app for browsing their site on phones
  ok
so what do you suggest to swich to now now that google photos failed
  primarily photographer audience  is that who you want your images to be seen by
  holy shit youre the ohhi guy    how do you feel youre interpreted by the people in your city
  its owned by smugmug now
how much would you be willing to pay for a photo sharing website what features would you want
  instagram exists
  just realised what you were on about oops ignore that post
  can i embed photos hosted in instagram to a forum are photos in instagram zoomable can i create galleries/sets there
  just buy some extra hard drives you fucking retard
  pretty well its taken 6 years of standing in front of them every weekend to get some of the haters to stfu and now that i largely recognise the major asshats they just ignore me and i just ignore them as it should be the percentage of people who i get in front of and who actually have a problem with me are tiny one in tens of thousands im pretty good at picking who not to shoot now but you can never know for sure till you do it  so just do it fgt  more often i get paranoid normies and overseas knobheads making reports and police coming to investigate but they seem to have an interoffice photographer memo now so they seem to mostly know the drill and can remain impartial about it and know the law which typically they didnt when i started shooting in the city im still not always very good at dealing with them people with guns authority and potentially the wrong idea yknow    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makericoh imaging company ltdcamera modelpentax k3camera softwaredarktable 207photographerandrew wade eglington ohhiinfosensing methodonechip color areafocal length 35mm equiv124 mmimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandimage created20181118 190945exposure time1/320 secfnumberf/56exposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating800exposure bias03 evmetering modepatternflashno flashfocal length8300 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width480image height720renderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrastsoftsaturationnormalsharpnesssoftsubject distance rangedistant view

as someone who bought pro flickrs been fucked for many years anyway how can you have an enthusiastic community of photographers when    a 60 year old unconvincing crossdresser with a mobile phone will get more views faves and comments with one photo than 90 here will with 1000 wellshot pictures with a professional camera mostly due to sad gay fucks who cant gtfo elsewhere    most groups havent had discussions in the past 3  5 years since most of the social types left after yahoos acquisition    most groups with an unregulated daily max will see most people dump hundreds if not thousands of images into the group the second theyre established even if there isnt a limit i at least try to give others the courtesy of having a chance for exposure by posting no more than 5  10 photos in an unregulated group each day     photographers who arent in it for the passion of photography will clog the results up with 600 x 480 thumbnails of their work saved at 50 compression and a majority of the pixels molested with a translucent watermark    and ill say it even if noone else has the top 5 list is far too small for any photographers who value quality to get their work seen on any group with more than 5000 pictures    don should focus more on those cancers than invariably holocausting potentially millions of images i heard flickr used to have a real personable experience back when the fakes still ran it certainly not corporate rot like it is nowadays    pic related is up there with my all time favorite shots and it isnt even of my typical subject matter ie cars even once i get round to tagging describing and grouping it at best ill see 100  500 views in a year for this picture why because the preexisting infrastructure for promotion and exposure are not good enough google rarely displays results from flickr for which they really ought to take a page out of pinterests book and it takes months for most miners to stumble upon yours    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makeolympus imaging corpcamera modelfe210x775camera software10maximum lens aperturef/31imagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution314 dpivertical resolution314 dpiimage created20121028 170222exposure time551/1000000 secfnumberf/62exposure programnormal programiso speed rating64exposure bias0 evmetering modecenter weighted averagelight sourceunknownflashno flash autofocal length1130 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width3072image height2304renderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardgain controlnonecontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormalcompression settinghqmacro modenormal

  moonrise over insert location 2018 aa    theyre nice but not spectacular not very helpful sorry dont be discouraged and keep posting
first time i enjoy digital bw here and im not even into landscape photography
if youre on a processing jag id love to see some colour versions  also m sure youve got more shots than this how about a retrospective and repost the ones that im sure you put in a recent rpt  all ill say based on these 3 is that you need more foreground interest and/or more focus on how the foreground interacts with the background just take a formulaic approach to start with like you did with   which is nicely balanced and has just enough going on across the frame    more atmosphere is never a bad thing either      the harsh truth is the gearfaggot community outnumbers the photographer community here were talking about two completely different species and never the twain shall meet   i say this as someone who likes collecting lenses and making sets of things generally just as much as actually taking photosits definitely some kind of psychological defect and has diverted a small fortune away from healthy pursuits like actual travel and photography which i could have achieved with the first camera i bought rather than the 3rd or fourth    on that note well done op youre a better man than me thread comments be damned
  thank you for the feedback ill see about posting some colour versions when i get home     regarding the foreground i agree im going to get a wider lens thanks the 35mm as it doesnt really lend itself well to all landscapes
  my main issue with 35mm and narrower is how hard it is to get front to back focus at f824mm seems to be the minimum wide angle i can do this with on ff maybe consider a 1635im talking to myself as well here
  focus stacking is always an option ill be getting a 1424mm

when it came to photography pay richardson used to break records      lee jeans controversial lolita ad poster for springsummer 2006 has been found acceptable by the advertising standards board    shot by renowned us photographer terry richardson the advertisement  shown in locations including toorak road south yarra  featured the standard cliches of the softporn aesthetic lollipop being sucked breast halfexposed legs spread    groups including australian childhood foundation had expressed outrage about the advertisement    the clothes can hardly be seen wrote one complainant to the advertising industrys selfregulator this type of ad demeans women    but while the board acknowledged there were sexual overtones in the pose and her consumption of the lollipop it said that a degree of sexuality in advertising was not unacceptable    the board notes that the woman is over 18 is fully clothed in attire that is fashionable amongst young women for summer and that there is no nudity its determination said    the board also notes that consumption of this style of lollipop is now common amongst people over 18    lee is believed to paid richardson 41 200000 to shoot its springsummer campaign  roughly 10 times what an australian photographer would earn for the same campaign if it was paying the provocateur for controversy its investment was rewarded    the denim company described its campaign as a tongue in cheek kitschy and overexaggerated portrayal of classic denim poses

  gavin talking about terry  vincent gallo   be/7vqf2rvejkt3m26s    in that video gavin is referring to this      suddenly it had become fashionable to link liberalism with weakness and conservatism with honesty underground film iconoclast vincent gallo buffalo 66 palookaville goodfellas is now quoting nixon and reagan as if they were wordsworth and yeats fashion photographer terry richardson gucci sisley levis is showing up at conservative book launches and publicly trashing clinton
terry always did his own thing says stephen male recalling those early days i remember when the contact sheets came in for the levis shoot we did every single one would feature a photograph of the model with her top off i remember thinking how did he do that i mean it wasnt really what was required for the shoot then it became terrys thing it seems almost quaint and oldfashioned now that wed find it questionable but thats fashion for you once somebody pushes the envelope it doesnt take long for taboo images to become acceptable plus fashion needs people like terry it needs to feel it has an edge all the time terry unsurprisingly concurs hell somebodys gotta come up once in a while and say bollocks to all that mainstream glamour stuff
    john waters  i heard that terry richardson was doing the photo shoot for this piece did you see his book terryworld did you look through it and are you going to show your dick in this photo shoot    johnny knoxville  uh terry might already have some photos of that both laugh      john waters  what luck for the editors of genre well terrys is a great book he always shows his own dick it seems like hes the only photographer who judging from his book shows up nude with a hardon to take your picture thats a refreshing new twist i guess in a shoot    johnny knoxville  yeah hes got a monster cock on him for sure and his assistant keiichi will stand there with his cock out playing with it while terrys shooting            exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific properties
soon the shoots got wilder and often terrys assistants seth and keiji had to be on hand to take the actual pictures i always say i make pictures rather than take pictures explains terry    the goal is to get the best image possible and if that means that somebody standing off to the side gets a more candid shot than me then im all for it richardson laughs which doesnt always make my clients happy if im working on a job but the way i see it it really doesnt matter who is actually pressing the shutter because theyre my images its a picture that ive created i dont work off lights and angles i work off emotions a mood that i create    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makepanasoniccamera modeldmcgf1camera softwareadobe photoshop camera raw 66 macintoshphotographerterry richardsonmaximum lens aperturef/25sensing methodonechip color areafocal length 35mm equiv29 mmimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution75 dpivertical resolution75 dpiimage created20120330 153232exposure time1/30 secfnumberf/63exposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating200lens aperturef/63exposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceflashflashflash compulsoryfocal length1400 mmrenderingcustomexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardgain controllow gain upcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal

steve o   in the summer of 2004 i was in the back of a cab riding through new york city when my cell phone rang it was knoxville hey im at terry richardsons studio he told me he wants to do a bukkake shoot and were just a few cocks short you game bukkake for the uninitiated is when several dudes shoot their loads on one girl of course i was game terry richardson is a famousor perhaps infamousphotographer known for his extremely risqué sexually graphic photo shoots id met him the year before when he shot press photos for the lollapalooza tour wed hit it off pretty well when i arrived at his studio that afternoon knoxville immediately made it clear that he personally wanted no part of this photo shoot when terry explained the concept to me i understood why he wanted a photo of me pulling a girls hair while i shot a load on her face and someone else pointed a gun at her head knoxville later told me he had no idea a gun would be involved regardless the whole thing sounded fine to me the girl in question was a younglooking modeli was assured that she wasnt too youngand soon she went to work giving me a blow job
  i had her hair in my hand but having someone holding a gun to her head was really throwing me off as ive said im quick on the draw but something about a dude holding a gun was not particularly arousing we devised a solution once i reached the point of no return so to speak id call for the gun to be brought into the frame so thats how i came to be yelling gun gun gun one beautiful summer afternoon in manhattan as some dude brought a pistol to the head of a young model whose face i was about to cum on i know classy later that same night i met a gorgeous danish model named may andersen knoxville knew her somehow and brought me along to her birthday party at the gansevoort hotel he introduced us we got fucked up together and i spent that night with her in her hotel room may was only twentytwo but already a reasonably big deal in the modeling world shed been in victorias secret catalogs and two sports illustrated swimsuit issues we didnt really have a ton in common beyond the fact that we both liked to partyhardbut we ended up dating for the next six months or so looking back on it i probably wasnt ready for a serious relationship at that point in my life i mean i dont know if the fact that just a few hours earlier id been getting my cock sucked by a complete stranger while someone held a gun to her head automatically meant that my relationship with may was doomed to fail but it probably didnt help

a conversation between two worlds  by gavin mclnnes and olivier zahm    no art book would be complete without an analysis of the work by an erudite art critic since terry richardson is unique in his ability to take high art to jaded teenagers while simultaneously forcing the fashion and art elite to appreciate the dirtiest shit youve ever seen we selected critics to represent both sides of the richardson enigma  in this corner we have the irreverent and retarded gavin mclnnes of new yorks vice magazine his cultural opponent is the sophisticated parisian editor of purple magazine olivier zahm can a conversation between these two learned academics help us understand the genius that is terry richardson read and decide
i    gavin one of my favorite things about terrys photos is the imperfections i like seeing a zit on a girls ass i think everyone does it reminds me of that thomas jefferson quote there is not a truth existing which i fear or would want unknown to the whole world    olivier because terry is shooting in an instinctive immediate almost physical way he catches the smallest detail as a force as a proof that you cannot control life his pictures demonstrate how life and desire and sex are stronger than the typical visual construction the fashion industry insists on the fact that he is working for this very industry adds another crucial layer the imperfections in his photographs help take down the standard of glamour and high fashion but more than imperfections to me one of my favorite things in his photos is the perfection of the frame he is cutting the reality in a sharp definitive brilliant line extracting the moment and movement of life from its vital flux this is brilliant and unique no other photographer is sharper in this sense    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwaregoogleimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandimage width478image height640
2    gavin i never thought of the framing thing the way hell zoom in on a pair of tits so close you can see theres kind of some hairs on them i was interviewed about him for one of these corny liberal modern sex shows and they were implying that terry was a feminist because he was making ugly beautiful l had to clarify that most of these women are still total fucking knockouts  this isnt some lesbian anarchist collective theyre still the same supermodels that are on every other page of vogue only here theyre making coffee with rubber boots on or putting a tit on a watermelon ln a way thats more subversive because you never see people like this portrayed so honestly so yeah you get dennis hopper with no blemishes removed and then on top of that he has this weird close up that drives home how unusual the shot is even more lts a double whammy    olivier lets be honest terrys pictures are definitely not feminist they are as politically incorrect as pictures get he is not glamorizing womens power beauty or strength he is more portraying female beauty from a male perspective instead of trying to celebrate femininity they are focusing on the use of masculinity his own subjective view of women within fashion iconography    gavin most of the critics that hate him im picturing sexless lonely thirtysomething women with sandals say hes just fucking girls but with a camera in his hand
3    olivier i have heard women say terrys work is just an expression of the typical male obsession for sex and a celebration of the camera as an extension of his phallus but this is a very reductive definition of his work  first his pictures are a form of visual humor second he is always sharing real emotion with his model they are not objects or sexual props the photos arent even about that they are an experiment an examination of the interaction between a photographer and his models in this age of media fashion selfobsession and narcissistic paranoia he keeps pushing these dialectic structures man/woman photographer/model  phallic/nonphallic as far as he can until the difference between art and fashion becomes totally blurred  you dont know what is real and what is constructed when the critics make it a competition and become obsessed with choosing the winner the photographer or the model they make it so ideological it becomes uninteresting terrys experimentation is about subverting this dual structure and documenting an intimate relationship with the model where can he take it where can he take it today what are the limits of the game what will the viewers call fashion and what will they call art will they reject the images entirely and censor him that is the experiment    gavin its also reductive to assume its all about shock value i remember when the sex pistols were on bill grundy host of thames today a london television show of the 1970s and he accused them of swearing just to shock people they pointed out that this is the way they talk every day theres no premeditation about it they were just being honest
4    olivier that is a crucial element of this whole thing his pictures are totally honest they dont hide anything they dont pretend to be what they are not in this sense they are a political statement too its not pornographic because it reveals how the rest of photography today is pornographic by having these images in a commercial context they act as a trojan horse that transcends the original format they sneak the viewer a moment of truth    gavin when i look at art i dont give a shit about the artists lifestyle but terry is an exception to that the whole dichotomy of lowbrow and high art comes from the ups and downs of his fucked up past  half his life is wealthy snobberdom hes the son of a fashion photographer and was born in new york but moved to paris at an early age it was all celebrities and travel and art until his parents marriage exploded after his father had an affair with a 17yearold anjelica huston  the other half of his life was about being dirt poor and playing in esoteric punk bands getting addicted to drugs with no family around to care its a weird combination of homeless orphan and uptown rich kid that you rarely see in an artist is he where he is today because of luck or was it his destiny    olivier its a hard question to answer sometimes the images are light and have no purpose other than to amuse sometimes they are profound and portray love as a fissure of pain and murder he is at once a careless street kid and a misanthropic lacanien they float in the limbo of rapport and are essentially a documentation of the gap between person and portrait ls it hatred or an irrepressible jouissance i dont know    gavin i just like laughing at poo and fantasizing about fucking the hot girls its the only kind of porn i can enjoy these days    olivier but terrys pictures are never pornographic
5    olivier pornography is the way sex is commercialized by a repressive machine in an isolated ghetto of pictures on the net in magazines films etc pornography is an industry of repression a collective enterprise of profit its a visual industry which kidnaps sex as a product for frustrated men  terry is actually working against pornography because he is reintroducing desire seduction and playful sexuality in real life in real time in the studio he is photographing sex as a real interaction between him and his model he is not playing the scenario of sexual pornographic control and alienation he is part of the game we can see one arm of terry with his watch one hand sometimes his body sometimes his penis etc he refuses the stereotypical function of the porn picture by placing himself in the picture he is suppressing the illusion of domination and joining the frame it should be noted however that terry is not trying to demystify sexuality hes just lightening up the whole subject and creating a more equal rapport between photographer and model a photographer going in front of the camera is not enough just like the factory owner from the pasolini film theorem deciding to join the workers is not enough what is required is a sacrifice like in every film of pasolini a sacrifice of the artist who knows that he must sacrifice himself to the system the fashion system the pornographic system the artist must face it with no fear  pornography is not only fake stupid and dangerous it does not exist its a pure construction an illusion terrys pictures are the opposite of that they are deconstructing this faux veneer that is why its so infuriating to hear the press call his work porn chic or porn glamour    gavin yeah
  by any chance did this photo inspire the 1996 french movie la haine the black and white the facial expression the gun all look very familiar to me as someone whos seen said movie twice
  where did you get the view of 4chan  from twitter or some other normie platform

do you use a pro mist filter or something also how do you grade great pics
  this one is aesthetically pleasing to my untrained normie eye  it is pleasing i really like it something feels slightly off with the perspective though and there isnt much to it to keep you looking after you realise its just a bridge but its nice      this one gives me an indie a e s t h e t i c boner    you have a great natural eye for street shots like this did you use a preset or something to edit them all they seem to have fairly uniform tone and grain and which lens specifically  keep shooting anon
  first attempt   proof that location is one of the most important factors of photography not raw skillobviously greater skill means better possible outcome
the editing is nice and some pictures are actually very very nice good job
i genuinely like all of these pictures
  no it isnt  op just has a good eye stop being a faggot
  stop being a faggot  i wholeheartedly agree the location is only a part of the equation
  thanks and nah i dont do either but i do use presets   the presets i do use are quite hated on this board but i like their effects   they are film presents and most likely add grain and colour grading in the process     the presents can be found on reddit youll find them searching misc vsco film presets 0107      thats why i like that photo it is just a bridge but you can sit there looking at it for a good minute and thanks man i appreciate it    i do use presents but i do like to edit the images further mentioned the presents i use earlier  i use the nikon dx afs nikkor 38mm 118g      hey man you arent wrong japan is a e s t h e t i c as fuck like you could walk down any alley and take an aesthetic photo  check out kota_ro on instagram not trying to take shots at him but his pics are pretty but theres no real subject     all street photographers i follow on youtube talk about telling a story through the photo and thats what i tried to emulate            cheers    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makenikon corporationcamera modelnikon d5500camera softwareadobe photoshop lightroom classic 74 macintoshmaximum lens aperturef/17sensing methodonechip color areacolor filter array pattern824focal length 35mm equiv52 mmimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution240 dpivertical resolution240 dpiimage created20181201 115036exposure time1/640 secfnumberf/18exposure programshutter priorityiso speed rating1000lens aperturef/18exposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length3500 mmcolor space informationsrgbrenderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardgain controlhigh gain upcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormalsubject distance rangeunknown

  do you have a specific preset you like the most in that collection ive tried applying some to my photos but cant seem to get the same effect you achieve
  hey thats my girlfriend
          really like these       i went to japan several years back when i first bought a camera literally hundreds of photos of absolute shit i go back now that ive been doing this a few years and get so disappointed in myself shit like shooting at f10 and 1/8 in bright daylight everything shot in manual because thats what the pros do i need to go back
  even if they are hated they look good  nice pics i dig really man
  false i said one of the most important factors skill is more important but just having pure skill doesnt mean everything will be interesting especially if there are no interesting subjects to photograph    wasnt trying to say it to slight you they are good photos but the kota_ro guy just shows even without a subject you can make interesting photos not to say that no subject is good but compared to an area where people just dont walk on the street so no subjects even exist and the location isnt even interesting it definitely shows how location is important it also explains why japan has the most amount of photographers compared to the middleofnowhere america where there maybe be only a handful of photographerswho post work no way to tell ones that keep to themselves within a couplehours from you
    thanks guys      check out john free that guy had a huge influence on what i like in terms of style and he also helped give me confidence to take photos of strangers  my advice is to always smile and act like a dumb tourist if youre travelling and remind yourself you will never see those people again  if they notice you taking their picture just smile and compliment them learn to say very cool in their language        i havent loaded all the presets because there are so many ive only added the l  fuji presets manly use 160 160 and 400h      manual is to much to think about check out john free he talks about shooting manual while also using manual focus at the same time hes a machine haha and thanks man      i agree with you man like i feel i cant take photos like these in my city at home japan is a very busy theres a lot of different characters and streets cities like tokyo new york and london are probably the ideal locations to get multiple successful photos    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makenikon corporationcamera modelnikon d5500camera softwareadobe photoshop lightroom classic 74 macintoshmaximum lens aperturef/17sensing methodonechip color areacolor filter array pattern824focal length 35mm equiv52 mmimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution240 dpivertical resolution240 dpiimage created20181202 220840exposure time1/250 secfnumberf/28exposure programshutter priorityiso speed rating1600lens aperturef/28exposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length3500 mmcolor space informationsrgbrenderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardgain controlhigh gain upcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormalsubject distance rangeunknown

raise your iso or use a lower aperture
  i have tried that its obvious but the thing is more tricky if i do that i lose nose pads on the thing
  change your metering mode
  raise whites on light room    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makecanoncamera modelcanon eos rebel t6camera softwareadobe photoshop camera raw 105 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/25imagespecific propertiesexposure time1 secfnumberf/290exposure programmanualiso speed rating100lens aperturef/290exposure bias0 evmetering modepartialflashno flashfocal length5000 mmimage width1000image height667
  it is harder to accomplish this with a hard light source the poster closer to the source will be brighter as you can see in this picture  so use a really soft big and close light source eg a softbox  you could also try a greenscreen type technique and then insert a white background
  either it could be the light source doesnt have the enough potence but if so raise the exposure time or the iso if not so consider the metering mode    as anon said can be fixed in post process either raising the whites or the exposure
light the back ground then light the subject
put whatever you want to take a picture of on a large sheet of glass on trestles put the background far back and light it more than the glasses
this is hilarious all these replies and theyre all so wrong     lmfao
  longer exposure
  posts like this are why this board has gone to such shit
  no the boards have gone to shit because yall seem unable to open a book or learn for yourselves    every new kid that stops by does the sane shit takes a couple hundred shit photos round their town come in here asking how they can improve reject the notion of practice come back the next week begging for presets posts more photos theyre still terrible then they never come back again    i cant fucking waot for the post xmas rush of these fucking tards

  sure heres a push    read a fucking book    imagine you played the guitar and every week someone came in to your online community with a recording of their first ever guitar playing and its just them really hamfistedly half strumming out individual notes no song being played along to just plucked single notes    obviously you tell them to get a teacher buy some books learn the absolute basics and practice    what if they then come back the next week with a boss guitar effects pedal and they give the same completely non musical performance but this time with heavy metal orchestra effects and now theyre arrogantly shouting at you that their music is good    this happens literally every week on this board and no they dont need mollycoddling they need humiliating constructive bullying never did anyone any harm

  generic stream
  what makes you think its large format  the moon looks tiny
  fun fact the nasa archive is copyright free for commercial uses you are supposed to credit them though did you print them yourself
  am i the only person who think that moon looks like a computer 3d model    not saying that they had that technology in the 60s and that kubrick directed the moon landing but my 21st century eyes immediately think of polygons when looking at that photo
  its because the lighting is so flat and hard  space is very simple were not used to that
    when the fuck has a 99c store ever been that busy
  genetic stream
  that is in los angeles theyre very popular ther
  this was actually the first time i ever used an online service i printed this and two apollo 11 photos i had a shutterfly promo code only paid shipping they did a good job
  because it was shot by a wellknown photographer from /p/ alex burke who shoots lf almost exclusively
  printing a photo over 2 pages  jesus christ why do they do this completely messes up the composition and overall impression of the image absolutely repulsive shows how much he actually knows check out cartier bressons decisive moment book thats how you do a photo book
  even glorious large format blows out the moon  this has nothing to about what format it used its all about the properties of the film even 20x24 wouldve blown out the moon velvia 50 has a super shit dynamic range of 5 stops provia has 775 ektar about 12 portra 400 about 17    bw is a whole nother ballgame with zone system development and different developers everything from 1stop to 20 stops of dynamic range    w/e
  at least im not the only one its infuriating isnt it
  ahh okay
  do you have a source on that
  this is bait and you know it    a fool and his gold etc

  this the only photo i can stare without falling asleep compared to other anon posted what science behind this
  a lot going on chaos always something to look at and composition is good
  earthrise is definitely the greatest photo ever taken nothing even comes close
  counterpoint that one philippe halsman shot where they threw wet cats at salvador dali
  dont get me wrong there are some pretty amazing and beautiful photos in their own right just to me earthrise is the cumulation of an extraordinary amount of work and resources resulting in humankind achieving an absolutely incredible feat for most young people today going to space is just a thing that happens but only 50 years ago that was nothing but dreams and a seemingly impossible one that that    then when you couple the technical factors and how much it represents about human ingenuity it is also incredibly humbling it puts earth to some degree to scale and shows how much we have out there this is why i also love pale blue dot pic related carl sagans monologue on pale blue dot is incredible
  of course people launder money by jacking up the price of his photos its a commin practice in the business however gursky is good overpriced but good anish kapoor on the other hand
  the art money launder is far subtle and mostly on nonpopular art buying photo from famous photographer by 4million is noticing whole law squad

brokefag here what are some of the cheapest ways to get good artificial lighting i am particularly fond of low iso film and lighting is often an issue for me    any suggestions under 100 im willing to get creative with diy shit
go to a home improvement store and get some led work lights on stands     
literally take any bright light and just put white paper or fabric in front of it personally i find lighting equipment to be retarded compensate with shutter speed or find a way to get natural light its not hard
  if youre going to do this just do it right get something like an alienbees
  ikr upping my shutter will totally get me the spot hairlight from above behind  teamavailablelightonly
  how much lights do you need how bright continuous or flash godox and yongnuo as well as every rebrand of those have quite good and cheap speedlights continuous lights may be cheaper because you could even get standard ledbulbs color consistence could be a problem though and could fuck up your white balance  to get the lights soft or focused you could become creative in ways  allready suggested papers fabrics foils
  get simple flashgun and go for deer in headlights look
  under 100  do it right  he doesnt want to anon
chink shit is your friend aliexpress/gearbest/banggood/chink ebay sellers will give you a speedlite cheap enough to do the job its never been a better time to be a poorfag photographer imo
godox two speed lights and a controller
  literally take any bright light and just put white paper or fabric in front of it  he wants to shoot lowiso film youd have to have some seriously bright lights to shoot lowiso film with a setup like that     personally i find lighting equipment to be retarded  id bet a nickel you just dont know how to use artificial light well
  any suggestions under 100 im willing to get creative with diy shit    here you go      amazon basics flash lets you control the flash output has a builtin optical slave trigger basic if i see a bright light make my bright light go too triggering but good enough and has a bounce/swivel head get two or three of those and youre pretty much set stick one on your camera at lowest power to be your trigger and maybe some fill use the other two for your actual lighting hit the strobist blog for information on how to shoot with manual strobes
  get a flash a remote trigger and a stand pretty much any flash will work and the cheap yongnuo triggers are great    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwaresnapseed 20imagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20181124 235236color space informationsrgbimage width1200image height630
  those have the shittiest color in the world
  the color is fine i just think flashes or strobes are better than continuous lighting its hard to get that iso 100  f8  1/125s studio look with continuous lights
  no is not fine crappy leds have weird color temp and sometimes they have a blue o magenta tint    yeah a flash is the easyest thing in the world
  for optimum jewlevel but effective lighting get a power strip some outlet to bulb socket adapters and some light bulbs probably led for less power/heat per brightness with some good color temperatures you can get 300500 watts equivalent power off one power strip it itll cost you maybe 20 bucks all in less if you have some stuff laying around i think the adapters are like 150 each if you want to diffuse the light i went super ghetto with it and took a kleenex box cut it out put it around the power strip and bulbs and stapled some paper or parchment paper for less diffusion over the bulbs itll look sketchy af but produces a very decent result
flash lighting kit    stand      bracket      umbrella reflecting      umbrella shoot through      radio triggers      flash vivitar 283 or 273
  why not halogen light  though halogen bolbs are getting harder and harder to find in europe but they have a 100 cri they are warm light but what is color correction and gels for  its still possible to find those 500w projectors in the grey market for next to nothing price and should be for the next 10 to 20 years till then op should have money to invest in proper gear
  cheap diff  two words  c h i n a  b a l l  the issues are getting enough wattage out of one bulb if youre doing 3 pt and not blowing a fuse if your outlets take 1000w max
  in the usa a 15a breaker outlet will do 1800w peak and 1500w continuous
honestly for continuous lighting go to any home improvement store and buy some painters lamps and a variety of bulbs and experiment if youve got a big wall thats a light color you can even bounce some of it for interesting shadow techniques lighting can be done on the cheap i prefer natural light myself but sometimes need to add so supplemental side lighting on the fly while at a job and have gone this route before
rich fag here artificial lighting is a meme and gives your photography an expiration date
i know you claimed a lower budget but i really think its still worthwhile advice for anyone looking to get into serious lighting to check out cheap noname studio kits most camera stores that you walk into will have one lying around and bang for your buck they are fucking amazing  for about the same price as an offbrand ttl speedlight you can get 3 heads all more powerful than that speedlight stands for all of them a softbox an umbrella and a wireless trigger  that will put actual professional quality results within your reach rather than fucking around with a pile of stupid shit you got from bunnings    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpicolor space informationuncalibrated
  yes totally i love halogen and tugsten lamps    fresnels can be faound still and they have full spectrum yes  only disadvantage is the heat
  thats why you use leds each light pulls maybe 12w at max so like 100 a strip at an absolute maximum that x3 and youve got 300 watts if your outlets cant handle that id be concerned

how do i take photos like terry with just a basic dslr
  off camera flash using a bracket
  d3x  lol so much for the terry shoots crap gear meme
  he shoots all sorts of cheap cameras ive seen him use a ricoh gr and some micro four thirds panasonic i think he knows how to work his lighting
  two molesters in one pic nice
  verrry carefully

  molest  no such thing  prove me wrong  pr0tip of my dicks
kek
  roman is a true hero
    wot m8
  kek
  he knows how to work his lighting  does he  his lighting always looked extremely simple and uninteresting to me
  they both used their influence and fame to rape and molest girls that are a fraction of their age  both of them are scumbags
  terry has incredible craftmanship and talent you pleb wouldnt know but he actually does high end fashion shoots for vogue and pirelli    even his meme white background shots are out of your league to achieve such intimacy with the models is an incredible talent itself the shots are rudimentary sure but the expressions he goften gets from politicians actors models and normal people is out of this world you can see they are really enjoying the drug fueled orgies and the photoshot you wont get such intimacy even if you had access to obama cyrus and others    he also developed his own unique style and voice you see a picture like these and you instantly think about terry its hard to achieve a voice when everyone has a camera these days you will never get your voice for example    for these and other reasons terry is the ultimate pleb filter

ive got this polaroid camera same model as pic related and it is not working yet functional    ive got this polaroid camera with a confusing issue when i put in a new pack of film it will push out the cover without an issue but when i try to take pictures itll flash and then not print out the film    i was screwing around with it just a minute ago and found something strange that gives me hope for it i pressed the button to take a picture and it flashed without printing anything out as usual i took the cartridge out put it back in and the camera printed out the top picture like it would the cover to my surprise the film was developing the picture i had taken a moment before    so it seems to be taking the pictures but its just not printing them out when i press the button it seems like a small issue so how can i fix this can i fix this
  any thrift store will have 600style polaroid cameras for basically free they wont fold up quite as small but 1 for an old polaroid is probably cheaper than getting that repaired
  i need it to be in this exact model for something
ask polaroid originals they can help you for free

            these i liked a lot very nice use of color                these were ok/couldve been    the rest werent all that interesting but i could at least see what you were going for    i never realized that some people might feel inhibited to post their pics here due to some required level but i hope people continue to make photo threads  i especially like it when you can see certain tendencies in the pics people take
  i dont feel like youre lowering the bar theyre decent and most have a clear common thread quite consistent good use of color even if i dont like most which is just personal taste      i like it very different from the rest the diagonal movement and accelerating rhythm of the columns make it more dynamic plus im biased towards photos with people in them wish the bottom was cropped a bit      i fail to see the structure in this it sticks out from the rest because its organic forms rather than clean straight lines      cool odd and mysterious it points slightly upwards i wish you got a couple steps closer so the light would be a bit lower while keeping the horizon where it is it would be nice to have a series      too much space on the left      feels balanced the drainpipe could be brighter or the triangle less white      i see you placed the vertical line in the middle but the triangle it forms with the curb crack and the pole feels off plus theres the three thingies in the ceiling i dont think the white stain on the left is enough to balance it      the preceding one was enough        again too much space on the right im not sure if your intention was to trigger people with things that are precise but slightly off in which case youve succeeded and youre an evil person      theres these strong lines leading through the alleyway and a very different light i feel like its two disconnected images    for what i didnt mention i either thought was alright or couldnt give any relevant insight most of these remarks are nitpicks and autism speaking anyway i hope you find something in it otherwise its still a bump i guess
whooops odd and mysterious was about   misquoted
      thank you for taking the time to look and comment it is really appreciated you all gave me a lot to consider    as for lowering the bar i often told myself ill make a thread when i have something worth sharing this was an effort to get over that mentality and to encourage others to not think that way    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makepentaxcamera modelpentax k5camera softwaresnapseed 20imagespecific propertiesimage created20181113 192933exposure time1/60 secfnumberf/35iso speed rating2000lens aperturef/35focal length3500 mmcolor space informationuncalibratedimage width1091image height1366
  lmao being this afraid of posting in an anonymus board    shove the bar up your ass tech nerd    kys
  mate look for the thread of kurwa trip he got that covered he both lowers and raises the bar at the same time he lowers it because most of it is shit he raises it because he doesnt fucking care hes into weird shit and is gonna shoot it and post it whether people like it or not his crappy vision is unique hes completely true to himself currently the best thread and the reason why i keep coming to 4chan
     epic       sometimes your greens get a little carried away with themselves      all absolute gems the only thing that needs a bit of consideration is your processing which still seems tied to the adobe out of the box yellowing that afflicts certain brands when processed through their software also dont overthink my opinion no one else seems to be complaining
  again too much space on the right im not sure if your intention was to trigger people with things that are precise but slightly off in which case youve succeeded and youre an evil person  this imperfect framing like that really sets off my autism it feels physically uncomfortable but i like the basket picture

  oldfags  nobody give a shit about them i only give a shit about active posters like you
  did you shoot with the electronic shutter here im seeing some weird bars here
  no that was the mechanical shutter youre seeing the fluorescent lights cycle dont quote me but it is my understanding that fluorescent lights in the usa cycle at 60 hz 50 hz in eu if you shoot such lights with a shutter speed that is enough youll be able to catch the light cycling    i could be completely wrong anyone more knowledgeable please correct any misinformation    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makefujifilmcamera modelx100tcamera softwaresnapseed 20imagespecific propertiesimage created20181121 232207exposure time1/2500 secfnumberf/40iso speed rating800lens aperturef/40focal length2300 mmcolor space informationuncalibratedimage width1366image height911

  soliciting money from strangers
  go shove a lambo in your ass
  do you consider blowing your highlights and exposure to be creative choices
  look at this  chosis if you just would have chosen an a for your nick instead of an o you could have been an actual and decent photographer  does it bother you this guy actually lives the life you just pretend to have good looking in shape actually photographing chicks who even asked for it not like you stalking poor girls on streets and call it art having a sane mind actually being too modest an not like you being a phony ass and  of course  being an actual talented phitographer with potential but also having a stable life while you suffer from lunacy and delusion and cant even make one decent shot and will never develop anything because everyone tells you that you need help but you fucking cant admit it to yourself well  at least you have a lambo  oh wait  lol
  i just had a look at your website and i for one am pleasantly surprised as i did not expect 1 that your photos are that good and 2 that chasisphotoscom is actually not a rip off to make fun of chosis which i would totally support though

  is this kinda thing cringey to watch/do irl
  if you mean doing the actual cosplaying then i dunno  as for taking the pic it was only a bit odd for me the first 5 minutes because beta but you then realize everyone is just doing their thing and pretty much all the cosplayers were in character and posing for everyone  it was at a fairly big festival in osaka nipponbashi street festa and there were thousands of people on the street everyone taking pics and vids and there were the more scantly clad ladies with an entire audience taking snaps of them so it was easy to get in the element  but overall its fun desu

                wow great guys the same correlation 8 times in a row
  a series of pictures around the same theme in a segue thread manages to upset you
  the point of the thread is to post a photo that have a similarity with the last photo posted and not to repeat said similarity into the photo being posted next if youre going to post the same similarities over and over again you may as well create a dedicated thread to the subject
  post a photo of your own that corresponds to an object or motif in the picture in the post above yours    segue threads arent for bellyaching so cut that shit out
  how is the scene suppose to move without interruption to another if its moving to the same scene   this is now a boat thread

these are beautiful better than that stupid scotland thread
  i dont know if you are being sarcastic or truthful but thanks either way
which camera do you use looks pretty awesome
  im shooting on a sony a7iii with canon and nikon lenses    sonys menus suck dick tho and the over all feel of it sucks dick but it was cheaper and less gimped than the 5d4 so i bought it not sure how i feel yet
  love your pics im wondering where you were standing to shoot gyeongbokgung palace
    i like these two dont see much in the rest of them
  theres a free museum about korean contemporary history and one floor has a outdoor section with that view
  shit is expensive man do you know any alternatives     some of your photos are great
  i never looked for alternatives but its a bitch because you are stuck with thread size    i love the images it produces so i think its worth buy for your favorite lens
  thanks

free photo thread bumps
love the photos op
op are you still there im heading up on teh 13th
hi i am zeno the devourer please explain that one photo with the ridiculous huge explosion that cannot be real did you photoshop it or are we just in hell or the matrix or something thanks
  probably a long exposure of fireworks from a festival  unlike china south korea has industry standards that merit a first world country that put a preemptive stop to shit like a factory exploding because someone thinks its a good idea to put all explosive materials in one place
  ok this is epic
great thread why arent you tripping anymore
  vasoline on uv filter  or fishnets
  yet the samsung factories keep exploding lmao
  so do you just keep the filter on 24/7 or what
  when i look in the mirror i feel very unauthentic if it makes sense  after all you can deliver some great photos any blog or insta
  beautiful thread do you mind if i use this photo for a noise track i made ill change the art once im done with the album

      keep it up my man also what lens were you using in the motorcycle picture i can see that its a 50mm according to the exif data but is it a prime lens or telephoto
  hey dont feel bad these are some of the best digital photos ive ever seen how much editing did you do what programs did you use etc
  you know my dude money making isnt the endallbeall of human existence and success has many different forms ive spent a lot of money on a lot of pipe dreams a lot of money pissed away on other way stupider shit the money which i perhaps once felt i wasted in retrospect was wellspent in that the experiences the learning and the joy i derived in those moments is untouchable by any amount of money money certainly can give us a level of comfort but it does not buy happiness and you should find resplendence in what you did obtain with it perhaps the body of work you accrued is unappreciated now by the masses perhaps it will never be unfortunately the society we live in today has some strange values and obsesses over vice instead of virtue however you and you alone decide how happy you are with the experiences you had and i for one believe monetary gain is not to be the deciding factor in such things your work is great and i hope that someday i can be even a decent artist because i chose the opposite path instead of chasing my pipe dreams of being an artist i thought it was worthless and instead worked i have been working for 9 years now and wish often that i had done the opposite i have my arts but truly believe i would be much better had i spent even 1/3 of that time practicing art instead of working keep pushing godspeed and good luck anonymous
  what was your pipe dream
  fuck me didnt notice that our guy is in full kys mode thanks to some pics not getting recognition wish i could do something about it but i guess it cant be helped i could overprise his work but that wouldnt help him at all in the long run cant offer advices on what he has as well hes past the beginner mode and on a path one needs to make for himself id probably slap the shit out of him and send him packing to another field he can become an editting god second comming of cartierbresson and it would not help him business is all contacts and heavy duty shilling nowdays not much we poor anons can do for eachother

  i though about killing myself when i was there sat on the mapo bridge for a few hours didnt feel the urge to jump not sure if it was the right decision yet or not at least i got to take some snapshits while i was there    thought about moving but a teaching job is like 1/3 of what i make in the states and i never finished my degree
  you dont jump youll take some good pictures youll take some bad pictures you jump youll never do anything at all ever again so keep breathing its gonna be alright

the thing about chunking mansion roaches is they dont give a flying fuck about people they are brave if you use the stairwell when you get to the floor with all the paki and indian restraunts they are just crawling everywhere in the open which leads me to believe they are falling in soups and shit all day long china got me skeeeved    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce7m3camera softwareadobe photoshop lightroom classic 75 macintoshmaximum lens aperturef/13focal length 35mm equiv50 mmimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20181203 100634exposure time1/400 secfnumberf/13exposure programmanualiso speed rating1600lens aperturef/13brightness23 evexposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length5000 mmcolor space informationsrgbrenderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal

these are so lifeless this is what id expect from a machine that had been taught to make art  just completely derivative shots with no soul in them at all  i dont think the reddit file names are helping either
the fuck is up with your tones these all look like pseudohdr maxclarity shit

  saved this months ago still awesome    all the telephoto stuff is excellent as well                all improved my day
  nice colors and nice shot i dunno if the left post does good or harm      roof construction gates and windows at the end and the shadows on the floor arouse my interest more telephoto or portrait orientation would bring interest here i think      it does not receive my attention on the left is it too dark there still nice      on the subject of time travel d

  i like some of these i do have little niggles about the ones i do like but that is probably my autismo/cdo some snapshits at the end tho      i believe hes a polish man that lives in poland what do you expect i like threads like these seeing how photographers from around the world photograph their own environment the whole instagram thing is based around the exotic i think that kind of thing is frowned upon in poland  would a street portraiture thread from gay pride march in brazil photographed by a somalian be more your cup of tea
  lmao this is some next level /pol/ delusion literally having a bias towards snapshits that align with your ideology
  glad you had a laugh out of it i dont have an idealology i just like local things for local people visitors can take photos too and edit them the way they seem fit what is wrong with taking a boring photo if the subject is boring boring is the new interesting
      lmfao wyd
  i agree thanks for your input all of these do seem still and lifeless without any action or bald longnosed apes doing relateable things i guess thats whats called a style and mine isnt up your alley you arent forced to look at filenames btw those are solely there for my brief 5 second amusement of typing them out
  maybe because theyre mostly pseudohdr maxclarity snapshits you dont have to be here i have a hard time coping with digishit dr compared to film this is how i do
  that ex construction hall wasnt a very tripodfriendly location

saw his show in folkwang earlier this year made me happy sad that nobody on /p/ cares for photography and ghirri is hard to get into thanks for trying to share it though   
  his shots are almost obtusely low key though and i find myself comparing him unfavourably and possibly unfairly to others of his generation  still added a few to my trove
  also op is not posting his best stuff
stupid questions that need no extra thread post them here and get enlightened  last thread 
  is eating bananas with your asshole gay
  is it normal for a flash to make a somewhat bounce sound when its turned off and placed down on something  does it have a transport safety mechanism
why do prime lenses sexist when zoom lenses also exist
what are these random bright pixels in my picture 1600 something zoom ignore the spots
  also how to get rid of them
  noise hot pixels  thats all i can think of right now  how long was this exposure
  30 seconds
  but it was 100 iso btw
  canon
  nikon  more like nishit tho i wish i bought a canon or sony
nvm single pixel noise reduction in capture one seemed to get rid of it
if im taking photos of a photo how do i remove a reflection on the glass cover  i have a polarizing filter but i feel like its not going to magically solve my problem
  cold/hot spots very common on very long exposures no matter the brand nothing to worry aobut
  because with less moving components engineers can make lenses with a wider aperture also they can get more precise meaning sharper images
  more like nishit tho i wish i bought a canon or sony  youre an idiot
my mom found an old minolta film camera that i had when i was in high school in the mid2000s do modern sony lenses work on older minolta products
  no
want to get some used manual lenses from the us friend is in florida and i live in india which sites are good to order from i had seen some lenses i like on the used section of kehcom and usedphotoprocom are they good how much time will it take to deliver can we refund if its faulty
  kiiiiinda it depends on how old the film camera and how modern the sony lens     if its a manual focus film camera then its a hard no     if youre talking about lenses for their current mirrorless lineup its a hard no     but if its an autofocus film camera and youre talking about sony amount lenses which arent all technically discontinued then yes i think unless the old af bodies are incompatible with sam autofocus lenses
  is there any good and fast 21mm lens one can use on the a7ii adapted if needed
  its mid 2000s model maybe 2005
  specify your model at least
  vary the angles between the source of light and the normal of the glass surface until the reflection is gone
  um voitlander   is this a joke
  that doesnt cost 750 im on a budget
why was the 5d mk ii such a legendary camera i feel like during that time no one ever used anything else it was the only camera worth having and it seemed like no one really even switched to the mk iii when it was released
  because it was one of the cheapest full frame bodies had a higher resolution than nikons d700 recorded video the first dslr to do 1080p and the only alternative interchangeable lens body to do so was 4/3s     also canon had a larger full frame presence dating all the way back to 2002 nikon was 2007 so there were plenty of people who had previously had a full frame canon body and appropriate lenses for someone who had an og 5d or a 1ds i/ii the 5d ii was the next logical step for a nikon shooter theyd be coming from crop bodies so they may not have felt the need to upgrade
  i see so why did it last so long then
any tips for scanning negatives recently bought a secondhand plustek opticfilm 7400 and feel that the scans arent as sharp as theyre supposed to be cant post examples right now because the scans are on my computer back home ive read online that the sensor can get out of focus if not being regulary maintained
  because it took canon 4 years to bring out the successor and then another 3/4 years for the next model so the prices of the mk iii would drop nikon also took 4 years to go from the d700 to the d800 but since then theyve had multiple new models every year
  i see i ask because ive been looking at the d850 but everyone seemed to love the 5d mkii the last time i was actively doing photography at the time i was on a beginner crop sensor so i was wondering if the canon options would be better all around either the mkiv or the 5drs or we the moniker is just because it seemed like they made the best camera up until that point
  honestly a nikon is probably going to be better in terms of image quality af and i think theyre better sealed too the reason to choose canon would be because you like their ergos or their glass     also people are no doubt going to call me a shill but sony is also worth considering if an a7r ii/iii falls within your budget bear in mind that there arent as many cheap lens options for fe mount although you can use adapted ef lenses if af performance isnt critical or any other mount if youre fine with manual focus
  am i retarded
according to dxo all the sharpest lenses are on 5drs bodies or sony bodies is this because they havent really tested anything on the d850 yet or are those two bodies just that much better than the d850 every review ive seen said the sony stuff is just as good if not better but people seemed to dog the 5drs yet the numbers seem to indicate its actually the best
  op here why/how the fuck was the file deleted
  faggot boomer janny hate memes   he also so deleted your monthly film expenses wojak   no fun allowed on /p/ these days
  imagine getting offended by this
  chat about considering busting chosis also got deleted mods must be pedos as well  its not like one off topic thread thats active is worse than numerous rate my pic threads outside recent photographs thread or numerous gear related threads outside the gear thread
  yeah who hates these early meme culture epic troll era memes
  rate my pic threads outside recent photographs thread or numerous gear related threads outside the gear thread  fucking this
  it wasnt legendary pretty mediocre camera 5d classic and 5d mark iii are  5d mark ii was just a more usable 5d canonfags bought it in loads only because it had muh megapixels which nikon later went yolo and gave the public even more lol and had 1080p video magic lantern later unlocked even more capabilities which the indie filmmakers could use
  maybe because 5d mark ii was the flagship and posterboi for canon  nikon d850 is the best dslr maybe even best camera ever it does everything from fast burst to big ass prints all in a dependable body
  canon is basically apple of cameras and people buy it because it juzt wrekz even though they are mediocre and havent had any legendary cameras in ages 5d mark iii was the last  nikon is the samsung of cameras and hence the best has all the nostalgic camera features and tech while being an enjoyable experience sad that d850 will be one of their last proper enthusiast cameras i hope they do a d900 to seal the legacy forever
  mainly because of the video features
      so how do you helpful gents feel about   i know number whoring isnt the most important thing but with megapixel counts being as high as they are now im worried the camera too far outstrips the lens for nikon is the 5drs or a7riii really sharper or is it just because they havent tested on d850 bodies
  are you based in the us i know where he lives so we can easily call his local police and say hes been openly discussing his taste for little girls
  are you based in the us if so bad luck youre in a country with freedom of speech where the police dont care about anyone discussing their tastes online
  i think hes gone beyond discussing his tastes online considering all the things he also says here hes at least worth investigating by police last i checked child molestation is illegal even in the us    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific properties
  1 automatism defense  2 wheres the corroborating evidence if youre a detective what do you investigate
  if i can find him talking at length about touching little kids and cp after 5 minutes googling chosis a detective will have much more expertise and resources at tracking down evidence than i do
  so now your evidence to report to the police is i dont know of him having done anything illegal but i bet you can find something if you do your job    thats not the kind of tip off a police force finds very compelling
  police and the general public dont tend to have much sympathy for possible kiddie fiddlers    all im saying is chosis/chris has said and done enough weird shit on here and other forums to warrant serious suspicion and a possible investigation after what has happened in pa lately im sure theyre on the alert for dangerous /r9k/ incels like him anyway police can look into it if theres nothing then theres nothing
  lol one guy shadowing jailbait is warranting police action especially in pa take a look at his retard thats exactly the thing they dont want

  fucking kids illegal  taking photos of kids not illegal    hell most photos are probably of kids
  i know you think youre incredibly smart because of your pharma degree smarter than all the rest of us and that youll never be caught as a result but youre extremely transparent at this point ive heard all these things from you before and your writing style never changes    hope you have a backup plan when all of this crashes around you i used to take some pity on you but after seeing all that child abuse shit i dont anymore its only a matter of time now
  seriously dude its time to give it a rest     so ive taken pictures with kids in them so has everyone else youre the big man when it comes to making baseless assertions online but despite all your threats to make vague and scurrilous allegations your talk seems to stop whenever youre not an anonymous image board     try taking some pictures instead of making stuff up about people who do
      pedos everywhere if someone shows a certain unnormal behaviour to the outside its highly possible that there is an even worse behaviour not shown in this case going up to schools shooting a prédator the fear in their eyes when you chase them style photos of random teenage girls i would not be surprised if he had real rape videos of young underaged girls on his computer    i dont exactly know amarican law but going up to random underaged girls at a school and photographing them without consent cant even be legal in the land of the free if it would be legal the will of the person who does not want to be photographed would be stumbled on imprisoning her image into a photo the other person can view whenever he wants even to fap to
  exactly
  you dont have an expectation of privacy in a public place while you may see it as imprisoning their image in a photograph recent studies have shown that cameras do not actually take a piece of the subjects soul     meanwhile you complain about the scary predator showing a pic of three girls who are not even aware of the camera and if you could that photo as some kind of predatory child pornography well youve got it saved on your computer     indeed i may come to agree with your logic here i would not be surprised if you have snuff videos on your computer showing fiveyearolds being tortured to death in weird satanic ceremonies theres as much evidence for that as any of the things youre claiming
  weve had to deal with chosis on /p/ for over a year now and in that time hes said so much fucked up shit almost daring people to report him for it that its natural to start suspecting him of something    we dont need to have all the evidence or to compile a case against him here were not police thats their job to investigate him and collect what they find from his hard drives or wherever hes gone beyond some weird creepy anon to something more sinister over time and its not right to do nothing about it
  yeah you dont have all the evidence indeed you dont have any of the evidence you just started suspecting him of something     what do you expect anyone to do with your nebulous suspicion you want his hard drives to be searched ok thats going to take a warrant in what possible world do you imagine a judge would issue an order to search someones personal files because someone on the internet suspects him of something  with zero evidence and no clarity about what youre even alleging
  like this anon said  its the behaviour not shown likely being much worse when the outside behaviour is already so fucked up at least over here in the uk if someone is suspected of being a pedophile thats worthy of a real investigation and police always take it seriously i dont know us law inside out but i know it isnt taken kindly over there either like i say its only a matter of time
  the will of the person who does not want to be photographed would be stumbled on  oh noes my arbitrary will and feefees got stumbled upon stop now  seriously whats this retarded line of thinking    there are two things that matter and the law in virtually all countries respects that  1there is no expectation in public spaces or private places that are open to the public  2photography falls under freedom of speech in the broader sense    you can write a report of something you saw in a public space you can write an article about an event happening on a square you can take a photo of something in the street   you can publish distribute profit of the above works    these are treated as equivalents under law thats all there is to it    harassing for instance following someone is a different thing and youre always legally protected from harassment    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makeepsoncamera modelperfection v800/v850camera softwaresilverfast 880 r11 feb 26 2018  74c4f58 2602imagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage width1200image height790
  well many problems could be solved if people could understand other peoples point of view  a i dont share your opinion but i get your point and respect that would make so much things easier instead of all this unnecessary childish and antisocial i am right you are wrong lalalala    some people just dont want to have their photograph taken without their consent for them it feels like loosing control over whats happening to them why is it so hard for some to respect that if you cant respect others why should anyone respect you    this in public space you have no privacy argument give me a reason why this should be valid  we are humans and we are not perfect not everything we do we want to be documented by others eg in photographs we dont just magically become perfect when we leave the stacked stones we call house  thats why here with german laws we have to do the consideration ones interest against one others my interest to not be photographed at the nude beach against your interest of taking photos my interest to not be photographed while eating a schnitzel against your interest of taking photos my interest to not be photographed against your interest of taking photos  the photographers interest has to be very strong to not lose the court case  and dont forgot the new european gdpr

  you /pol/tards are so playable
  get a load of this guy     
how do i get better at postprocessing
  5ds r you meant  no one is sure how dxomark does its testing ive noticed many times the same lens renders differently on different cameras according to their testing lol  dont worry about sharpness too much glass isnt digital and hence doesnt have to render anything nikon has extremely capable glass even their manual focus lenses are sharp if not sharper than the af ones because they had better build quality and lesser glass obstructing sharpness  dont take my word for it watch reviews of lens comparisons for d850 on youtube or go to a store and do the testing yourself  btw lens rentals also has mtf scores
  is this why they have trouble with police
any good black and white film development kits that come with everything you need     also why is it that every single video online suggests unwinding your film in the dark rather than just buying a darkbag or using a red light
  ah yes too many seemingly random letters really just struggling to decide between the 850 and ds or should i wait and compare the mkv to the 850 wherever it bothers to show up
  this guy is fuckin retarded
  go ahead use a red light with unexposed film itll be fun
  from my understanding it is okay with color film but not black and white though its highly possible that i am retarded

  looked it up i am retarded thank you
  some people just dont want to have their photograph taken without their consent  thats fine they can want or wish or hope for anything really    there are people in public that dont want their photo taken and there are photographers that want to photograph those people each group wants their wishes fulfilled otherwise they feel theyre not in control  this is a conflict of wants and in such conflicts the law has the final say  unambiguously definitively youre allowed to capture in photographs or canvas or pen and paper or music what your eyes can see when in a public space theres nothing more to it its clear and absolute    this in public space you have no privacy argument give me a reason why this should be valid  it is valid because the law explicitly made it valid  if you want a moral motivation why the law made it valid is because a public space is a public domain you cant restrict someone from looking into the streets thats a gross violation of his rights and once he gazed at the streets you cant restrict his freedom of speech about the events he witnessed he can can exercise his freedom of speech through a poem a novel an article a song an oil painting or a photo    to argue that there should be an expectation of privacy in public spaces is to argue there should be a restriction of freedom of speech in public spaces dont take my photo cause i dont want you to  shut up because i dont like what youre saying     not everything we do we want to be documented by others eg in photographs we dont just magically become perfect when we leave the stacked stones we call house  thats ok but you cant censor others because you have body image issues   maybe im a politician and im not perfect i fuck up i dont want others to see my fuckup but i cant censor the media cause theyre capturing my fuckups    in a society conflicts of interest are solved by applying the law the law is clear in this case    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makeepsoncamera modelperfection v800/v850camera softwaresilverfast 880 r11 feb 26 2018  74c4f58 2602imagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution600 dpivertical resolution600 dpiimage width1200image height788
why the fuck the fuck fuck fuck is normal film three times more expensive now that its out of style
useless question but im curious  why does the liveview on my dslr go blurry and grainy whenever theres no battery in it
  this question does not make sense     live view is when a dslr shows a live picture of whats on the sensor on the lcd screen it cant do any of that without a battery
  disregard my previous post i suck cocks  why does the viewfinder on my dslr go blurry and grainy whenever theres no battery in it

  you just answered your own question idiot
  it needs the power from the battery to keep the lens aperture open
  are you sure because it behaves the same even without a lens on
i selfload my bw films and while shooting  frame 14 my camera rewinded the whole film back into the canister  just to make surecan i put back in the film shoot 15 shots in complete darkness with cap on and then reuse again 
  what dslr do you have when theres no lens on the dslr youre essentially looking at the matt ground glass in the viewfinder since theres no lens focusing an image to it when you take the battery out the lens aperture closes at least on my nikons and the viewfinder image goes very dark i can still focus the lens and see the difference but it is difficult
  yeah you should be good to do that
  yes no need for complete darkness just smallest aperture fastest shutter speed and a hand over your lens works well enough for me
    thx  what causes the camera to rewind the film thinking its the end  iam using the contax g2 and bulkloaded the can
what makes a photo good  im seriously asking im a newbie in this hobby and i want to improve and gain some distance from the smartphone snapshotting ive read here you need to practice and i agree but my shooting is still purely instinctual if we dont count the rule of thirds which makes me feel like im directionless and my lack of art background and knowledge doesnt help either
  in a society conflicts of interest are solved by applying the law the law is clear in this case  maybe where you life but not in other countries    i bet you only follow such an opinion if a law benefits you as soon it doesnt you will be like that law is unfair it should be changed it doesnt apply to me blabla    you are no jurist thats clear all you may have done is read a law and now think you know what it means and how its used laws non us at least however have a lot of terms in them you need a definition for and those definition can vary for every fucking problem you have x amount of different opinions jurisdiction a prevailing opinion and lesser opinions  eg what is private space what is freedom of speech and what applies to it is a snapshit with no artistic documentative or any else purpose covert by freedom of speech is somehthing else maybe more important than freedom of speech eg a specific persons interest  law is not black and white its difficult as fuck and thats why we get paid so much    furthermore laws change in the 50s rape inside marriage was still legal did this mean it was morally ok to rape your wife hell no and thats why it got changed in some countries homosexuality is still punished with death sentences in others they can even marry now the publics opinion on topics change the world around us changes so the laws change as well some laws faster some slower    in film times you could not easily make infite copies of a photo share it to the whole world onto the internet losing all control over it manipulate it easily of course you need stronger protecting laws    because its the law  is such a stupid term maybe think for youself sometimes
  composition lines motiv that becomes a part in your life for a moment that makes you join mentally and become curious what exactly happened will happencannot happen how will it end how didit start and so on
can i use efs lenses with the bmpcc4k
  composition lines  while i can kinda understand the rest of your post these two things are a bit too generic for me to understand i mean i can understand you have to take a picture in which the elements appear arranged in pleasant manner and i can understand that you can identify lines from what youre framing and use them in your composition but it still doesnt tell me how to get any good on that in other words i can iterate the initial question what makes a composition good  i feel retarded making such basic questions but i just have no clue
  less is more  can also mean to cut out the less important things off the frame    see it this wayan amateur cook will cost and eat everything but once you get pro or experienced you will sort off things and see differences quickly etc
  its a difficult question theres all kinds of elements to analyze in composition and once done you need to ask does this make the photo stronger take hcbs photo of the cyclist the very basic thing about that photo is that the cyclist is moving its supposed to be dynamic all the lines of the handrail and road push the cyclist forward its a swirling movement that indeed feels dynamic how to get better at it read a book about composition and look at lots of photographs the photographers eye by michael freeman is quite basic but does the job you should be able to find it online also there should be a thread where people posted some photobook pdfs dunno if it 404d yet
  its a difficult question  i expected that  the photographers eye by michael freeman is quite basic but does the job  will try giving a read thanks
  bump pls respond
    it has a micro four thirds mount and not an efs mount so no
  maybe where you life but not in other countries  its very clear in europe and most first and second world countries      i dont know what youre even arguing about though  are you suggesting that the law is morally/ethically wrong and it should be disobeyed    i dont believe its morally wrong   freedom of speech is a basic human right its one of the unquestionable pillars of modern democracies thats why its constitutionally protected in every country with a constitution and not just protected by the civil code    you cant allow freedom of speech without allowing freedom of photography in public places if youre fine with restricting freedom of speech more like abolishing it cause either you have it or you dont  then you can make this argument but you cant pick one and not the other    is a snapshit with no artistic documentative or any else purpose covert by freedom of speech  hmm riddle me this is an dumb opinion with no factual logical or any argumentative merit covered by freedom of speech  is somehthing else maybe more important than freedom of speech eg a specific persons interest  are you for real a random persons feelings are above a basic human right  remember freedom of speech is recognised as a basic human right freedom to not be offended is nothing just entitlement    laws change  they do and they did the current unquestionable freedom of speech is the culmination of these changes   do you want it revoked do you think based on your example that freedom of speech is like marriage rape in the 50s legal but wrong and thus ripe for change    in film times you could not easily make infite copies of a photo share it to the whole world onto the internet losing all control over it manipulate it easily of course you need stronger protecting laws  protecting laws for whom the photographer there are plenty already and the copyright of the work is more protected than ever
  also the only cases in western countries can think of with restriction of photography are edge cases    1 the uk with trafalgar square again mostly applicable to staged commercial work and not photojournalism or street photography also remember that the uk is a parliamentary monarchy with no written constitution where the upper parliamentary body with full vetoing power is hereditary/appointed for life and not elected    2 germany this one is not surprising cause germany has the heaviest speech censorship in europe many reasons why thats the case mostly because of the very recent nazi past in combination with not being adequately punished for it gave rise to a collective national guilt that the people shouldnt be trusted with absolute freedom of speech but a restricted version of it when you restrict freedom of speech its normal to restrict photography as well as it falls under the former  the cherry on top was an ancient law from 1900 when some journalists bribed their way into the private residence and took a photo of dead bismark on his bed the public and political establishment was a bit buttrustled to see their beloved leader in that state and voted for a law restricting photography to prevent similar cases in the future
    not natively but you can get ef to m4/3 adapters unfortunately with ef lenses having an electronically actuated aperture youll need an expensive adapter unless youre fine with shooting wide open you can get adapter with an adjustable aperture built in but i have no idea how well they work i would imagine they dont improve image quality as much if at all and probably just function more like an adjustable nd filter
    i think we can agree to disagree since you lack the emotional intelligence and ability to view another persons viewpoint    have fun with your freedom of speech and go back to sucking trumps dick /pol/tard
  you lack the emotional intelligence and ability to view another persons viewpoint  youre not arguing about understanding the other persons viewpoint youre arguing for the other persons viewpoint dictating my behaviour    i can understand the viewpoint very well but im not bound by it  its pretty ironic to suggest that i should understand the other persons viewpoint without suggesting first that the other person understands mine especially when i have the moral and legal high ground    also  me  trump  sweet summer child

  youre asking for a a fast 21mm film lens on a budget youre asking for too much
  21mms are either slow or very expensive you can get an omsystem 21mm f/35 for like 200 but more typical more hifi stuff like voigtländer 21mm f/4 colorskopar are like 350 plus shipping and dont work well at all on fullframe digital crop only
  wanted something better
  any cybershit that fits your budget got pic related for less than 40 fits in pocket along phone less conspicuous 8x zoom decent for being a creep without getting close    decent pictures with good light or grainy one for muh street/film feel    pretty sure there are better ones within your budget
absolute stupid noob inbound how does focusing work on a rangefinder do you just estimate/measure the distance to your subject or what
  the rangefinder mechanism measures the subject distance when its set to the correct distance two overlaid images line up and that is linked to the lens which is precisely calibrated to be in focus at the same distance
what is back focusing and is that the reason none of my images appear sharp even at shutter speeds faster than 1/1000 using a d5100 and 35mm dx
what is this the one you have with you meme i keep seeing here
  its pretty simple and actually good advice when used appropriately it means work with what you have wondering what gear would be better shouldnt matter because you dont have it the gear that you do have is better because you do have it    you could also take it to mean that even the best gear that you have is no good if its too big heavy awkward expensive etc for you to carry it with you my a7 is technically better than my rx100 in many ways but i almost always have my rx100 on me so if i dont have the a7 then the rx100 is the better camera
why the heck does gimp process the entire image instead of just showing a thumbnail that fits on the screen it takes forever to work on high resolution images when every little move takes forever and all i can do is watch helplessly as the image slowly forms back in the tiny zoomed out frame
i collect swords and was wondering how to take photos of them because they are large and reflective they seem a bit harder than just normal product photography when its done well all thats left is the subject and the fine details not a single thing distracting how do i achieve this    pic is an example
any guides to buying a good laptop for optimal photo editing    im in dire need of getting a new laptop within a 1200 limit i have been a cheap bastard and been using the same 2011 macbook with gt 640m and 4 gb ram that ive been using for my photo editing and now its on its last leg and i need an upgrade what is the best i can get with  ssd 512 minimum preferably  good enough gpu for high in photo editing its my major side hustle  16gb ram i want to actually be able to multitask while running ps/lightroom  good ips screen at least 72 ntsc  good viewing angles so im not stuck looking head on  15 inches because im blind as fuck even with my glasses    all research ive done just keeps shilling me xps 15 which is 1800 minimum for good specs surely there has gotta be a better option i prefer not having all the new shit like 2in1 touchscreen or anything like that just a good laptop with a solid touchpad with a bottom click for photo editing    would it be best to wait for black friday/cyber monday shit    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandcolor space informationsrgbimage width500image height500
  i got a razer blade 2017 on ebay for 850 and its a huge step up from my previously used 2012 macbook pro 13 has pretty much all you listed tho i keep the green glowing razer logo covered with a sticker despite it being one of the more discrete gaming laptops
ive been traveling a lot lately and im tired of using my phone for taking pictures whats a good quality compact camera
  could also try the dell inspiron 15  i7 7700hq 1920x1080 has at least all the stats you mentioned or better at a hair under your max budget     i have it myself its extremely powerful and doesnt scream gaymen laptop despite looking a little the part  the only nitpick i have is that the screen can seem a tad dark even on max brightness and it autothrottles the cpu/gpu even on high performance when running on battery games well nonetheless and is more than enough for photoediting seems rugged enough in terms of build quality but i wouldnt go treating it too roughly isnt a fingerprint or scratch magnet for what its worth and has a fairly passable airflow design    see the specs for yourself the first amazon link to come up should suffice although i bought it directly from dell    inb4 tldr fuck off shill
so i want to get my terminology straightened out with an example    you have the same picture three times  the first has the foreground in razor sharp focus and the background in delicious bokeh blur  the second imageis the same but the background is a little sharper  the third has both in almost perfect focus  putting aside whether such photos are physically possible which image is it that describes/represents depth of field or high depth of field the best    image kinda related for topic just swap around which is in focus    also is it a high or low fstop that produces the first/third image is it the aperture size at all that is responsible for such blur/depth of field or something else    i just want to get the terminology straight    sorry its a few different weird questions but these terms are thrown around on /p/ like hot potatoes so often its hard to follow what is referring to what
  man i didnt expect questions this stupid in /sqg/
how do i get lightroom for free on mac i need a dumbed down step by step please

  ok mate look at pic its the focus scale on an old lens numbers on top show distance yellow for feet and white for meters thicc vertical white line shows you at what distance youre focusing colored lines show the depth of field depth of field means from where to where the objects in the picture will be more or less in focus see the colors of the lines match the colors of the numbers the numbers are the aperture so when this lens is focused to 4 meters if you set aperture to f/22 everything from 3 meters to 6 meters and a half will be in focus if you set it to f/4 stuff from more or less 38 to 43 will be in focus also an object at 10 meters will be blurry in both cases but in the case of f/4 it will be much more blurry other thing thats useful to know if a tele lens say 100mm and a wide angle say 18mm are both focused at the same distance and at the same f stop the wider lens will have a bigger depth of field more stuff in focus was that clear enough    and now please do your own reading google how do cameras work or something like that    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesphotographerchristoph breitkopfimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution28 dpcmvertical resolution28 dpcm
hi i bought a d3100 recently im an architecture student and im looking to buy my first lens currently using the 1855mm kit lens whats the best cheap lens for architecture thats not a tiltshift cause those are too damn expensive and im not able to buy them yet
  go wide and get the tokina 1116mm
  thanks seems to have finally clicked for me  newer kit lenses dont have this sort of oldschool colourful markings on them   i always found it confusing how a smaller aperture meant being able to have stuff from a larger depth in focus  however it explains why someone once told me if i wanted to have nice bokeh it meant using the lowest zoom and lowest fnumber for that zoom level and focus on something close up to force background blur    ill delve into the physics of light refraction to figure out my confusion in a little more depth hah but for now this has helped
   which image is it that describes/represents depth of field or high depth of field the best  the third image described where everythings in focus would be described as having wide/large/high/greater/etc depth of field     is it a high or low fstop that produces the first/third image  low f/number wide or large or fast aperture aperture is a little confusing because the smaller number means a larger aperture which gives you shallower depth of field so thats why i try to use terms like wide aperture rather than high aperture or large f/stop or whateverthe latter phrases can be a bit ambiguous because you dont really know if the person means large f/number or large aperture size
  man i didnt expect questions this stupid in /sqg/  first off fuck you for shaming someone for asking a stupid question in the stupid questions thread thats exactly why this thread is here you probably did stupid things and had stupid questions when you were just starting out too    second the terminology is confusing and a lot of people say things extra ambiguously like large f/stop which could mean a physically large aperture or a large f/number which are opposites so its not a stupid question at all
  newer kit lenses dont have this sort of oldschool colourful markings on them   yeah camera companies started saving on some useful features and dumb down their cameras to sell more around the nineties who needs a focus scale when the camera focuses for you who needs a depth of field indicator if you can just chimp after each shot to check the lcd why have dedicated aperture rings or shutter speed dials if you can just select mountain flower or guy with quarter moon meanwhile showing you a picture of their preimprovement equipment is all you needed to get it depressing  have fun with the physics books and remember to test it at least with digital its free
  its a stupid question because you should already know that base level shit before coming here the question he asked is literally remedial photography level shit fucking wikipedia could tell him that shit

  its down my friend
  yeah noticed real bummer was hoping to get capture one myself    speaking of which is there any point to shooting in rawjpg instead of just raw once i get set up and am comfortable with postproduction image conversion    at the moment im not at the level where i will/can fill up a 128gb sdcard with the one battery i have the most photos ive taken on one day before the only battery died was around 8900  should prolly stock up on basic /gear/ first
hey guys how do you think will a sony a6000 function for a beginner looking to get into photography with the 1855 lens that you buy it with
  works well
  have it myself cant complain if possible buy the bundle with the 55210mm lens included  useful to have both
  also it comes with a 1650 not 1855 if you zoomed in on your uploaded pic youd even see it
what is the best way to take portraits of myself without someone else helping me  so basically all i have at the moment is my camera and a tripod but framing is usually an issue due to the size of my apartment and i dont have a wireless shutter button either i just do it via snapbridge on my phone which sometimes works sometimes doesnt    i need to take some pictures to understand what focal lengths are ideal for a given situation how to handle movement and to learn how to pose myself as well so that i hopefully dont look too stupid in pictures other people take of me
  perfect for a beginner and there are a lot of early black friday deals going on right now basically the body  2 kit lenses  swag for 598         
is there a performance difference on sony a7iii between sigma art lens with ef mount and mc11 adapter or sigma art lens with e mount    ef mount lenses are considerably cheaper so buying an adapter once and then the lenses could save some money but is it worth it    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2015 macintoshimagespecific propertiesimage created20160228t1844190500flashno flash compulsoryimage width640image height330

nondestructive editting  this is meme right has anyone ever come to an image later and cursed himself that he didnt use proper steps that can be retraced
  yes
best lens for dx camera for limited space portraiture thinking 20mm or 24mm f18
  if youre talking headshots then thats a bit wide id go for 3035mm probably an f/14 sigma
  this is meme right has anyone ever come to an image later and cursed himself that he didnt use proper steps that can be retraced  its not a meme its useful as hell i think the problem here is that you dont really understand what nondestructive editing is    dont think of it like being able to go back and undo/redo all of your steps think of it like being able to go back and change any of the steps while leaving everything else the same    for example one of the first things i do when i open up a raw is to adjust the white balance imagine that i do that then do like 37 other edits then decide the white balance isnt quite right with a nondestructive editor i just adjust the white balance to something else with a destructive editor id basically have to start from scratch because the white incorrect white balance would already be baked into all of the pixel data    or think about cropping you crop your photo a bit do some other edits then decide you dont want it quite so cropped in with a nondestructive editor you just change the crop and everything else stays the same with a destructive editor the pixels you cropped are just gone unless you start again from the raw    it just makes life much much easier
  i assume cap1 does nondestruc editing about to install it
i have an old digital camera canon powershot a400 its from about 2006 i think i was just wondering will this take better photos than my samsung s5 galaxy phone     the camera specs are in pic related
  the only thing that old camera can do over your s5 is optically zoom    every other stat is about 10 tomes worse than the s5 alone the detail resolution 31mp is outclassed by the s5s 16mp    chuck it in the binat most it could be used as a retro point shoot but even your s5 would do a better job
  i have another point and shoot that i just found its a canon ixus 135 pic related is a side by side comparison of the specs of the s5 camera and the canon ixus 135 camera if i read this correctly the ixus can shoot all the way up to 4k which absolutely rapes my phone
    forgot pic
  i have an old digital camera   my samsung s5 galaxy  the phones probably going to win but heres a question why not just try them both side by side look at the results and decide for yourself which you like better
  why not just try them both side by side look at the results and decide for yourself which you like better  i dont have batteries atm nor an sd card wasnt sure if it was worth buying batteries/sd card to test it     now ill probably chuck that old one out
  yes the ixus is worth keeping whether you spend on the sd card and batteries for it too is up to you  i myself have a small medion ps with 12mp and my oneplusx has some better and some worse specs so hey its a matter of what fits your situation  the a6000 i have rapes everything i own except a rollei actioncam 630 for video also on bulkiness it isnt small enough to fit in a larger pocket unless you use the kit 1650 or smaller
  thanks heaps anon i am considering buying a new digital camera just because my s5 cannot take good photos in low light conditions ill see how well the ixus does
  give it to goodwill or some other thrift store better than throwing it away
  literally me
how do i go out and take photos without looking like a faggot or tryhard are there any generally good locations where there arent other people around but you can usually get good photographs
  spend that money on a tripod any camera is okay in low light if it isnt moving and you slowcook use the longest exposure with the lowest iso  get a better camera when your skills outclass your equipment by two factors the better camera you then get should then outclass your skills by two factors so you have ample room to improve further and learn what the equipment can do  also what this  anon said then again so many kids these days run around with better cameras on their phones i fail to find a situation where someone would need such a camera from a thrift store     on a related note would an interesting competition among professional/semiprofs be to have a whole box of similarly worse crapcams three hours to take 5 good photos on a sunny day in a city and then put the results on a wall for public vote   similar to how pro magic the gathering players might play a pauperdraft cube just for fun since everyone maximises from the minimum they have
  where do you live that you cant get unique locations
  how do i go out and take photos without looking like a faggot or tryhard  by not worrying about that i want to take photos but im afraid someone might think im the sort of person who likes taking photos fuck off with that shit     good locations  yes     i cant really answer this further without knowing where you live and what sort of locations youre looking for but the answer is going to be yes regardless go out look for locations take pictures dont concern yourself with what other people think
  its more of a worry that theyll think im not the sort of person who likes taking photos but that im only taking them because i want attention or something there are many people who are like that at this college and i dont want to be mixed in with them   i guess ill try and be less selfconscious
  holy shit just take the damn photos  put on a flannel shirt tight jeans and grow a beard if you want to look the part or be a dirty hobo like tarentino it doesnt fucking matter    take photos take photos until people actually complain take photos until you get arrested for trespassing take photos until you get injunctions   just fucking take photos
  i have a nikon dx 35mm 18g with my d7200 looking at distances of 510 feet in a small room i was just wondering if there was something better

rookie photographer here   im using a canon eos 80d with a kit lens   im going outdoor rock climbing tonight and the only light sources available will be headlamps car head lights and my cameras inbuilt flash    what settings should i use for the best results with this limited lighting any general tips for this type of shooting
met and befriended a newly added ufc fighter how do i manage getting good shots while he is training indoors    i needed to shoot shutter speed st 250 for all still does this mean i go as far as i need to take it with my aperture and iso  i got good shots with   sp 250  iso 4000  aperture 28    also side question can i get a gig shooting ringside at a ufc event through him or is it strictly through the venue
the focal lengths on dx lenses are scaled right      i know if im shooting 18 on a dc its like shooting 26 or so on a full frame but thats if um using a fx lens yeah      if im shooting 18 on a dc cam with a dc lens its the same as 18 on an fx cam with an fx lens      if thats right then the only time i need to do conversions is if im using an fx lens on a fx cam
dx dx dx etc
  no focal lengths arent converted 18 on a crop sensor is still going to give you a 28mm field of view regardless of whether its a dx or fx lens
  nope     on a crop camera an 18mm crop lens and an 18mm full frame lens are going to give you the same field of view lenses are labeled with their actual focal lengths which are not affected by the camera theyre attached to
    so then id im shooting 18 on a dx cam and a dx lens     im shooting 28 to an fx cam      but i guess the conversion really doesnt matter since im used to what 18 feels like through that setup      basically the reason im asking is cause i was thinking of picking up a cheap wide lens to muck around with and vaguely considered futureproofing with a fx lens    concern being that if i bought just for example a 12 fx that it would show no difference between that and my kit 1850    so new knowledge gained that concern is wrong
    specifically light trails      countless times especially in commercial work and print work      best lens for dx camera for limited space portraiture  the narrowest you can get away with      how do i go out and take photos without looking like a faggot or tryhard  you dont you just learn it doesnt matter because youre not 12  are there any generally good locations where there arent other people around but you can usually get good photographs  literally anywhere with limited footfall woodlands landscape parks etc isnt this obvious    but that im only taking them because i want attention or something  i assumed you were just selfconscious thats even crazier nobody gives a shit about you or thinks about you when youre shooting outside of the occasional less than 1 in 1000 in my experience so far street photo person asking you not to shoot them      im assuming you already went but for reference   af or caf if its good enough  auto iso to a limit of whatever fits your camera tends to be around 3200  shutter speed as low as you can get away with probably circa 1/50 if youre rockclimbing  exposure compensation  spot metering    shine a light on their face if youre having focus problems go wide ibis if you have it      as above most of your problems come from low light get a good speedlight and get familiar with it or manage the light around the floor if youre already getting good shots then worry about getting close enough and nailing focus consistently as thats usually the clincher for gigs like this
  yep a 12mm fx lens or dx for that matter would be 6mm wider than your 1855 which is a significant amount at that end of the focal length range and then if you upgrade itll be much wider
  new stupid question    is a wider lens inherently a faster lens since it can gather light from a wider area
  nope well its true that a wider focal length with the same physical size of the lens opening in a simple lens system gathers more light but the whole point of f/stops is that you dont have to concern yourself with thatit abstracts out the physical size of the lens so you just have to know that f/28 on a 12mm throws the same amount of light on your sensor as f/28 on a 1200mm lens     the f/number notation actually means focal length divided by number equals the physical size of the aperture opening so a 100mm f/2 lens has the same size opening as a 200mm f/4 or a 50mm f/1 but the different focal lengths mean they gather different amounts of light on the other hand a 50mm f/4 100mm f/4 and 200mm f/4 all have different physical aperture sizes125mm 25mm and 50mm respectivelybut all pour the same amount of photons on the sensor there were many years after the invention of photography before they figured out that that ratio works like that where youd have to calculate your exposure differently depending on the focal length of your lens
  in addition to what the guy below you said a wider lens does have a speed advantage in that it can be hand held at a slower shutter speed its proportional to the focal length so if for example you can hand hold a 28mm at 1/30 without any camera shake then youll be able to manage a 14mm at 1/15 of course with the slower shutter speed you will get motion blur if your subject is moving
might not be the right thread but will a sony a6000 battery grip fit on a nex6
  i dont believe so based on the fact that companies advertising a6000 grips only lost them as being for the a6000 or a6300
the only lens i own is a 35mm dx nikon on a d5100 camera body i want to step up to full frame but im on a budget im open to swapping to canon since i really like the build quality but id have to start with a cheaper camera in either case i want a good full frame lens to start building up into a full frame system so whether its a good fullframe canon lens with a cheap body to start or just a full frame nikon lens what do you guys recommend i was thinking a lens that can be a workhorse and go from decently wide to decently long maybe a 2470
how do extension tubes affect photographs taken from far away ie not macro photography
  unless you prefer the canon controls and ergos or have a hard on for specific canon lenses stick with nikon canon sensors only got good with the 5d iv but it seems like that is probably out of your budget      tubes drastically shorten the focusing distance so unless youre using really short ones you wont be able to focus very far away at all other than that there wont really be any effect on the image
  its not technically out of budget i just would prefer to build up slowly so i dont want up with a bunch of gear i dont need eventually i will get the best of whatevers out there which seems like the d850 based on what ive been seeing but since there was such a long time where canon bodies were better i cant say which would be better to own over the long run
  but since there was such a long time where canon bodies were better i cant say which would be better to own over the long run  there wasnt there was 3 years where the 5d was the only mid range option until nikon brought out the d700 but since then nikon has been on top they have better af and better sensors and probably always will because canon wont buy sensors from sony
i have this eos sl2  its my first fancy camera    id like to play around with some experimental shit is there any way to digitally and precisely control the auto focus remotely    like say i want to do a focus zoom over the course of multiple photos if i want to shoot 20 photos in sequential order on a still subject in a controlled environment but need the focus moved between 0 min focus and 100 infinity focus in 5 steps without touching the camera is that possible    if not what kind of setup would be needed for something like this
  think of a bellows focussing system it just means you cant retract your bellows to infinity anymore since you put that piece in there
  dating the d700 was better than the 5d2 is an outright lie and you know it until the d800 nikon was shit
    pro tip nikon and canon have been about equal to each other since the 80s oftentimes one will have a slight advantage over the other in some way but neither so much that you can really say the others cameras are shit    people who say one is obviously better than the other point to things like abstract numbers on dxomark or 100 crops of test charts in actual usage the differences are entirely invisible
i bought a 55mm super takumar but the distance scale ring is moving and its really inconvenient  should i try to tighten the tiny screws on it
  the d700 has better noise performance especially at low isos much better af and double the burst rate the 5dii has a higher resolution and shoots video two fairly different cameras either could be considered better depending on what the user was after before that canon was the best option because it was the only option but yeah the d800 stomps the 5d iii and both camera out in 2012
  but yeah the d800 stomps the 5d iii and both camera out in 2012  the 5d3 goes to iso25600 and noise is less visible at higher isos vs 6400 6fps vs 4 41 crosstype af points vs 15     of course the d800 has significantly higher resolution and i believe it wins for color depth but my point is its not a full on curb stomp in either directionthe 5d3 has advantages the d800 has advantages but overall theyre pretty close
  my mistake homie i hadnt checked out the specs in a long time dont really give a shit about dslrs anymore now that mirrorless is king and didnt realise the 5d iii had the improved af system i thought it was only with the iv that they stepped their game up i also thought that the d800 had a better burst rate using the battery grip but it seems that its only when shooting in crop mode 6fps up from 5fps
    what 5d4 v 850 v dsr
is it true that prime lenses are sharper than zoom lenses     thanks in advanced
  not universally there are cheap primes and nice quality zooms
  generally yeah since its hard for a zoom lens to be sharp at all focal distances     check out dxomark or similar for sharpness rankings by lens
how much does it realistically matter that sony doesnt use uncompressed rawfiles on say an a6300 is this noticeable
i know some cameras have a built in level you can choose to display on screen but could it also be used for perspective correction like having the option to adjust the image by however many degrees the built in level was reading it as off by do any cameras already do this
  its probably better to make the adjustment based on how distorted the building appears rather than to assume that the cameras level is precisely calibrated and the building is perfectly level
  if you have to ask it doesnt matter to you some people do post process their images to the absolute max and there every bit counts
  they often are its not exactly a rule though in fact you can even get some very sharp cheap zooms
is there anything better for a beginner than the a6000 with the kit lens in the same price range 500
    it actually does matter you get this kind of stuff and while its usually completely unnoticeable on jpegs and even blank raws it becomes more an more apparent as you process your images its harder to work with underexposed and overexposed images and your colour editing work is effected as well honestly its really a dumb idea of sony to still have it it should be a really easy patch to implement it into all their bodies but i guess that they dont want to patch real raw into their older bodies so they can sell the new ones
    i suppose but im looking into possibly buying the camera and since ill probably get more into photography i might notice in the future right      thats what i read as well  what about this tool that supposedly credibly repairs these compression artifacts on sonyrawfiles 
  is there a way to use this thing offline
  is there a way to use this thing offline  from what i read no but i also have not used it in any way since i only just deciding on a camera  apparently he does give out sourcecode though if you ask directly

is my understanding of shutter speed and iso here correct    exposure time/shuttter speed gives you more light at tthe cost of higher sensitivtty to movement you can use quicker speeds to be less suscepetable to jitter but the imaage will be darker you can up the iso to compensate and increaase brighttnss but at the cost of film grain low iso and slow shutter speeds are ideal assuming a static targett and steady hands but you need to speed up exposure to compensate for jitter or a moving target and then iso to compensate for darkness
  its more or less right but there are some caveat   your hidden assumption is that aperture is remaining constant which isnt necessarily the case unless your lens is broken youre using a smartphone or you absolutely want to use a particular aperture which might not be the case if you still have these kind of doubts  film grain  if youre using a digital camera what you get is noise which isnt exactly the same thing as film grain if youre using film then yes youll have more noticeable grain however if youre shooting film you just cant change iso on the fly as with digital since its a physical property of the film itself so until you expend the roll and reload another one or use another camera with another roll with different iso you wont be able to manipulate that setting and youll have to adjust exposure juggling with shutter speed and aperture aperture however will have an impact on the depth of field of your picture but thats another topic  low iso and slow shutter speeds are ideal assuming a static targett and steady hands  yes but remember that theres a point as a rule of thumb when the reciprocal of the shutter speed is lower than the focal lenght of your lens in which you shouldnt shoot free handed and have to rely on a tripod to avoid camera shake unless your digital camera has some sort of stabilization
ok guys heres one   if i have an isoinvariant sensor camera and my base iso is 100 but i want to get to iso50wouldnt i be able to simulate that if i shot at iso100 with exp1 and then in post i would just set the exposure back to 0  wouldnt that make it a iso50 shot am i talking autism here or would this be an actual thing
why is it that all camera manucturers suck big dick    f56  sharp subject but only a part of the scene is in focus  f11  soft subject but everthing is in focus    why is this why cant all lenses into sharpness at high fnumber
  i wanted to try panning with my dslr but thats illegal unless i know the driver and it would be likely some of the drivers would get out of the car to get in a fight  ive done some successful panning with a point and shoot camera but theres no way i will point a big professionallooking camera to strangers faces or cars    maybe with a big tele lens so they dont see me
  yeah thatll work      because physics the loss of sharpness at small apertures is due to diffraction and theres no way lens manufacturers can get around that
  shutter speed 8 seconds to 1/1600th of a second starry sky mode 15 seconds 30 seconds 60 seconds  looking at its manual i see youve only photo modes everything you select will have some kind of auto mode selected it should be possible to get something decent out of it but itll involved a lot of trial and error fooled around with one of my relatives and theyre honestly harder to work with than with pro camera and when i finally thought i got something going on battery went dead id even go an say that cam makers are shooting themselves dumbing them down like they do people pick them up never learn a thing from them think dslrs are even harder to use and just use phones instead  high end pnshoots are different story ill be on a lookout for some cheap ass older gen pnshoot cameras look primarily at controls they offer raw shooting is desirable but most importantly look if its got some kind of shutter aperture or manual modes and as many dials as possible quality premium pnshoot cams that used to go for 1000k can be found for 100200 eurodollars
is it possible to use a flash that only has a hotshoe mount on a camera that only has a pc sync port there must be away right
  thanks anon i searched for adapters but could only find the ones you insert into a camera hotshoe to add a pc sync
    it would work just mind your highlights  exposing 1 increases your risk of clipping details on highlights when you go to reduce exposure in post you might end up with flat grey areas if youre not careful
should i get 5dmk3 or 6dmk2 or something from nikon offerings like d800 or d750 i dont have any lens for either mount but i need ff for low light dof i dont want mirrorless   and should it be better to buy used or gray imports and if imports where to get good imports to europe
really really dumb question incoming  is there such a thing as bad bokeh  im not talking about bokeh light or the shallowness but is there such a thing as bad looking out of focus on some lenses  i swear there is because ive had some lenses produce cleaner dof than some at the same settings
  its entirely subjective some people will like something some will like something else generally you have some top end lenses designed and touted for pleasing bokeh last buch of olympus primes come to mind but its still entirely up to taste
using wide angle lens shots as spotter for telephoto at infinity  you should get exactly the same perspective and everything just everything closer and better detailed or am i missing something
  as long as the camera to subject distance is the same then the perspective is the same are you talking about spotting with the wide angle and then switching the lens to the tele presumably using the centre focus point to mark your subject seems awkward and time consuming id just slap a red dot in the hot shoe
  not exactly just contemplating of getting wide angles shots for documentation and future planning
is it too much to ask that a company make a 70200mm f/2 instead of f/28
i rented a rebel t6 to use att a museum i flew out across the country for after some finalging i figured out what i should be doing in terms of iso and exposure compensation gave up on trying to do manual shutter speed stuff and am just sticking to having that set to auto though     most of the photos ive been taking have been coming out good but the range of focus in the image is narrower then id like i know the trade offs between shutter speed and iso but not with aperture/focal range/whatever    whats the downside to adjuistting stuff tto haave more stuff in focus am i bettter off just zooming out more so more of what im targetting tto photo is in the focal range without actually messing with tthe focal radius/range itself or does zooming out not have tthee same radius oof the focal range relativee to the ttotal size of tthe image proportionally as when zoomed in
  but the range of focus in the image is narrower then id like      let me first state that i am in no way an expert on this subject to get more stuff in focus you have to use higher fnumber like f8 or f11 but the sharpness in your images could become softer this can be negated by resizing your images to really tiny resolutions like 2000x1333 pixels and then applying some sharpening    however if you need 100 crop full resolution maybe try getting your hands on a prime lens fixed focal lenght not zoomable in any way since those are generally sharper because the lens engineers only have the fixed focal length to work at    my canon midrange dsrl kit lens is sharp at f56 but not much is in focus if i increase to f11 more is in focus but the image is noticable softer    i also have a cheap canon 50mm lens and even at f11 it is much much sharper however 50mm wont be likely to capture museum objects if they are in narrow quarters    are you using a tripod there can also be some motion shakeblur especially at the edges if you are shooting handheld and at lower shutting speedo    also some zoom lenses are more sharper at different focal lengthes because it apparently is hard for lens engineers to make every focal lenght sharp for zoomer lens    additional notes i am not professional
    alright thanks anon    also what exif field misplays the amount of exposure compensation i know theres got to be some field for it in the metadata somewhere since the photo viewing mode on the camera displays the compensation setting used for each photo as seen witth tthe / 1 here    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesamsungcamera modelsmj327tcamera softwarej327tuvs2arc1maximum lens aperturef/19focal length 35mm equiv30 mmimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage created20181121 005840exposure time1/30 secfnumberf/19exposure programnormal programiso speed rating160lens aperturef/19brightness09 evexposure bias0 evmetering modespotflashno flashfocal length247 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width2576image height1932exposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardunique image idm05lsja00nm m05lskb03na_

samyang 85mm ƒ/14 as if  any red flags to not buy i have a canon 5d2
for black friday  should i go with an a7 for 770 or a6300 for 800
  how much does it realistically matter  0 outside of night/astro stuff where you wouldnt be using an a6xxx anyway  ive shot astro on a6000 and a7iii and even using uncompressed raw and processing to buggery and back i cant see any visible difference for my uses    honestly its really a dumb idea of sony to still have it  the benefits far outweigh the marginal negatives for 99 of photographers    but i guess that they dont want to patch real raw into their older bodies  almost all of their older models also offer raw      without knowing your requirements and intended use nobody can give you any credible answer      there are generally held good bokeh lenses and lists on google will give you most opinions similarly therere probably lenses which are held as having shit bokeh but obviously less people posting about them
the sony rx 100 is 368 on amazon and is recommended often should i buy one of those or wait to see if the gr2 goes on sale im not that big into photography id just like something compact with a large sensor that takes better photos than my phone while not raping my wallet
my friend is looking for a new camera but shes unsure between the d3500 vs d5300    which one would you guys advise for
  if shes unsure d3500     unless she wants it to take naked selfies in which case the flippy screen on the d5300 will be invaluable
dumb idiot here    if im only going to be shooting in good light during my travels a rx100 iv will produce roughly the same iq as an a7 or a6300 with a cheap lens right
  no    a ff sensor is twice as forgiving on a lens as crop let alone 9 times as forgiving of a 1 sensor even the cheapest of shit russian lenses will be much sharper and of course you get 9 times better low light performance too
  so the a7 with its kit lens will produce better images than a rx100 iv
    in all cases  is there some gallery where i can compare them flickr sucks
  in faststone you can just open image and hover mouse to the right and itll open exif
is there some international online shop that lets me print my photos on canvas dirt cheap
  get an rx100 iii at the minimum second hand if you need to if you cant afford it then either save up or get something else      potentially it depends on just how bad the lens is on the other cameras and the maximum aperture an a6x00 or a7 will always have better image quality than the rx100 at base iso but as the iso increases there becomes a point when the rx100 can match it noise and dynamic range so if you stick a slow enough lens on them then you can end up with very similar images    in lighting conditions bright enough that even with a slow kit lens the a7 and a6x000 are still at low isos then they will always be better but its not like the rx100 will be bad its actually in lower lighting conditions when they can be comparable again when the lens on the bigger cameras are slow enough or perhaps dont have is like the rx100 has
  sony rx 100 is 368 on amazon and is recommended often  recommended often  citation needed    its controls and battery life is quite appaling even for point and shoot standards      sonyshill shilling for a week old post youve not shot astro youd notice sonystars if you did youre just lying sony bitch
  its controls and battery life is quite appaling even for point and shoot standards  i take it youve never actually used one battery life varies quite a lot depending on which particular model youre looking at with ii being the best and v the worst but theyre comparable to other 1 compacts controls are also very good considering their size there arent as many physical controls as some of the bigger alternatives but theres a shit load of customisation meaning its easy to access the stuff that you actually need
  i own it battery life is bad for one reason it extends the lens as soon as you turn it on a shit ton of electricity gets lost there if you just start it up and start shooting youll get a decent amount of shots but in rl scenario where you turn it on every now and then itll be appalling and the controlls are shit i mean seriously whoever designed that circular shit in place of a controll cross should be shot
  turning a dial is better that repeatedly tapping a button although again i wonder if you really have actually used one because if you had you would know that it also functions as a directional pad
    in that case are there any good pointandshoot cameras youd recommend an a6000 is about the same price but i heard it suffers from a bad lens which sort of gimps images from the getgo
  the kit lenses are okay not the best obviously  for the price you get the body the included 1650 and 55210 i wasnt complaining    luckily my flatmate has a bunch of old om mount lenses so gonna grab an adapter and have a whale of a time
  how else would i know that it turns
  because it looks like a wheel/dial but it is also a 4 direction dpad

will my 550d from 2010 with almost twice the sensor size of a rx100 iii give me prettier pictures if i buy it a new fancy lens for the rx100s price only have the 550d kit lens atm
  dxo scores say the rx100iii has higher colour depth and dynamic range but worse low light performance because no shit its a 1 sensor of course it looks bad when you crank the iso    so i guess ask yourself if you shoot low light a lot or if you are gonna want something longer or wider than the 2470 youll be stuck with on the sony
  thanks and a good lens for my 2010 550d costs almost the same as the rx100iv anyway

  rx100 iii or newer small enough to easily slide into trouser pockets and can produce images significantly better than any phone today and for years to come
i want to print my digital photos can anyone recommend a color printer  a photo paper brand that is the right balance between not terribly expensive and not terrible quality
know nothing here i dont own a camera  will i look like an autist if i use a point and shoot camera   i was considering getting a nicer phone with a better camera but thats too expensive for me right now  i dont want a dslr was looking into point and shoots    this looks decent to me is it decent for the price  
  theres a difference between a point and shoot and a compact camera unless youre a yank that is a compact camera that has some point and shoot modes but it also has manual controls    unless you absolutely need that 30x zoom range go for something with a larger 1 sensor and less zoom range but a similar overall size something like the zs100/200 sony rx100 series preferably iii and newer canon g3/5/7/9 series if you do want that zoom range but dont need something small enough to slide into a pocket then theres the zs1000/2500 sony rx10 series and some of those canons have longer ranges
  those are slightly out of my budget but i will consider them for the sensor size youre right i dont think i need 30x zoom but some cameras like the g9 only have 3x zoom i do like the size though compared to the ones you listed that have zoom i will do more research but thank you for the recommendations
  lol you could just buy an actual monopod for like 5 more dollars
i want to buy some used lenses from usedphotopro and keh cameras do you guys have any experience with them how much time will they take to deliver to florida im inna hurry have to leave town on dec 10
  ive bought shit tons of gear from keh almost always a good experience and the few times theyve sent me something broken the return/replace was quick and painless i wholeheartedly recommend them
is my old 550d about as good or better than a rx100 iv
  with its kit lens  for stills
  get a better lens the canon kit one is dog shit
  any half decent one is the price of a new compact rx100 with about the same or better iq    no
    no the lens is worse sensor dynamic range is very similar noise performance is worse resolution is lower
  so its not worth it upgrading its kit lens
  if thats gonna be your only lens then no even if you got a constant f/28 zoom thats no where near fast enough to make up for the worse noise performance even more so at the wider focal lengths where the rx100 goes as fast as f/18 over a stop faster
  save yourself a bunch of money and get either the 50mm f/18 or 24mm f/28 pancake if you want something smaller/wider you wont regret it
  is there really this much of a difference holy shit    still im not sure whether i should buy new lenses for such an old house
  keh rules dont be afraid of bargain condition things there either  theyre almost always within the top mint exc a condition bracket youd see on ebay
  do it

  and of course you get 9 times better low light performance  why do you bring up low light performance when he said hes shooting in good light    did you not understand his question

  that shot works for me i think the only improvement i see is that you should have turned the label a little bit more so you can easily read everything

  sick i love the way her eyes are lit i cant put my finger on it but theres also something very pleasing about her lips      simple but very cool i only wish the wings were focused better to get all that detail      hm not in love with it for some reason i think its because the surroundings look unpleasant the doge is cute of course but the worn out tarp trampled grass and cage are all sort of unhappy symbols      cute looks very professional i hope they paid handsomely      really diggin these colors cant decide if the lonely street corner makes me feel comfy or creepy but i like it      i like what im seeing but personally i feel like theres a fight between the valley in the background and the gun in the front it seems like the photo is really supposed to be about the gun but the way its framed doesnt really communicate that      very fair question i liked the ambience behind this building the lighting was hard and there were all these pipes and various machinery attached to the wall that cast some pretty neat shadows the entire building was painted pink and white which i thought was uncharacteristically dainty given the somewhat grimy surroundings tried to capture all that in the pic    in fact there was another fixture on the wall that i would rather have posted but somebody parked in front of it right as i was going to shoot
  veeeery nice normally id say the subject is doing all the work here muh cool sportz car but honestly the composition stands on its own      also pretty good      meh the other two are way better

  great subject awful execution         take like 3 steps forward so you dont have half a tree blocking your foreground           lol this photo is like 80 cleavage by volume        checkd on those trips also love the tones
  yes but it doesnt depend on it to be a good photo
    i assume youre talking about the half tree     yes it does its sloppy and illexecuted to have your foreground interjected by something that doesnt contribute to the photo
  ill be more impressed when its a wild polar bear and not some canned photoshoot in a safari
    that is a wild polar bear
  thanks for the feedback do you mean because of the tree that appears on the side you are right
    yeah the tree on the left step forward a bit so its out of the frame and everything will be much cleaner and more aesthetic

  cars on the right are drawing the eye badly other than that maybe a bit too much foreground and no harm in correcting perspective to get the building on the left straight
  10 for atmospherics try some different crops foreground is bugging me but it might be better to darken it rather than remove it    invert this branches need to be at the bottom open sky at the top nice
  idk how you do those macro shots but thats awesome    the fender and right side should be a bit brighter but overall i love it    a bit closer would have been perfect besides that still a pretty pic plus doggos    i cant place if its the lighting or the white balance or shadows but something is off i would have taken the pic in either lower or closer to noon against what everyone says because the statues shadow creation is what makes them amazing    if the barrel was opposed against the snow or something it would look better but thats just my autism and i dont like subjects bleeding into the background like the car pic i mentioned    anyways here you go have at it some prick who cant handle his alcohol    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce7m2camera softwareilce7m2 v400maximum lens aperturef/18focal length 35mm equiv55 mmimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution350 dpivertical resolution350 dpiimage created20181120 095415exposure time1/100 secfnumberf/22exposure programmanualiso speed rating4000brightness20 evexposure bias03 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length5500 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width1616image height1080renderingcustomexposure modemanualwhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal

  a complete lack of expression in all reality i was trying to time the second curtain flash and 30 second exposure so i was counting off the time in my head so that i could get in frame at the right time
  i like it composition is good and its well exposed for the sky also good use of flash

    first time using a point and shoot
what do yall think about the composition of this shot
  reminds me of this id kinda just like to see more of the subject
  get out of the habit of taking shots only from eye level standing
  would have liked a steeper angle to get that looking out and up thing it seems youre going for
  its not airbrushed as fuck she has amazing skin
    yeah if only there was some possible way to do something about that some sort of white balance feature on your camera or perhaps some sort of post processing feature on your computer
  thanks for the insight thats what i thought  may i ask the camera  but yeah great aesthetic on the photo in any way
  i personally like it it literally looks like that would you rather pretend it looked different

  cant even get feet in frame yet tries to give critiques
  it seems like you were focused on the building and didnt consider your placement centering yourself to the alley and crouching would have been the same building angle but better composition     snapshit     google the rule of thirds    not at all in focus    not bad at all   the only thing i could suggest would have been backing up and using a longer lense to make the photo flatter that close with a wide angle gives the perspective v shape and the building on the right looks like it slopes back rather than goes straight up a 200m and a few places back would really make this great

    i have alot more but didnt wanna clog the whole thread up i can post any if these if anyone is interested
  that treelike structure of the plants makes the cow seem gigantic its messing with my mind
sometimes i shoot food
                    these are somewhat artistically interestingthey manage to inch past the medium of photography towards the nebulous realm of actual art     the rest are either technically sufficient or plain not bueno
      any particular reason why theyre diptychs the first one is the most successful imo simply because there seems to be a connection between the models gaze and the tops of the trees i like her pose in the second one third is ok    each of the subjects in this one could be nice images unto themselves together i think theyre all dividing the viewers attention    the neatest things about this pic are all on the left side the right side seems insignificant by comparison    i agree with the others that her skin looks artificial even if it really isnt it definitely has that plastic look regardless it looks good overall maybe it couldve been zoomed a bit less so more of her is in the frame    animals are always coolespecially something like this which most of us dont see every day i wish you couldve gotten closer for a more creative angle/different perspective        i like all of these perhaps they arent all that challenging but the manmade lights create a cozy atmosphere    sorta its a cool sculpture but there isnt much else to say      first one is far better than the second her pose the warmth of the light the shadows the dead shrubberythey all add up to a captivating image second one looks like shes contemplating her walk of shame after she got drunk at a bonfire party and woke up in the deer stand    i like quite a few things about this the dark alley is ominous but that little slice of an ordinary day in the city adds some contrast and then this woman is she an unsuspecting victim or a perpetrator who has you cornered cool scene both ways                i like all of these for different reasons but this post is already too long to go into detail
  animals are always coolespecially something like this which most of us dont see every day i wish you couldve gotten closer for a more creative angle/different perspective    you mean like this    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce7rm3camera softwareadobe photoshop lightroom classic 80 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/28focal length 35mm equiv400 mmimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20181115 094911exposure time1/1600 secfnumberf/28exposure programmanualiso speed rating400lens aperturef/28brightness60 evexposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length40000 mmcolor space informationsrgbrenderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal

    really nice just keep an eye on your background verticals / horizontals 2nd one

    sugoi kawaii desu
  wow thanks
  ive been to this place that bird is fake and placed there for douchey photographers to cop shots
  subjects are great colours and images technically as well youre just not executing well they feel very shanpshitty subject in the center and snap you need to look up compositions to get on next level anways i like that shark the most colours on turtle on p5310462 appear to be brilliant as well would like to see it posted if you dont mind
  id like to see pa280081 p6250081 pa300459 and pb271023 pb240106 in the new rpt thread   or make your own    theres some potential but like   said the compositions are pretty snapshit   once youve got good composition figured out you can work on post processing for better colors and contrast  with subject in center of frame theres less room to work with keep in mind you want to give your animals somewhere to move to  and  theyre too crowded and picture just cuts off in this regard p5301465 p6250192 and pb240106 might have some potential
i went down to cairo ilthe moist crotch of illinoisto take pictures of its steady and dramatic decline    in  some anon said to me  kid are you blind or new colour science alone would give it away to anyone thats owned a camera for more than 3 months  so this thread is also something of a challenge i shot with both a canon 5d mark iii and a sony a7 ii each with their respective nifty fifties i picked the camera to shoot each picture with basically randomly see if you can guess which shot came from which camera based on color science
cairo was a vibrant bustling hub of industry around the time of the civil war when being at the confluence of two major rivers and three states was a big deal
their biggest industries were    1 being a good place for steamboats to stop  2 ferrying cars across the ohio and mississippi rivers    we dont use steamboats anymore and bridges were built
now theyre pretty much a ghost town like people still live there but there are probably more abandoned homes than occupied ones most of the businesses are shuttered and the two really big housing projects in the city apparently were shut down between the last time i visited and this time pic related
shameless eggleston ripoff not sure if this was left there when the apartment complex was shut down or if neighborhood kids left it there afterwards while playing in the abandoned area
briefly wondered if an abandonedlooking building i was driving towards was actually not abandoned because i saw a van parked outside got closer noticed the tires were all entirely flat and this was the windshield soooo yeah no
risked being swarmed by wasps to get this shot this was outside club elite which was so elite that it was entirely closed down the wasps were flagrantly ignoring the no loitering signs
rust belt photography
even the streetlamps look sad     the downtown historic district has seen a few small efforts at revitalization but they all look like attempts to smear increasingly lowbudget lipstick on an ever more and more ugly pig
ayers ills the iver
  i anticipated /p/s reaction and took this photo with exactly this in mind
street puppies
anyway i look forward to everyones guesses as to which photos were taken with which camera it should be super obvious to anyone thats owned a camera for more than three months as the anon from the sony thread stated
i had originally planned to also shoot with my d700 but i couldnt find my nikon nifty fifty and i decided that shooting with the 28mm i had on it would give away the game too easily on that one
  it wont be easy at all    people who are used to a7iii colours wont be able to recognize 7 ii colours  even canon cameras dont have consistent colours through the models
  what is the website can i check it out
  its dpreviews studio scene tool
  based on the tone and syntax of the comment thats prompted all this it was one particular anon and hes an unemployed mentally ill manchild with a severe case of the sonygger shills  hopefully i dont need to be more specific
op even a halfblind person can see that all these pictures where shot with a canon you may delete your stupid thread now
rust belt  urban decay  sony a7ii  mundane trivia about locale  this smells like a chosis thread
  you had plenty to work with but i think you may be lacking in the skill department these are uninspired snapshits
  chodesis had to sell his sony
  im very sorry op but youve just confirmed mindless gearfags cant shoot good pictures i see some opportunities in the shots but youre execution is worse than expected from a schoolgirl with iphone
  rust belt  southern il vs northern pa/ny  sony a7ii  and 5d3   chosis thread  i assure you its not i guess he and i just have similar styles in terms of photographic subjects not in terms of child molestation and weird scams        can you elaborate beyond these are bad
  no real composition harsh lighting boring subjects
  its image thread so props for that at least it never is my wasnt my wish to be overly critical but since you asked for it      whats the subject here lamplight takes a quarter of the pic and is off focus gem sign looks interesting subject and its placed fuck knows where the other sign has stupid shadows all over it and is cut in half    took me whole day to figure there are some birds there wall is well enough subject you somehow even lucked out on good sidelight for it but youve completely misaligned it      lame ass attempt at photography at least level your camera to the subject before pressing your shutter its the least you should do      unneedlessly top heavy both too wide and again extremely lazy you could take one of these locations work with it for fifteen minutes and find a good composition for it    spec lights on the bricks distracting from everything else but fuck me at least its properly aligned    hide gearthreads for december  focus on skill instead
  appreciate the feedback     level your camera  i had to shoot offangle otherwise i would be in the shot myselfas a shadow in cairo or a reflection in closed     also the main goal for both of those shots was as components of the seriescairo as a thread opener giving the name of the subject and also showing it choked with vines and cracks from neglect highlighting the themes and sorry were closed to again reinforce the theme of cairo as a ghost town especially with the abandoned motel its attached to reflected in the glass although in hindsight i shouldve given that some more dof to make that more clear     needlessly top heavy both too wide and again extremely lazy  those two were intended as a diptych with the compositions mirroring each other the bridge symbolizing cairos past as a transportation hub plus a good hook to talk about how the bridges totally fucked over the places ferrybased economy and the bunge north america shot showing what little industry cairo still has aside from liquor/lottery stores i deliberately framed them both bottom heavy like that for a few reasons 1 both of the subjects are long and flat 2 the ground in front of one was full of annoyingly distracting elements and in front of the other was really boring and 3 to get the nice sunset which has some symbolism to it with the sun metaphorically setting over the town additionally the diptych served my secondary thread goal in that one shot was taken with the canon and the other with the sony     took me whole day to figure there are some birds there  man im glad you noticed them eventually the five minutes i stood there focused on the wall yelling at the birds to fucking fly out of the fucking hole were not in vain    okay like 45 sec but it felt longer
  unneedlessly
    and please dont take that reply as meaning no fuck you im always right and your criticism is badi really do appreciate the critique i just wanted to give some of my thought process behind the shots so you understood i wasnt just firing my shutter randomly
i think you have a compositional mindset that is very tightly cropped for lack of better words     i dont really have a better idea of the place you visited after seeing these a photos an addition of human subjects is mandatory since this is an attempt on a societal decline also a landscape shot or two which wouldve given me even a basic idea of where you went googling cairo illinois gave me a better idea of the city than any of your photos did
  an addition of human subjects is mandatory  very true this was simply me feeling awkward interacting with people especially since you know given the reason i was there if i asked to take someones picture theyd be all oh whats it for and id have to be all a random internet troll said a mean thing to me and so i decided to drive my white ass down here to spend my entire day shooting how terrible your town is using camera gear worth probably six months of your salary    so yeah definitely a failure on my part     also a landscape shot or two which wouldve given me even a basic idea of where you went  also a good point    i think you have a compositional mindset that is very tightly cropped for lack of better words   true i tend to find detail shots more interesting both to take and to look at also there was an aspect of constraint from the secondary goal of comparing the two camerasive got a bag full of glass for the canon but only the nifty fifty for the sony granted ive also got an mc11 but i forgot to bring that along because im an idiot and was already an hour away from home before remembering it
  canon    sony    canon    sony    canon    canon    sony    canon    sony    sony    canon    canon    sony
      finally starts posting good shots  your processing is a bit low contrast but these are very solid compositions i liked the doggie as well
  9/13 scoring you 69 nice for a gentlemans c    care to take a guess on     and pic related
  mfw color science is real
  9/13 is a decent score for randomly guessing 9/13 is a bad score for assertion that color science will make it obvious what camera took what photo for anyone whos owned a camera for more than 3 months
  and please dont take that reply as meaning  no hard feelings i expect the same here if i thought you senseless gearmonger i wouldnt give you reasons at all and yeah i have to agree with another anon last bunch is honestly much better    this one i like particularity hands down the best in thread    im not getting into colour argument personally i think its possible to see difference between different cameras to be precise it usually has to be same subject shot at the same time lenses can affect colours as well so body isnt the only factor id bet the first one posted is canon but thats it
   personally i think its possible to see difference between different cameras to be precise it usually has to be same subject shot  yeah i took a few shots where its the same subject from the same spot with the same settings and i can usually see a difference between those but i dont think people can really look at a shot out of context and go oh yeah those are those sweet sony colors i like so much without being told beforehand whether its canon or sony or nikon or whatever     your guess on the first picture may help or may hurt my argument but im not gonna say because that would be giving away what the first answer is    lenses can affect colours as well  yeah thats another reason i was really hoping to find my nikon niftyfifty for this experimentf mount is the least common denominator for all of the cameras of course id probably be too lazy to actually deal with swapping it around like the eyeball in the perseus myth but i considered it
  im most familiar with skin skies and foliage not grass there was very little of those referrences for me in these shots and i mainly came to those conclusions from the highlight rolloff    considering i believe this was supposed to be a thread to prove i or anyone couldnt tell the difference between the 2 im more than happy with 70 correct and it puts me way outside the bell curve for chance      ill take a guess when im at my desk my phones got an odd profile
  considering i believe this was supposed to be a thread to prove i or anyone couldnt tell the difference between the 2  fair enough id be interested to know your confidence intervals for the answers you gave and how closely you had to look at them to make your determination i will admit that you did better than i was expecting so im certainly willing to accept that im wrong     in any case my actual main point was that color science isnt a big enough deal for it to guide your camera buying decisionsyoull get better pictures out of a camera with bad color science and good controls/ergonomics than from a camera with good color science and shitty frustrating controls especially given that good vs bad color science seems to be driven mainly by personal biases and you can make someone think a given photo has better or worse colors just as easily by editing the exif as you can editing the colors
  about half were instant half i had a ponder over the quickest giveaway is that skies on most sony sensors tend towards green/cyan as thats the actual colour of the sky whereas canon its usually a slightly reddish blue and closer to the true blue that most of us picture a summer sky as canon tend to go towards quality of life tweaks over objective accuracy warm skin soft highlight rolloff soft blacks low microcontrast very blue skies etc pentax do a similar trick with their sky blues even though they use a sony sensor but their big giveaway is prioritising colour over luminance giving an almost oversaturated tonemapped look     to a point i agree that colour science alone doesnt make a camera good or bad however there is a definite difference between brands and once you have shot for long enough those differences become almost second nature and when you hit this point as a professional that needs to keep consistency you have 2 options tie yourself to one brand forever or use a colour profile card i go for the latter its 70 and means i can apply the same presets and curves to my pro ff camera and my smartphone and dynamic range allowing they should look largely identical
  i refuse to accept that some sonygger can tell the difference between 2 cameras like this and its clear that youve just set this whole thread up yourself    pathetic
  a lot of /p/ are autistic about the camera you used for an image though doesnt surprise me that someone would sit and guess if an image was taken with a canon or a sony its peak gearfaggotry but not uncommon around here
  if i the op and that guy the guy who guessed were the same guy why would  1 i guess a score of only 69  2 i post a response suggesting that 69 wasnt the greatest score    are you trolling or are you really so paranoid as to see a conspiracy here
  i went to school in carbondale im surprised you made it out of cairo alive
  eh i spend a lot of time taking pictures in north st louis and east st louis and havent had any issues cairo was like that but with fewer actual humans around     im sure ill think differently when i actually do get mugged or ill just die while trying to keep the mugger from stealing my camera

reminder use the shill thread for bullshit like this
i dont own one but we had one at my shop i used quite a bit it is a beautiful camera to shoot hands down the best camera fuji ever made i wish their digi shit lived up to the xpan
  the pano aspect itselft isnt at fault if the users use it because they are after a specific look depicting space then good for them  its the wow pano means cinematic crowd that are obnoxious
fucking gear thread shits
  this x100
  panorama is a gimmick
  your moms a gimmick
if you arent shooting at least 6x14 you probably arent in to panoramas and a meme hasselblad fuji rebrand camera isnt going to fix that
biggest hipster meme 2018  not this
  thanks for that missed it entirely love how they literally fit a piece of heavy metal inside just to make it feel hq hahahaha    also   checkem
  no u
  biggest hipster meme 2018  nope just some chink shit everyone hates nothing to see here
  no the x100 is a different camera
  this times 100 retard
film is a hipster meme    no fucking shit welcome to 2015
  dont get the point of this thing either use a view camera with a 6x12 or 6x17 back or something dedicated to medium format panoramas this doesnt really even meet medium format quality also youll end up using tripods 90 of the time anyways so might as well use a larger camera
  cinematic aspect ratio is a meme
  but muhhhh cinematic street snapshits
  medium format quality is a meme and 95 of people shooting it arent scanning it well enough to achieve any quality beyond a lab scanned 35mm frame fuji and noritsu lab scanners literally scan 35mm at a higher resolution than 120 because of the way the ccds are designed physically and most people arent paying 50 per neg to use prepress flatbeds or drum scanners to scan their snapshits not to mention the resolving limitations of the shitty 50 year old glass youre limited to when you invest in a medium format system     medium format is a status signal for hipster film nerds that think theyre not analog enough by shooting 35mm the next step being large format but luckily that is too autistic even for most film dorks     there is a reason none of the new kodak film stocks are coming out in 120 120 will be lucky to exist in 5 years
  this is probably bait good job almost rebutted this garbage post
    its a pretty hot take but its mostly true  if high quality scanning was more accessible to plebs it might be a different story  i can get awesome results from medium format with stitched dslr scans but even i feel like its too much trouble most of the time considering the quality i can get out of carefully shot 35mm using modern glass and films scanned with the same setup    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce7camera softwaregimp 2814maximum lens aperturef/10focal length 35mm equiv0 mmimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20180814 075050exposure time1/125 secfnumberf/00exposure programmanualiso speed rating100brightness72 evexposure bias0 evmetering modecenter weighted averagelight sourceotherflashno flash compulsoryfocal length000 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width1500image height2250renderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balancemanualscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnesssoft
  its definitely a hot take    a few things the look of mf is just different regardless of scan quality also its not too difficult to get a great mf scan and when you do it absolutely blows away 35mm    re glass lenses have progressed sure but not to the point where more recent 120 systems like blad bronica and fuji are anywhere near obsolete    so youre only partially wrong
  this times 100 retard  he understood that he was making a joke you have made yourself look like a fool
  dont get the point of this thing  its a 35mm rangefinder with the size and usability benefits that come with that over say a view camera or medium format panoramic camera that shoots in a panoramic aspect ratio unlike most 35mm panoramic cameras it actually shoots the full width of the 35mm film strip instead of just cropping a 24x36 frame down so not really medium format quality but you get legit 35mm quality across a longer frame size    it makes for a great street photography camera changing the aspect ratio changes the way you view the world and that lets you get different pictures than people shooting regular 23 aspect ratios
  people could not even tell from the trailer that its a plastic toy
  thing is most people dont use a dedicated film scanner even for 35mm  in that case the difference in resolution and graininess is pretty noticeable between 35mm and medium format when scanned with a flatbed    also you forget printing  medium format can print big and smooth/brainless and enlargers are cheap    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makeepsoncamera modelperfection v800/v850camera softwaresilverfast 880 r10 aug 23 2017  29aff80 2308imagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpicolor space informationsrgbimage width1021image height1000scene capture typestandard
  brainless  grainless  that freudian slip
  no film is a meme and this camera is the flavour of the month of that meme
  he didnt just buy a 645 or 6x6 with a 135w film back
  i shoot mf because i enjoy my pictures on my wall the difference in a big print between 35mm and 120 is just something you have to see for yourself    higher iso film as 120 is just so much cleaner too as the size of th grain stays the same but the actual film area is larger
  thatd give a pano of 24x56 instead of 24x 65
  i bet you couldnt even tell the difference
  guestion why do 120 frames have those overhanging corners
  its from the mask at the film back to create a square image on the film and also leave some space on top and bottom for the film markings type frame number etc  why they didnt make it a perfect square i dont know maybe its easier to manufacture this way and since it doesnt affect the image they just let it be this way    its not supposed to be in the final photo though i just didnt get to editing those shots yet i only run them through a resize script
  may sound weird but is there a way to expand the film back corners to get full coverage of the film kind of like a sprocket film camera
  yeah if youre ok with filing down the mask at the back  you dont get much space though less than in 35mm it any cool effect cause there are no sprocket holes
  uh thats a 9mm 3/8 difference on the film youd have to be blinded to not see the difference     its the same difference between a 6x6 frame and a 6x7 frame you knob
  not using 6x7 with 35mm in 220 back
  just because people are too lazy to do the scanning work doesnt mean medium format quality is in any way less  everyone can get their own drum scanner for around a thousand dollar these days if you arent scanning your own film it is a meme for sure if all one does is shoot film send it to a lab and then post it to instagram there is no discernable difference over shooting digital to me aside from the different camera system
    not buying a gw690 and using a 35mm adapter
  there is no discernable difference over shooting digital  well the difference is that their wb focus and exposure is usually fucked and they can just accept it as the aesthetic because they think that film makes photography unpredictable and lomo  and people who shoot film with technical competence are so few and far between that that assumption is never challenged so they still get treated like special snowflakes for doing a shit job    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce7camera softwaregimp 2814maximum lens aperturef/10focal length 35mm equiv0 mmimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20180410 193723exposure time1/125 secfnumberf/00exposure programmanualiso speed rating100brightness72 evexposure bias0 evmetering modecenter weighted averagelight sourceotherflashno flash compulsoryfocal length000 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width1080image height735renderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balancemanualscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnesssoft
  i like your shot anon
  xpan isnt a normal film camera it shoots 2 frames at once so it looks like a movie
  120 is really only better if you are home scanning
  120 is better if you are doing home scanning
  how do people fuck up the focus on film just line up the split prism and shoot with a wide lens with a narrow f stop
  bruh i know what an xpan is of course its a hipster meme    all film cameras are hipster memes hence the xpan is one too    all squares are rectangles
  prism i just use the auto focus on my f100 its so weird how film is synonymous with shitty vintage cameras with no features for so many people auto focus has been around since the fucking 80s
  thats not how widescreen in movies works those almost always use anamorphic lenses that have a very particular kind of look
      he doesnt own a 9000    pathetic
  why would you fuck focus with an autofocus camera
  coolscan thats cute i guess thats good if youre just starting out but im a little deeper in the scanning game id never pay the ridiculous hipster tax for a consumer level scanner like the coolscan that can only do 35mm and 120 especially considering the fucked colors the coolscans turn out     i use a scanner youve probably never heard of and id rather not namedrop because the prices are still really good on them and id like to buy another but were talking 8x10 at true 6000dpi

  so can you still find drivers for your shit old umax  do you have issues with scsi  do you have to run a powermac g4 as well
does anybody know what the russian/ussr lens was that didnt use any conventional optics it used mirrors in order to create an image
google mirror lens and use the gear thread please
  this is a highly specialized lens its not about gear more about engineering also i have looked it up its not helpful and you arent either
  you got your answer anon youre just being stubborn    it is called mirror lens like the ones used in telescopes theyre not exclusive to russia but the russians have been known to churn out some pretty damn good examples like the mto lenses    theyre cool because they allow insane focal lenghts in very short bodies but theyre also dark as fug unless theyre gigantic and they create that horrible donut shaped bokeh
  no you diidnt read the question this russian/ussr lens doesnt use conventional optical elements like lenses it only uses mirrors in order to form an image youre being both adversarial and useless and will not be receiving any more replies from me
  this was a stupid thread to make op at least include more context to it who it could of been made by what purpose for military or space shit you gave us jack shit not like youre gonna buy the lens or make one you should of asked this in a actual thread you bumped off another thread for this stupidity

  most mirror lenses also use a glass optic at the rear exit some at the front as well
  the front glass does nothing the rear glass does nothing optically either
  wow a premium mirror lens can have optics guess that means they all have optics
op here nobody has brought up the lens yet its one of those lenses you either know about or dont hopefully i can stir something in someone to remember what it is its boxy and has cyrillic on the outside of it

  this isnt it thanks though it uses no lenses only mirrors its kind of an open design on the front too i think the front mirror is at 45

  i sometimes watch manny ortiz
im still waiting for lok to call out the eos r for its horrendous rolling shutter    it seemed to be a massive issue to him back in the day but he doesnt care about that problem anymore for some reason
  tony isnt that bad    he is just using especially harsh wording which can seem excessive to some people  like when he claims the slt mirror steals 1/3rd of the image quality it bothers some people  or like when he claims apsc has half the image quality of ff that bothered even more people    in the end its just about how you package your words and he seemed to have picked up a particular way that makes people angry

  off topic thread    this isnt your photos and theres nothing about gear
mango street is my top pick from this list they are quite creative and their information videos are quick and nicely presented heaton is nice for /out/ and the rest of these are basically gear news which is ok but not very photo related for gear chris and jordan is best sean tucker and tommy reynolds which sean linked to are quite nice mattias burling is asmr and a fellow swede but sometimes he feels a bit too stubborn to vouch for nonpopular stuff just because he wants to go against the grain    more analog centric 1 eduardopavez negative feedback analog insights matt day eye culture magazine few videos but a nice vibe
    what is wrong with this dude his body literally freaks me out a bit
i like scott kelby the most out of those choices but hes definitely a gearfag and loves to shill random conventions that only upper middle class  rich people can afford to go to     his photo critiques are good to watch though
  not that guy but ive definitely seen them publishing articles that push leftist ideals like stuff about how to succeed as a female and/or black photographer in a white male dominated industry subtle implications that trump rallies are small and that hes unpopular benign stuff like that its just minor stuff that makes you kinda roll your eyes
  
  are we rating them for their entertainment value teaching ability their actual photographic ability    kais autistic ass is probably the most fun to watch his photos are the kind of boring shit youd find in the /rpt/ though his gear review from his time at digitalrev does a decent job showing off gear that you might be interested in    lok is like kai minus the charisma charm entertainment value or any of the things that makes kai entertaining    northrups are dogshit in everything they do their photo critiques are like a hugbox bullshit that doesnt give any real critique just asspats for mediocrity their photos are fucking shit their the type of people who try to be a jack of all trades type instead of specializing in one genre of photography and it shows     ted forbes spews out worthless platitudes about creativity and artistry and tries to paint himself as some sort of hipster intellectual but his photos are boring as shit so clearly he doesnt follow any of his own advice    peter mckinnon is extremely good at documenting the life of his favorite person in the world peter mckinnon his channel is more or less like a reality show about his life than any sort educational resource for anything photography related    fstroppers is okay their critique show has infinitely more substance than the northrups not that thats saying much they have some great content except most of their best stuff is hidden behind a pay wall    jared polin has some good photos mixed in with some shit photos hes basically like a guy who shoots so much that hes pretty much guaranteed to find a few good photos in the trash heap hes shit at teaching though and provides little to no value to anyone
  theyre just so cute together
  the better questions are  why do you follow pretentious ecelebs  who really cares about them  why are you not out shooting over paying attention to these twits  hell l do not even know who these people are nor do l care about the only one l have seen is the one azn dude but he was only mildly amusing once then it all seemed like the same crap    does she do it topless because if not she is not all that cute  also l snagged some nice vintage gear at an estate sale for a pornographically low price i should make a nice thread about it to piss some people off
  his photos are the kind of boring shit youd find in the /rpt/ though    what is rpt
    lol look at those pearly yellows on angry photographer
    the fact you have scott kelby as a who even tells me a lot about your level of photography experience
  negative feedbacks not there i still feel hip
    youll like this
  /yawn    wow sure fun watching some guy paint low grade timber black and then some cactus prints
  wheres negative feedback bestest  yeah theres fro knows photos worstest
  hes the most annoying gear fan no ability or taste in the whole picturetaking point of it all
  god jordan is annoying    this camera is great for video   except it doesnt have 1242 18bit n log c out capabilities  but its not all bad the cfdpaf is excellent with smooth pulls  but the downside is there is not 12bit with afc  and that just wont work for us z log shooters  its just unacceptable insert manufacturer
  kai is the best simply because he doesnt pretend to be serious fuck all those hacks theyre good at being celebs not at being photographers
i like 
  this
  you have to shoot photos all day and night  cant have any entertainment related to photography
  the problem is that theyre hacks  if you wanted entertainment related to photography theres tons of better choices you could watch spiderman for example

  ian wong is based
  how dare a professional have strict requirements
  go to the catalog newfriend  look for the   recent photo thread  aka  that anons saying that kais little better than /p/s average
how do you people watch this shit
  makes yt videos with a gimbal  professional  using stills cameras
  scott kelby and his company run clinics and workshops all over the country his teaching website hosts hundreds of hours of tutorials from dozens of famous photographers there is a lot of content and instructional information to be had there for all skill levels and so when you dont know who he is that does tell me a lot about your level of photography experience instead of being salty and butthurt about it maybe google him and improve yourself
  hey its the person always crying about racism  i saw you before
thomas heaton  nick carver   ben horne

    unironically using the term zoomer     i shiggity diggity
  777  sean tuucker not on the list
  isnt she just the model/mouthpiece
  of those art of photography     not on the list gerald undone
  kai is clearly /p/ personified  actually goes out and takes pictures  isnt afraid to shoot people from up close and generally act like a clown in public  nah
    if you read the article youd see that males were found to have a significant preference for masculine toys but females were found to be more open to both masculine and feminine toys
all of these anons reccomending negfed    unpopular opinion but its not my favorite analog channel his style of video is too predictable as to what you may expect of a channel that is exclusively on film gear and despite his photos being somewhat aesthetically pleasing george and his crew are bland in their presentation     so far there isnt a very solid allround channel dedicated to analog maybe im just yearning for the entertainment values presented by the long gone analogrev however theres been no real attempt at this sort of content by most other photographers thus far
      lol did anyone actually buy those prints they look boring
  i have videos on the background at work    i like her voice the models she has are cute toofucking australians
  he said he sold something at the event but it was a much nicer tree photo    the cactus things or whatever are lame and flat
  watch the video of his shootout with jason lanier its immediately obvious that even with a medium format camera the fat fuck cant even take halfdecent photos jason lanier blew him out the water    
  seems to know a lot of hot girls jelly
  but females were found to be more open to both masculine and feminine toys  not in the human test group the tomboys were the rare variety like 37 versus 63    the homosexual who wanted to hug a doll barely exists in comparison hence the mens brain is the mens brain liking cameras and cars and tech stuff is a male thing
  kai too bad kai lok and alamby all left digitalrev
  i dont care what those gearfags shoot i was asking if you could back that stuff about how he has taken advantage of an old woman to take her house because this is not the first time i see you post this shit
    i wish i could eat alambys nose
scott kelby is the only semiprofessional person on there     fro is garbage
  art of photography  complains about gearfaggotry  channel is filled with gearfaggotry    i like fstoppers because im a mindless drone who cant distinguish bad photos from good ones and i like two white dudes and a community telling me what is good and what isnt
  too bad kai left digitalrev  its actually good kai doesnt smash expensive gear on the concrete anymore
  that channel is dodgy af girls are always uncomfortable mark said mark has mark wants shitty props no composition expecting metoo
  accurate af
  eduardopavez  ed is totally talented imho but all his lomo shilling annoys me and is a waste of time
kai he reminds me of clarkson
  dave marrow  ben horne are probably my favorite landscape photographers on youtube i dont really care for gear fag reviewers unless its chelsea  her big fat ass what a fucking babe
  second this    that crazy canadian bastard makes me laugh
  f2m tranny
  post chels booty
  why arent any of em black
  why do you only see people as skin tones
  i cant think of a famous a black photographer other than that guy with the crown graphic that stands out front of bh in new york some people say that the camera doesnt even work or have film in it    and i sure cant remember ever seeing a black photo youtuber
    ade torrent aka old cameras on youtube  
  thanks for the recc
    this guy is half black i think     
  
  they all look jewish
  fuck that hype beast tread riding faggot i dont hate many youtubers but he sure is one of them just get a load of his about page  kingjvpes is an analog photography website/blog but is also a youtube channel content is always related to film photography and the art behind it sharing information to new and seasoned veterans to keep the love for film photography alive and going filmisnotdead  my name jonathan paragas creator if kingjvpes my love for analog photography started is fueled by a passion for street photography something about the two go hand in hand and the purity of seeing an image and then using your own two hands to mix chemistry and make an image is pure magic film being a dying art one of my main goals with kingjvpes is to expand and recover the lost art being 20 years old part of my life was shot mostly all on film then it disappeared i want to be a part of the resurgence and hopefully we can bring film back to life
  holy fucking shit massive cringe
  jared fucking polin
  any recommendations for a camera site/community that focuses purely on photography and not unrelated sociopolitical bullshit other than /p/
    kai and lok look jewish u wot     makes sense though jews have money and photography aint cheap same reason you aint see no black photogs black folks creative outlet is rap because all you need is a voice
  no ass shots shes no lewd insta whore our girl
  no good photos  only gearfagging   boomers fapping material   autistic   yeah definitely gearfags /ourgirl/
    her nose is disgusting she would be okay if you put a bag over her face but that nose seriously creeps me the fuck out
  seen half of them all are awfull no real information just some studio test nobody from them take a camera and shoot with it month they pressing buttons in studio and talking how do the feel about it     nothing but entertaining content
  they pressing buttons in studio and talking how do the feel about it    what kai and lok shoot all their shit on the street
  legggggssssss
  autistic    is this the only way to find a woman with a decent personality
  decent  all women are stupid  wtf youre talking about
  i said personality not judgement
  disgusting how this guy puts himself in front of a fucking camera very disrespectful
  i love it when she utters the words iphone x it really hits the sweet spot    whats the matter pussy intimidated by a dominant nose
  women   personality        whats the matter pussy intimidated by a dominant nose  it looks like she fucks black guys
  what are you even trying to say
  came here to say this
  teeny harris
    there really is not good hybrid of education and photovideo bhphotovideo has a decent event series as does adorama there are people out there who teach meaningful analog/lf things but they generally lack when it comes to production value ie fred newman excellent material but watching his videos is like wiping your ass with sandpaper the closest i have seen to someone merging these two things is probably ted at theartofphotography some people try to merge these things but their output comes off a little hokey ian wong is a good example maybe someone like graintv is another most people just shill gear and add nothing unfortunately        epg has some interesting stuff but his shots are a little boring imo i feel like his production value is much better than his ability to make photos also it doesnt hurt that his old lady is a designer
  dawoud bey
  whats funny is /p/ has had better photographers and advisors than everyone on that list
    im sure her husband loves watching her fuck strong dominant black men dude seems like a big cuck
  none of them have the testicular fortitude to make a youtube channel so nobody cares
  the complete opposite actually a skinny white dude with grey hair
  testicular fortitude  tony northrup  ken wheeler  were you just pretending to be a retard
  it still takes guts to put yourself out like that to be judged by potentially millions of people even if you personally dont like the person doing it if some tripfaggot from /p/ made a youtube channel theyd probably do it while wearing a mask and using a voice changer it takes no guts to shitpost on 4chan skill or no skill thats why nobody cares about their work like people care about middle of the road youtubers
  burke amongst a few others has a youtube channel but the general public is attracted to gearfags so he/they didnt get popular    it takes no guts to shitpost on 4chan  tripfags consistently post their portfolios as opposed to 90 of youtubers  it takes guts to shill gear and form a fake eidentity  no anon its the skill of lying youre mistaking guts for privacy youre new so your delusion is understandable    thats why nobody cares about their work like people care about middle of the road youtubers  we live in a society
  im not new ive been on /p/ a long time and im just not deluded to how things work especially in the industry    most normal people dont really care a lot about photography they want to see how the image was taken step by step so they can imitate it what gear was used get to know the people behind the image personality content and most of all be entertained it has been that way since photography magazines were the norm youtube channels are just an updated version of what the industry learned with magazines    gearfag shit gets the clicks it even brings massive uptick in interest to /p/ see the massive influx of posting when the nikon z7 announcement happened youtube channels would be stupid to not cover gear as thats where the clicks are however plenty of channels dont cover gear and do well enough see thomas heaton and others like him its just hard for me to judge channels for going where people are most interested even if i dont care myself    lets face it alexs channel was never taken seriously even by him half of his videos are 1030 seconds long and its all produced like halfassed shit great photographer but hes not a great youtuber you can be great at one and bad at the other he didnt take off on youtube because his video content is garbage
  ken is such an annoying fuck its a shame hes the only one able to give good lens reviews on youtube  shit thread by the way
shit tier definitely ken rockwell

  dude ted has definitely shifted focus away from the art in the art of photography it makes sense considering the only way to make money on youtube is to become a glorified salesman but i hate that the majority of his videos now are clickbait titles and gear reviews
  this pic xd
  lmao but ed is an anarchist
no ian wong  no dpreview  literally ted forbes is the only decent content creator on that list and him only for his past videos
mattias burling  kai  only watch these for some humor and gear faggortry     oh and i imagine most of you look and have portfolios like jason lanier but with uglier models
what did youtube mean by this
  it meant that out of the many channels available on its popular video streaming service this one is recommended specially for you congratulations anon
  masculine toys so like dildos
  what a fuck is this photo about why is she in high heels in sexy pose on someones tomb
for ideas to shoot mango street  for gear reviews it has to be jared polin as much as he is a massive wanker    peter kai and fstoppers have interesting videos but very rarely informative     thomas heaton has some quality stuff for landscapes but good videos are too far apart     the whole second row are probably bottom of the barrel thanks tony but i can read a spec sheet myself without the apple and sony ads    gerald undone isnt listed but he has some great videos for both new photographers and those who care about learning more about the way gear actually works
  what is this meme where did it begin   or will /p/ fuck any woman pretending to be a photographer
  this guy gets it
    fstoppers the art of the photography matt granger jared polin and kai wong are the top tier photography channels they are not cringy and clickbaity like petermckinnon and tony  chelsea northrup
  desecrating random tombstones    fucking hell show some respect    also are tony and chelsea a couple or is tony her father the age gap seems massive considering tony has white old man hair and she looks like 25 or some shit
  best  thomas heaton also simon baxter    worst  the rest on your stupid pic    worst of the worst  i dunno its a tie between the northrups
  she looks like 25 or some shit  u wot
  lmao she looks above 40
  were they drunk
  dont be rayciss  4chan  anon i 
  peter buy my lightroom presets mcshillnon    pix related when you shilled so hard that even your retarded core fanbase turned against you so you had to make a followup video backtracking your old one
  hes a shill but you clearly didnt watch the videos
  i actually tried to but i instantly closed the tab when he said that he has been shooting with the canon eos 1dx mk2 for 45 years when the camera was released in 2016 no one especially not a fucking skinny basedbouy with cringy tattoos has 3 year early access for that shit hes a patholotical liar who has to one up everyone else in order to seem more interesting or something
kai is the worst fucking uninformative and useless piece of shit ever
  going to kai for an informative video
  thatsmyfetishjpg
    what the fuck is on his wall are those sex toys
    he absolutely is you can tell because white people turn red when theyve had a shit ton of alcohol
  chels poops in that room
  steamy creamy
  those are wall clams  actually a species of parasitic crustacean that can grow to large sizes in warm and humid conditions he probably hasnt tried to pry them off because of the spines which are laced with a powerfully hallucinogenic venom
  the northrups are legit retarded
dedicated career to gearfagging instead of taking pictures
who asmr here  
  same also the only one i can watch the same videos over and over again guy is technically talented in a way that produces decent outcomes
so is this chick huge or is jared tiny
  same height    its called a side walk    go outside sometime

  kill youself you freak
  nu fone hu dis
  his views on nikon lenses are good tho
  i was looking at this pic and i got a video notification from tony and chelsea uploading a new video xd
  he had said in one of his videos where he makes a huge ass print that he is 57  also is he a jew by any chance
  is he a jew  yes
  he has some balls to be a youtuber with that disgusting face and body
  tony has grey hair but smooth face     what do you guys think of the snapchick
  mango street  who  peter mckinnon  literal canon shill   jessica kielbassa  a woman lol  jared polin  opinionated jew asshole  art of geartography  wont stfu   angry at his dentist  absolutely trash tier moron and fuji shill  jason lanier  the same but for sony takes more pictures than angry retard though   the northrups  theyre trying but theyre very hateable   kai  cant really hate on kai desu  lok  learn english cunt  thomas heaton  do you really hate your wife or what still good shit   scott kelby  still alive  fstoppers  they youtube  last three  who
  this guy is autism incarnate hes decent to watch for sure
  nigga he doesnt pretend to be a great photographer he is well aware hes a tech speaker / nerd   theyre a great team and they dont lie
  also agreed sean tucker is great if youre into the philosophical side of things
  theyre still gearfags
  yee i like potato jet for vid shit
  luminous landscape mostly boomers though for real
  if you think sean tucker is a gearfag the truth is that every photographer is some sort of gearfag   tucker does drag on a bit sometimes but hes earnest and makes comfy videos   its free stop being so salty
  best lok and kai together  worst angry faggot
    mango street are a couple the girl is qt hippy girl maybe jews though
ctrlf jew  11 matches    god fucking damn it why are all of you so antisemitic go back to /pol/ and spread your butthurt thoughts instead of persecuting people just because they are jewish origin what have they done against you that are making you act like muslims
    negative feedback and sean tucker
  its quite over the top how jewish some stuff in photography is though bhphoto for example is a really nasty business not in small part due to their jewishness fro guy also acts like every possible stereotype
  which are laced with a powerfully hallucinogenic venom    are you serious
  what
  i always thought the husband was gay
  let me guess youre asian
    he just stores all his fat in his hips its very feminine thats why it looks so weird on a guy
for french speakers this guy is good on analogue photography
  i think it dropped a bit in quality since their move to dpreview but they are pretty entertaining the best episodes are the one where chris just takes pics without too much fluff he really has good chops see the nikon f4 video for example
  are you speaking of their employment practices
scott kelly is the only who is even semirespected in the industry     i wonder how many models jason lanier bangs with sonyshill money
    jared is short as hell
  he forgot mentioning wwii
  i have no problem with jordan except for his dead man stare  its unnerving  he manifests no expressions except for that one that seems frozen on his face forever  its some uncanny valley shit
  he would make a great trap
is /p/ee not acquainted with the bob ross of the darkroom    
    this lad seems rad
  no david thorpe  no james popsys  no christopher frost    what are you doing with your life
  david thorpe  m43 gearfag    james popsys  generic as fuck    christopher frost  hes about as entertaining as the test charts he uses
  mattias burling tend to be very lenient with everything that isnt utter thrash
    does literally anyone actually speak with any eloquence about their process or experiences    since most of them are gearshilling shysters i assume not very often but someone who can also talk about the way their processes and perspectives have shifted over time would be boon especially as youtube enters its adolescent years    anyone have any good recommendations more in that area
    of course lanier did better but for the record they both are mad suckass photographers lol
polin is a self centered self cucker but has some good advice but is an applefag  i watch northrups party because id fuck up that bitch and then watch the cuck talk pc tech
best peter gregg    worst angry photographer that guy is toxic
  anybody pretending to be a woman would probably suffice
  toxic    can you use a human language to describe things if you think hes an asshole call him an asshole a fat blob with annoying voice a badly mutated miss piggy whatever     communicate in a human language you fagduke
  how many languages do you speak fluently     kys faggot
  nick exposed e6 vlogs shoot film like a boss cringe name i know nick carver old cameras matt day leftie mexican guy etc    they all shoot film but since its a dead technology that kind of lends itself to slightly less gear shilling and more discussion of process and technique     all these popular idiots in op have become unwatchable in the past year or two most of them were unwatchable to begin with
  jared is literally buy my presets not peter
  this
  thanks
  hello rddit
  mike janik is my boy
  also is that a fucking mamiya 5 panel what the hell

    nick carter is a singer not a photographer anon
  youre thinking of nick cave nick carter was the 39th president of the united states

  i like bw boomify i havent found much use for the others     i do like manny ortizs presets and his free frequency separation action for ps is handy
    this guy is such a fucking clout chaser hes literally jumping on any instagram/youtube photog fad and just doing exactly what everyone else is doing not to mention all the shitty dubstep he has in all his videos
  pushing leftist ideals  like equality  wew lad
  jp more informative than kai  nigga what
  kai is hit or miss sometimes he writes out some very good detailed pieces that really give great feeling to the gear he reviews other times hes just being a bit of an awkward nerd
  hello my friend i heard youre looking for  yes she does makeup shoots maternity shoots and bodypainting shoots shes a resident of baltimore my home and current city so i always feel the need to push for my local photographers and i do like her maternity/bodypainting shots shes also hot as fuck
  man who is this guy im loving it  skip to random spots in video  girl holding umbrella over due while he shoots  dont leave dogs in a hot car  inane old man mumbling  girl reading a magazine  more umbrella  hawaiian shirt    i have the impression that he probably knows a ton about the craft but you have to listen to him go on for 55 min to get that 5 min nugget of info

any of these folks decent at street photography
    kai is pretty good
theyre all terribad
is 32 a meme being forced on dslrs  43 looks better when shot vertically imo
  32 is the most efficient use of the image circle and sensor wafer combo
  most efficient use
  depends on how you want to frame and what you frame or what kind of mood you want to translate narrow frames for example can be felt as claustrophobic etc  landscapes like mountains often look better in a wide ratio imo same for anything that is supposed to look more cinematic 2391 etc    for vertical i go with you 43 looks better 32 looks kind of too narrow more over for portrait    annoying thing with shooting in another aspect ratios than 32 is you have to theoretically use crop factors like when shooting aspc recalculating your focal lengths and fstops if you want it in ff equiv
  geometry says that of all rectangular frames 11 gives you both the most use of image circle and the least wasted space on a round wafer
  32 came from the 35mm film era 35mm was a poor mans photography and 32 a compromise but it stayed and proved it worth 43 is widely considered the most natural aspect then again its all down to what you do with it when framing aspects should be adapted and considered beforehand even going from 32 to 43 is quite major step there is a ton of theory and written on both aspects from psychological mental to practical side of things  personally im getting drawn to even more squarish aspects rations that originated in large format film photography 45 1114 in that way 43 is more beneficial as it requires less cropping
i like 54 it works for me for digital its legit who cares you either get 32 or 43 depending on what is sold at your given sensor size crop however you like since you have no practical freedom in format choice
  54 is for portraits  unless you want that cleavage  43 looks like an old tv movie
after having to crop 169 for so many clients web banners ive grown to like this ratio
who /219/ here
      just get a film camera m43 and 645 both shoot in 43 xpan shoots in 271 66 is of course 11 and 612 is 21
11 is god tier stop relying on your art school design crutches
  43 in film era was half frame format it came after 35mm film was already established medium its half frame name came from nearly halving 35mm but since it also gave you 43 aspect ratio it was called that as well the point about 35mm being called peasant format comes from earlier point in history
problem with going from 32 to 43 is when you shoot through ovf  in live view you can make your view 43 in the live view options and frame according to this ratio  you cant reduce a 32 ovf to 43  the same thing is when shooting raw you have to crop it in post
  stop relying on your art school design crutches    who even knows what the fuck this is supposed to mean
  645 medium format is also 43 aspect ratio granted the olympus pen cameras came out in the 1960s and i dont know of a 645 camera made before the pentax 645 in 1984      he shoots a camera with an ovf   what a fag
im in love with the academy ratio 13751 and crop most of my photos that way the rest is cropped to square    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpicolor space informationsrgbimage width1000image height749scene capture typestandard

  wides are utter shit for stills photography theyre goat moving format
  i disagree for large format prints they are very nice
  could you point to some of this theory literature sounds interesting
  there are exceptions but generally speaking i believe it true wide format works in cinema really well since its different medium viewers focus stays fixed on the subject while scene continues around him extra space is giving great proportion to the frame at the same time eye wont follow it and notice constraints and inconsistencies the opposite is true for photographs eye will quickly find the subject then it will wonder around the scene usually in clockwise direction and it will appear cramped often directionless  soldiers in mud above is actually a very good example of this as still image you quickly shift gaze from captivating subject to the unfortunately captured objects on the left then to the strip of marking tape on the right you go back at the subject eventually and observe details and expression but you are aware of the defects around it and it spoils you your experience as photography it simply isnt working it could work by cropping it and erasing few distractions    you often find this in art theory literature rudolf arnheims art and visual perception is pivotal work in the field i know of no precise work regarding framing specifically for photography but it is often alluded to by michael freeman in his popular science opus once you start putting attention to frames of the images themselves as opposed to just finding subject and light you quickly realize how important they can be
  much appreciated dear anon my own research never leads anywhere near art theory so this should a handy start
  while i agree on disturbing backgrounds can remove the attention form the subject the ting is that background is very important for context if i where to crop the subject in the picture it would become more unintresting you can see this on alot of fan hos pictures sure he does not use 221 but with the use of dof he places his subject inside a scene    see example
      shit ton of old folders shoot both 645 and 6x6 i have an old east german one that does it with a mask and its probably from the 50s    i like 43 and 54 but mostly shoot 32 which i especially like for wides not a big fan of square format but ive never put that much time into it and could probably get used to it eventually
  i have no issues with 12 for film but i find it wasteful as an aspect ratio for mobile phone screens
  many modern smartphones have a  aspect ratio of 21 the iphone xs as well
i really like both night photography and long exposure stuff show me yours    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makecanoncamera modelcanon eos 1300dcamera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2018 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/35imagespecific propertiesimage width5184image height3456number of bits per component8 8 8pixel compositionrgbimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution240 dpivertical resolution240 dpiimage created20180920 223836exposure time22 secfnumberf/71exposure programmanualiso speed rating400lens aperturef/71exposure bias0 evmetering modepatternflashno flash compulsoryfocal length1800 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width5184image height3456renderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balancemanualscene capture typestandard

star filter meme faggetry
star filter makes everything cool
  especially with a tele
  literally kys you 3mbps internet speed having cock gobbler
  this is cool very effective sense of motion
  huh cool works well with architecture shots like that where the flares are parallel to the lines of the buildings
  yeah its kind a gimmicky though for some reason hoya decided to make this filter also a soft focus one which causes the annoying hangover vision thankfully its not really noticeable in night time shots but fucks up daylight shots like pic related
some long exposure shots with rollei 400ir tried stacking r72 and nd filters and hoped the nd worked the same for ir well turns out it does
  the weird stringy pattern in the bottom of the frame is left by a small bug that was flying around in front of the camera illuminated by sunlight

  thanks for your feedback anon it didnt work out perfectly but i didnt think it was that bad i had been on a trip to the outback for about 10 days and that was a spontaneous shot i took as we landed back in sydney only had one shot at it and my battery was so flat my camera literally turned off after snapping it wings bounce around a lot especially as that photo was right as the plane hit the tarmac i may try again someday whenever im on a plane again
  im not exactly sure what you did with the colours but i like the effect it has on the image    thanks i didnt really do all that much to the colors aside from basic curves adjustments i did add a light blue tint to the shadows and raised the black point a bit i like that skyline pic i wish my city was that photogenic    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makesonycamera modelilce7rm2camera softwareadobe photoshop cs6 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/20focal length 35mm equiv28 mmimagespecific propertiesimage width3000image height1731number of bits per component8 8 8pixel compositionrgbimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20180718 125826exposure time5 secfnumberf/56exposure programmanualiso speed rating640lens aperturef/56brightness35 evexposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flash compulsoryfocal length2800 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width3000image height1731renderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardcontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormal

  ah well considering the circumstances you did what you could like i said though if you can get it sharp itll be a great shot dicking around can often lead to great images and honestly man what i think doesnt matter as long as you like it      thanks man nice lightning strike

  thanks    i put the hornet on a black blanket or jeans it was sitting on its abdomen room was dark except for some light from the room next door  the long exposure was done with a mode called live composite it takes a pic with a base exposure and then only adds brighter changes to the base picture but only up to the duration of the base exposure this way you can light paint the same spot without overexposing i used my iphone and put a diffuser of a yongnuo flash around it to avoid harsh spots then just paint around until everything is lit up evenly preview of the exposure is live on the screen    tutorial i followed

    looks like an external shot of the nostromo    i love doing long exposures that reveal everything you cant see with your naked eye
  my fav from the thread the solid blue with the progression to more detail/figurative towards the left is really nice
was the first time i took northern lights pictures hope to do it again with more experience
and the second one made so many mistakes back then really wish i could afford another trip
hey guys i got a nikon coolpix l820 for free and i wanted to know if its possible to take long exposure photos i tried looking at the manual and it seemed to hint that shutter speed and fstop was specifiable but i couldnt seem to find out where in the camera software it was possible     is it possible if not is there some used camera i can get for under 100 that can do the job
took this a while ago
hey i am new here  how i make pics/videos at night  i want to climb and take photo and i dont want to get pic related    cheers
  the very first google search i made reveals that yes it is possible just have to change the shutter speed and experiment man obviously youll need the camera to be secure somewhere tripod etc but yep people are doing it so it can be done
  just get a used dslr and a tripod and a telephoto lens if you want to take moon pictures like that without being zoomed way out
  any reason for f22     there isnt any lens out there that gets sharper fast like f11 and if anything goes the other way    composition is nice but
  only guessing but he probably made the sacrifice in interest of longer exposure
  plenty of lenses are only starting to get into their sweet spot at f/22
  you could achieve the same with a slightly less exposure time doesnt look that bright      no
  only very modern lens designs are getting close to optimum sharpness at f/11 or f/16 on anything larger than mf its why a lot of photographers in the mid20th century thought of f/64 as synonymous with sharpness even nowadays with something like a ssxl its best to stop down unless youre extremely confident in your film holders as the depth of focus on wide angle lens is razor thin
i mean i cant do all the fancy shit other people are doing but its good practice

  photo thread bump
        cool best in thread imo              kinda cool too
  the laptop lookd out of place great shot otherwise
  the shot would have looked a lot better if you didnt try to use a selective mask to raise the exposure on the road and those signs it just looks completely out of place with the surroundings and the amount of noise it just looks like shit and draws too much attention away from the sky which is actually shot not too bad the dark foreground actually makes for a nice moody feel    if you wanted the foreground to be visible you should have took a separate photo of it whether that was when you had more light or using a long exposure is up to you
  yeah looks gross and i didnt even realized i uploaded that shitty version just some road highlighting experiment heres a better version of it thanks for the feedback anyways and im certainly trying different shots for the foreground next time    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop lightroom classic 75 windowsimagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution240 dpivertical resolution240 dpiimage created20181106 010655color space informationsrgb

  i like it great pic anon
  a well lit part of a city that couldve ended up as a cool night shot but you somehow managed to fuck up
  i dont know if that was the effect that you originally intended but it totally works here great shot      proof its more about the photographer than the gear great eye and good capture not perfect but a solid effort
is this photo shite    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific properties
  shite no but it just looks like a snapshot picture is a bit out of focus doesnt seem to have a subject even though youre probably wanting the viewer to look at the water but the shutter speed isnt slow enough and water isnt silky enough plus its zoomed way in whats the point are you trying to capture turbulence or are you capturing smooth current you cant have both my eyes are wandering because composition isnt great that dude on the other side is distracting
  nice
anyone ever used 3rd party chinese grips over genuine or are they a meme
  yes i have one for my nikon and the only difference is its made of plastic instead of whatever heavy shit cost 300 dollars it functions the same got it off amazon if you are professional i wouldnt rely on it for obvious reasons
  i plan on professional work so i guess i will pass on the genuine
  ive seen many chink grips break easily or report battery levels to the camera incorrectly
  pretty much this they are just ok but the feel is usually pretty bad they can be kind of loose the trigger can have a horrible feel to it and the whole thing will squek like crazy
  report battery levels    they dont report anything that is why they are cheaper the camera should be monitoring the battery level anyway not the battery or other gear attached to it
i have one but it tells me its dead and i have to switch the two batteries around inside it and itll work again so its pretty fucking pointless for me to use it been sitting in a drawer after i figured that out
  thats more a battery than a grip problem batteries dont discharge evenly i have the same happening with my tv remote / other battery driven stuff    on the grips  i have a cheap one from neewer since about a year no problems / cracks till now payed 36 including 2 cheap batteries
  i bought one for my 80d after my oem grip broke and it feels exactly the goddamn same for 150 less i was pissed off and glad simultaneously     these 3rd party manufacturers have qc thats hit or miss however so find one from a company that has good return and exchange policies i havent run into any problems with mine yet but if i do i wouldnt hesitate to buy another one since six of these would equal a genuine canon grip also i bought it on amazon since theyll literally take returns on anything in any condition
  get a real used one from a reputable dealer when people trade in their shit for new stuff the battery grip is bought for buttons    i got a mbd11 for my d7000 for about the same as a chinese knockoff the desciption said it was well used but its perfect apart from a few scratches that are only visible in direct sunlight     many years ago i got a d40 with a crappy grip it was crap     i dont have massive hands but the grip is well comfy also the d pad is much better than the on camera one if you shoot portrait orientation moving the focus point is much easier than the standard one the real ones are also weather sealed and made of metal     just my 2 cents
where do japanese people showcase their photographies they probably have one of the highest density of photographers yet i rarely see japanese profiles on flickr or 500px each time a photo is posted taken in japan its shot by a gaijin tourist
tons on instagram newsflash  you wont find japanese photographers by using english hashtags
  unless you goto shows in tokyo theres a big japanese photography presence on instagram i know most of them
  knows most instagrammers from a country with a population of 126700000    k
  i personally know a lot of them    is that better
  ig and twitter i follow a whole bunch on twitter mostly to pin down good shooting spots for my own use
  i know most of them  is idiotic fallacy you should know better than that i also very much doubt you know any one of them better known names use bots and minions to run their instagram accounts so even if one of them kindly answered your adoration positively be aware that it was ether a silicon npc or a chinese sweatshop miner
  すごい
   look mum i said gaijin im japanese now
  whats your fucking problem
  im sorry that my reality is better than yours
  knowing instagrammers  a better reality    really makes you think
    post some links
  you being wrong
  admitting using instagram better than me sorry mate you just lost that argument right there
  admitting using instagram better than me  youre a 4chan user your life is shit
  youre 4chan user and instagram user and a giant weboo youre the cumstain on the dress of a filipino jerkshop tramqueen
  im not even the original guy   but keep projecting buddy
  i know who you are
  pls show some twitter profiles or shooting spots
        fuck off you braindead retard
    4channel  get with the times
holy shit this thread went downhill someone post some actually good amateur jap photographers
  relying on others to fix the problem  youre part of this shit show buddy
  i actually found a few good ones on instagram ryuji0915 for example
  looks like any other western digitog but replace the model with a jap girl and the location to some jap city

from what i know it still seems very show/zine/print based a lot of galleries eg in tokyo to go see stuff not surprising when you consider how japan is in general    you can find many like motohiko hasui or yusuke yamatani on instagram as well but they really dont seem to post much of their work and rarely use any hashtags

  nice colors this is my fave of the bunch    would you recommend the minolta for a light travel kit
  there is a lot of shit being thrown here at vintage zooms most of it might be reasonable too    but that lens is really outstanding i cant say anything about its corner sharpness since the a6000 is cropping that away but what i get is sharp enough even for larger prints contrast is great flare resistance is good im not a professional gear fag but i would say that this lens compares with lower end modern zooms easily    i took it with me on vacation this year its not really heavy either with 430g    the only thing i dont like about it is the fact that its not a zoombyturn so the lens drags itself out when its hanging downwards
    if youre looking for a minolta zoom the first version of the minolta 35105 af with macro is outstanding that said i use it with an old minolta 7000 so not sure how it handles digital

photographlet here     how is value created in photography why is rhein ii worth 43 million while unsplash has incredible and probably better composed pictures for free
  the one you have with you
  like with all art most of the value comes from provenance  is the artist famous  is the art piece considered significant  was it displayed in high status galleries  are other pieces of this artist collected by famous collectors  was the piece owned by somebody famous    and above all its an investment scheme for rich people as famous art pieces usually keep rising in price there is probably some tax evasion tactic in there as well
  charitably one could say that the market for high end artworks including photography is a little bit of a scam     uncharitably its definitely 100 a scam     the reason that photo is worth so much is just because thats what people have decided to value it as its a way for rich people to move around money and dodge taxes the monetary value isnt really related to the artistic quality
you have to do the math     your gear price / number of photos you took   taxes youre going to pay
  how is value created in photography    not speaking about gursky in specific but a very basic level a mounted 73  143 color photo print not ink jet is going to have significant expense just in the making of that image the largest ive ever printed was 40x 40 inkjet and it cost something stupid like 140 from a commercial shop unmounted i think the cheapest i could get a 40x40 print done today is like 5060 from my school print shop at cost     truly i have no idea how much it would cost but i highly doubt that you print and mount an image the size of rhein ii for less than several thousand dollars probably much more than that since youd need to custom order photo paper and your substrate since most sheet material comes in 48x96 sheets thats 6 wide photo paper at the narrowest and access to enlargers and developing equipment that can handle paper that size    of course that 43 mil is the price set by collectors but generally getting an image for free on unsplash is way different than getting something physically made
  i have no idea the weather is like that about half the year and not having ships in your way requires you to wait minutes at worst  also the motive isnt exactly interesting or special
  why is rhein ii worth 43 million while unsplash has incredible  a person could set their phd thesis around rhein ii  unsplash is barely disposable ikea art used to sell 050 pressboard frames marked up to 3000    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandvertical resolution72 dpicolor space informationsrgb
  its only worth what someone will pay for it    and by pay for it i mean  gallery space  advertising  good pr firm got your back hyping you up    if you get a good combination of all 3 then you can sell a turd nailed to a coffee table and command whatever starting price you want    but then again the art world is basically one giant tax haven
  its only worth what someone will pay for it  sure and a 100 bill costs the same to produce as a 5 bill value has been completely removed from material value functionality and cost
  did you read the rest of my post or did you already get your participation trophy and lose interest
  as  points out a significant aspect of this image which you miss in digital is its size and print quality also peripherally the large format perspective its not a simple task to produce these kinds of photographs  not to say that it isnt overvalued  gursky is like any other star artist in this respect what you are paying for is essentially the fame of the work  i dont know how you could find fault in the composition of this photo you might say its boring but it certainly achieves what it sets out to do
in addition to all of the above huge panel painting like single images are gold for the art market
   money laundering
its twice as good as rhein i  t art critic    seriously its about marketing     gursky could have sold this to getty alamy et al and make a couple bucks    he could also have sold it as limited edition gyclée prints from his squarespace website that hes pimping on facebook and make well most likely nothing    that said rhein ii and 99 cent ii i begin to see a pattern here are stellar works the photographs themselves and of course the presentation of the final artwork    finally i dont know how much gursky was paid but its nowhere near 3 mil he sold the work for a comfortable sum im sure but after that its crazy speculation/evasion as has been mentioned before
  youre not art critic this image is shit he took a snapshit of rein next to a powerplant and photoshoped powerplant out of it its got a silly hipster environmental message thanks to it and he printed it using some high end large scale technique that part of the work is unique and quite remarkable all of his prints are high end stuff and his name is actually legit he can make a nice shot at the same time he can make turds that still sell
  99 cent ii is pretty fuckin legit tho    rhein ii garbage
op isnt a gursky girl in a gursky world    youll never understand
    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesphotographerkevin mcdonoughimagespecific properties
  oh agreed 99cent it brilliant
    pretty sure its like  rich famous person a has an illegal gig  rich famous person b is a customer  a sells shitty modern art painting to b for 99999999999 trillion  transaction is now legitimate
  all art above 50000 is pretty much just a way to launder money
  depends achitecture and large sculptures can actualy be worth much more than 50000  however i agree for most pictures
  firstly because peter lik shoots with phase one cameras and can thus produce really large prints    secondly because he is a people person and not some socially retarded manlet    making money with photography is all about hustling and being good with people
  dont brink lik into this please hes an actual scam artist
im surprised people in here are aware of the laundery aspect based /p/ for once
  wait were you under the impression that the op image is a lik
  that speck in the middle    fuck these purist photographers just remove that dot with content aware fill or clone stamp tool jesus
  hes not at all a purist that photo is nothing like what that bank looks like in real life and he added a shitload of shelves to 99
  that speck  content aware fill  exaggerate much    ill take what is a spot healing tool for 200 alex
  if comparing to other photo  it make me feel more alive by looking at it      if you dont believe just try see some random snap and compared to this one stare for some second feel your the tense of your muscles mostly around torso and report which photo is create stronger tense
  high art is a front for money laundering
  i notice the most photographs are sold after years   think about it as a fine wine if you take your time and you brew a good wine leave it to the cellar to mature and years later is becomes more tasty    but make sure the wine is actually wine and not piss
  unsplash has incredible and probably better   why tf nobody laugh at this
  same with all high end art money laundering and investments
cultural significance and investment
  its called money laundering
  because i dont know what that is
  because theres a google and no excuse it would take you 5 seconds
  in the time it took you to tell him that he could google it you could also just have answered his question
  why wont you google my very funny joke so it makes sense to you dont you want to know how clever i am
  im not the same person as the original post lol
  well then its even weirder that youre telling me i have no excuse not to google what some random persons joke meant lol
  you realize even chosis sells photos for 1000 usd  right
    do not confuse price and value
  do you mean to say that chosis lists prints for comical prices that nobody is actually paying

macbook pro
  the best laptop  there is no singular best laptop just buy anything with decent ram/processing power and itll run photoshop just fine
2012/2013 retina macbook pro should be more than enough for photoshop and lightroom although try to go for a model with at least 8gb of ram
  macbook pro
  macbook air  photo editing is not really that resource intensive
        dont listen to them op
  why
old fag from /g/ with a computer science degree here and a paid photographer get a macbook air/pro anything post 2013 model is fine
  the air doesnt have the retina screen and is the same price as the pro now
  the new air has a retina screen   t faggot who wants to sell my pro for the new air
  the latest air refresh has a retina screen      agreed i do all of my editing on a 2017 air and only upgraded from a 2012 air because my thirdparty ssd died
    oh weird i was looking at them just a month ago and they didnt must have just missed the refresh
dont get a macbook air pros are fine  anything with accurate color is good  you might want to look at the new thinkpad x1 carbon
  yeah they just announced them a week or two ago max screen is almost the same except the pro can get a hair brighter
you could spend 500 and be fine for photo editing hell if you go used you could make due with 250 photoshop isnt that resource intensive
  used ips thinkpd
/g/entooman here  cheap refurb thinkpad with a replaced ips panel or buy her one of those modern top end ones with a 4k one if you really want to spend 2k oh you dont have to get get the latest model either since the difference is minuscule between cpus  lasts 10 years has a better keyboard actually has a trackpad beats the crap out of macbook performance easy repairs better customer supportif you care about that better battery much better thermals no planned obsolescence and you can turn them into hackintoshes if your sick mind wills it  or if you and her really likes macs and cant handle the look of chinkpads get her an older high end pro model newer ones arent that much stronger than the older ones while being much cheaper  also  needing something powerful for photo editing  you could spend 150 and be fine for photo editing my 2013 macbook pro and t420 still works fine i just dont use them any longer since i have better solutions for travelling now but for the love of god do not get an air they dont work as computers    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage width600image height450
      judging by the photos they look like they were taken with an iphone x  if im correct spend 500 on a refurb thinkpad/old model macbook pro and get her proper camera equipment something like a x230t is really old but doubles as a drawing tablet  if shes actually serious about her photography she would want a camera instead of using her phone
thinkpad x1 yoga and then install gentoo on it  alternatively a macbook pro  these photos look shit btw she doesnt need a good laptop to post them on facebook
  of course the guy spending 2k on his sister is a some rich saudia prince
    unironically though this get a late 2015 model with 16gb ram used for like 450 it has enough power to get her using lightroom/capture one as well as full on photoshop plus it has a built in sd reader and a decent enough screen
  used macbook  fuck off refurbs are better unless you enjoy apples planned obsolescence kicking in  good job bumping a shitty thread by the way
  unironically the best advice in this thread
stupid questions that need no extra thread post them here and get enlightened  last thread 
  can one milk a certain location indefinitely when it comes to photography  i never took photos out of a 20 km range  t travellet
why does everyone bitch about the trends when they are weak and always give into them
  one day it would only become masturbation but why not     there are plenty stuff you can experiment within a 20km range      trends are trends and trends sucks but people can see how to milk it
i tried my hand at panning question is regarding crop should i crop it that there is more space in the direction my subject is running or crop it with more space behind him  i feel the running into space works better      i stay in cape town and every day i see the same old photos of table mountain on my instagram with hundreds of likes thousands if you get reposted by some travel site and it just gets so tiring but after saying that if you plan on shooting different things then yeah you could get a lot out of your town/city go to festivals/hikes/demonstrations/night life and so on    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makecanoncamera modelcanon eos 80dcamera softwareadobe photoshop lightroom classic 731 windowsmaximum lens aperturef/18imagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution240 dpivertical resolution240 dpiimage created20181127 062821exposure time1/40 secfnumberf/110exposure programmanualiso speed rating100lens aperturef/110exposure bias0 evmetering modepartialflashno flash compulsoryfocal length5000 mmcolor space informationsrgbrenderingnormalexposure modemanualwhite balanceautoscene capture typestandard
what would /p/ recommend for homeprinting printer  photo paper mainly  is printing your own photos at home more costeffective than bringing your sd card to a photo kiosk
  demonstrations/night life  nah i like my gear kept intact
im using a tripod as a lightstand with a large softbox and speedlight bowens s type adapter the adapter itself is fine but it made to go onto a lightstand rather than a thread i have a tripod thread adapter inside it and since it is single thread my softbox always spins in a circle with mild wind    how do i stop this adapter with two threads and plate with two screws    or just go light stand route used to have them    i figure a tall light stand is going to be heavier than my tripod for the same effective height and falls over easier and doesnt work well on nonflat surfaces eat foot as to be level    tripod can stick legs futher out a little so it doesnt fall over or use hook to hang bag on and can also adjust legs for different heights at each foot    what do
  not saying you should go to war torn darfur or take pictures while moshing to black metal     i meant more in this vein  light trails on the highway skyline at night your qt314 friend who secretly likes you and would love if asked her to take pictures of her with her torn jeans and sunglasses at night
  is printing your own photos at home more costeffective than bringing your sd card to a photo kiosk  almost never but its more convenient and theres a lot to be said for that     i dont actually have a printer recommendation i use an epson i picked up at a thrift store
how do i know if a lens is broken or if its just a characteristic of the lens and it not being able to resolve detail as well as id like    i went out and took some photos today but 90 of them seem like focus is missed detail is missing and the photos just seem unclear in general  im using a d7500 and a tamron sp 1750mm f/28  heres an example picture of what i mean picture is unclear seems like it missed focus or i maybe moved but i was using single point af and had a very steady position so i doubt i moved a whole lot ive got a whole lot of pictures like these where nothing seems to be in focus and especially in more crowded scenes forest with a million leaves and branches everywhere it gets even worse    is this just me being shit or is the problem the lens    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makenikon corporationcamera modelnikon d7500camera softwarenikon d7500 ver100maximum lens aperturef/28sensing methodonechip color areafocal length 35mm equiv57 mmimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20181127 133710exposure time1/60 secfnumberf/28exposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating100exposure bias0 evmetering modepatternlight sourceunknownflashno flashfocal length3800 mmcolor space informationsrgbexposure modeautowhite balanceautoscene capture typestandardgain controlnonecontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnessnormalsubject distance rangeunknown

  hey /p/ this is probably a stupid question but thats what this thread is for i was wondering which is better for wildlife a     24mp full frame or a 24mp apsc sensor  also is 36mp full frame equivalent to a 24mp apsc  also sony a7ii or a7r    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cs3 windowsimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20130521 201106color space informationsrgbimage width1200image height1863
sony rx100 iii brand new is on ebay right now for 478 decent price on amazon new is more than 600
  well better question is is it a scam
  full frame gives better image quality crop is almost as good but much lighter and smaller for the same field of view neither is 100 better than the other you have to pick your preferred trade off     get the a7 ii over the a7r unless you really need the extra resolution for something which you probably dont image stabilization will help you with more photos than extra pixels
how much would you sell an average used canon eos 5d but in good condition for
  theyre going for like 300 on keh did you get the mirror fixed or is it a ticking timebomb
  been on /pol/ and /fit/ for about 2 years but just now checking out /p/ do you guys discuss videography too or just photography

under which lighting do eyes look the brightest  trying to bring out the colour of the eyes for portraits  editing is possible on this but i prefer the natural way
ive got a d5200 and a macbookpro2012    how can i set up onionskinning for stopmotion
  make sure you have a reflector bouncing back at them even then youll need to edit
  mirror is fixed took it in and they said its good to sell
  you are using a normal focal length at 1/60 of a second in this short according to your exif bump that up to at least 1/125 or something 1/250 and above should get rid of essentially all shake its really probably only that
  find a well lit subject and try the 1/400s  1/800s ss range  tighten that motherfucker up on tripod and use a 2 second timed shutter    if that doesnt fix it up then nothing will
    alright thanks for the tips ill try and make another trip to where i took these photos to get comparisons     i believe i was in p mode for most of it just as a test and autoiso was turned off so shutter speed in that particular situation didnt go higher maybe if i up the iso it would let me go with a faster shutter speed    ill bring the tripod as well and do the delayed shutter thing but it is looking like i might be at fault here
  under which lighting do eyes look the brightest  under continuous light    makes the pupil restrict exposing more of the iris  ring lights are a classic and many of them have a modeling light which you can keep om to give the eyes some time to adjust and shrink the pupil
how do you upload from your computer to your instagram
  easiest to just put them on google drive/dropbox or whatever and access the files from your phone     there are probably solutions to do it direct from pc but ive never bothered
when i want to take a picture of a 1520 m large object from about 1000m distance with an aps c sensor what kind of focal length do i need
  i already do that they say the quality is better if you do it through the computer
  whos they     i cant see why youd care too much about quality everyones viewing them in minuscule resolution on their phones anyway
any a73 owners know if theres a way to silence the beep sound when focusing ive found silent mode but that seems to be only silent shutter as i still hear the focus beeps everytime
  it improves the quality viewing on their phone numbnuts

noobie and brainlet here    so i just got a new lens the olympus mzuiko 25mm f18 does this lens not have a zoom function the standard kit lens that i have has a basic zoom function but this new lens doesnt seem to have that turn zoom
  notice how your kit lens have a range of say 1235mm and this lens has only one value  25mm it means that this one wont zoom it will stay 25mm its called prime lens and while it does not have zoom it also has some advantages over the zoom lenses theres enough info on the internet about prime lens vs zoom lens differences    its a great lens also the focal length of 25mm on your camera will give an universal field of view so you can really try variety of styles and themes with it you just have to give it some time to shine for few weeks theres a good chance you wont go back to your kit lens
  ah i see thanks for the explanation im already liking it more than the kit lens
  i already know alot of the pros/cons of prime/zoom    but id be really interested if you wouldnt mind sharing some personal observations about your experiences with it

  you are pressing the button from both sides yes
whats the point of evf if you have a big live view screen you can zoom in on
  you can also zoom in on the evf plus you get the added stability of holding the camera against your face
  500mm should do it
  brightness picture quality and focus evaluation lcd screen will be invisible in bright sunshine and you wont be able to see whats in focus as well on it as on evf  now know that there is a huge difference between cheap evf and quality evf some pnshoot and entry level mirrorless evfs are basically just small lcd screens with bad refresh rates you wont even be able to asses for sure whats in focus without different tools g5 a7iii is usually where you need to go to get really quality ones for midrange i think only em10ii is in that category now with the next gen mirrorless from canon and expecially nikon you start to see some really special stuff z7s is practically brilliant in the night
what does the be there mean in f8 and be there
  you know where the interesting picture is happening    there be there
  oh okay thanks
  could i get more context on this quote
  its an oldschool response to people who used to worry a lot about gear and specific camera settings it means that its more important to show the fuck up and take the fucking picture than it is to sit at home worrying that your gear isnt good enough or stand on the sidelines dicking around with your exposure values when you should be trying to actually get the shot     ie dont worry about the technical details dont worry about having a fast lens and getting tack sharp focus just take whatever camera you have set it to an aperture where things are pretty much in focus through the frame and go to where the photography is    more than a little outdated in the modern era with autofocus and autoexposure and such but the core idea that you should put yourself into positions where youre more likely to get a good picture is sound
when im looking through the viewfinder am i supposed to keep the other eye open
  you can do whichever is most comfortable for you keeping your left eye open assuming a right eye shooter allows you to also see your surroundings which can be an advantage in certain situations

  did you get the negatives back if so the frame on the negative should be half black which means the shutter has gotten stuck halfway but this looks like a scanning mistake      this is normal for the first shot on the roll i usually advance an extra frame to avoid getting pics like this
  please do me a favor and downvote this stupid fuck  
  no i havent the negatives from this roll in particular back yet but i do have negatives from the first roll which has the same problem
xtrans or bayer sensorwhich is bettertrying to decide between fuji x100 and x100f
  the f is better than the first gen in pretty much every way thats not a decision you should be making based on the filter layout if you have the money for the f then get it the first gen is what people get when they compromise because theyre poor

  hmmm the leica m6 ttl   known to have meter and occasionally shutter problems that the other m6 doesnt have   thin top plate that will crack or shatter if you drop the camera   cluttered framelines for lenses you will never use   ugly battery compartment in the front   ugly red dot and stamped text on front   has a meter but not ae as if thats an acceptable compromise for the late 80s and 90s  its a good camera but its hardly an all time classic like the m3 or m4 were both of which didnt really have flaws other than curves m3 framlines and 35/135 paired frames on the m4
  unironically the one you have with you
the pentax k1000
  arricam st
  meme leica  not m3
fuji x100
  close   the mp mechanical perfection is all and only the best from the m6 and the m3
    if the best camera ever were a rangefinder it would be a cle zeiss ikon or a contax g2
out of all the ones ive tried probably the olympus om10 i know id probably enjoy the more premium models more but the om10 is so satisfying to shoot with
  contax g2 is not a rangefinder no matter how much you want it to me    cle is cool but the baselength isnt long enough for fast lenses    zeiss ikon is objectively superior to leicas in every possible way suck it fagots
  theres no point in calling it a viewfinder camera either
  just dont drop it
the most comprehensive camera system ever made     all lenses are incredible for their designed use     huge level of accessories and interchangable parts     amazingly bright acutematte screen that blows anything out the water in modern standards     it went to the fucking moon     digital backs if you like them cfv are gems    even ansel adams stopped shooting large format because the hasselblad did everything he wanted to

  lol no    zeiss ikon is objectively superior to leicas in every possible way  except build quality   the rangefinder itself is beautiful and the slr style film door is nice but the body feels flimsy and that plasticy twang of the shutter is garbage compared to the nice slick sound of a leica cloth shutter   leica is also infinity repairable good luck getting an ikno fixed once it shits the bed
  nam  thats cute
  thats cute and all with a ww2 era hasselblad but the nikon f probably legit changed the course of the vietnam war
the nikon f probably legit changed the course of the vietnam war  im pretty sure america would have eaten shit with or without the nikon f     not going to say that it didnt play an important part getting the message back home but it wasnt exactly the only 35mm camera choice
  thats telly savalas isnt it

wheres deadpan and architecture
street is the worst kind of photography imaginalbe
  t macro flower shooter
really
  i didnt see gear photography so i didnt vote  i would settle for trashcan photography as well maybe back of my chair photography
    find art    well done for being another pleb commercial photographer with no idea fine art exists
    youre both wrong and dumb
fuck that here is a proper straw poll        be the first to vote
  what do i get
  this
  real estate  pet  i can live with that
i get this is mostly done in jest but sometimes i have the feeling that some people here really do see the world in such simple terms

sorry my browser bugged out the full title of the shot is friday on a monday
bump looking for feedback on my masterpiece
  window raindrops with bokeh balls backdrop is a picture that has been taken tens if not hundreds of thousands of times yours does nothing to stand out also the name doesnt make any sense because it doesnt relate to anything in the picture    also dont make threads for a single photo
  friday night wank
  absolutely kino moment bravo i love the sharp rain drop i love the out of focus lights very original and unique wow amazing
  show us some of your work hotshot
  nah im alright you asked for feedback and you got it
  thanks i downloaded this image and my boss is giving me 250 for it
  so this is what sonyggers take photos of not surprised one bit
  kys
  has 2k camera  has 1k lens  takes meme photos
  that is what i expected honestly you can dish it out but cant take it
  was anything i said wrong
  usually when i stumble upon such pieces of work i set the picture on full screen and prepare myself some coffee sometimes even an expensive bottle of red wine and stare at the art whilst drinking my beverage it really takes a giant idiot to think that these delicacies are appreciated by a quick image hover on 4chan when in reality one has to study it as if it were in a museum who would appreciate starry night if it was on your 200 phones screen because lets be honest if youre a regular in this board youre most likely poor or on your 1080p blackfridaydeal laptop distance yourself from your own mental limitations and do something right for once    anyways when i finished my drink i had to take a moment for myself if you know what i mean this picture has led me to believe that i must obtain whatever gear you used in order to take my craft one step closer to your masterpiece what a magnificent photography you have created here anon i cannot believe that your work hasnt been published in magazines or presented in art galleries all around the world truly a thing to behold and it boggles my mind that youre not a tripfag or else i would follow your work closely even the title of this work is just i i have no words to describe what i felt    please keep us updated this board needs more professional photographers like you if only half of the idiots that browse this board would have an ounce of your creative mind this wouldnt be such a barbaric gearfagging board as it is in its current state    thanks for making my day anon and i wish to see more of your art often you should sign your photographs

my wife has had this camera for years i think she used it once or whoever sold it to her used it to show her how it still works and she was talking about selling it but since its not expensive that would be a waste  so she now says she wants to use it if she can and i wanna know whether or not thats even possible i mean if one wanted to use it what should one even begin do they even sell film for these any more    soon well have plenty of spare room so i could even build her a small development lab i know shed love that    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makemotorolacamera modelmotog3maximum lens aperturef/20imagespecific propertieshorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage created20181126 203424exposure time6001/100000 secfnumberf/20exposure programnormal programiso speed rating1000lens aperturef/20brightnessunknownexposure bias0 evmetering modecenter weighted averageflashflash compulsoryfocal length364 mmcolor space informationsrgbimage width4160image height2340renderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balanceautocontrastnormalsaturationnormalsharpnesssoftgeodetic survey datawgs84

  search bh for 35mm film they make it still and still make huge varieties of it shoot a roll send it to an online darkroom thedarkroomcom is pretty ok
  yes it should be possible assuming the shutter still fires and everything just open the back cock the shutter and fire it to verify that it hasnt gotten gummed up or anything    it actually uses standard easilyavailable alkaline batteries for the meter which is a plus and regular old 35mm film

  its decent those helios lenses have some pretty cool bokeh though
  i mean its acceptable those slrs if working are all pretty similar so if its working then thats all that matters good is as far as id go in that sense its not exactly one of those cameras people gush over like a leica m3 or anything but its probably built to last long enough for you to lose interest in it
  do they even sell film for these any more  you could have just googled this of course they do and you can also use m42 mount lenses which are cheap plentiful and often pretty decent   if it works it works a film slr is basically just a dark box with a hole that can be opened and closed if it can reliably and precisely control the interval in which the hole is open and keep the box completely dark at every other time then it does everything its supposed to
  do they still sell film for random common 35mm film camera is one of those questions thats so obvious that its hard to google if you dont understand cameras enough to know that its a 35mm film camera you wont even know where to start its like googling whether or not bears need oxygen yes they do but its so obvious that they do that no one is likely to set up a dobearsneedoxygenmil to provide an answer to that specific question     so give the guy a break

  well spotted the slides themselves are all dated 1965 and by looking at contemporary photos im pretty sure that the assembly line photos are all from the british motors corporation plant at longbridge outside of birmingham which closed in 2016 the austin 1100 actually helped me pinpoint the location since they were only made in two factories in britain    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesequipment makecanoncamera modelcanon eos 700dcamera softwareadobe photoshop cc 20155 windowsimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution300 dpivertical resolution300 dpiimage created20181007 155508exposure time1/60 secexposure programaperture priorityiso speed rating200exposure bias07 evmetering modepatternflashno flash compulsorycolor space informationuncalibratedimage width1500image height1048renderingnormalexposure modeautowhite balancemanualscene capture typestandard

  first off thanks for posting these anon to think these could have gone to landfill never to be seen again good job on the scanning too did you need to do much post in the edits or are they almost sooc    secondly this guy has an amazing eye for composition and narrative every photo so far is great especially as they seem to be just random shots from jobs that hed done no recycle bin back then so he put them back in the box the money shots went to the client i presume    this whole thread so far has really inspired me ive got so lazy with photography   meh i can crop in later  meh i can sort the exposure in post  meh i can take shoot 12 frames and prolly get something  ive been snatching images for years now instead of raising my camera with purpose and intent    back then though you didnt study photography at a university at best it was as part of a diploma at a polytechnic or as an apprentice while working in the uk anyway     again thanks op this has been the kick up the backside ive needed for a while all from some slides in a bin while ive been typing set 2 has started good stuff
  if anyone is interested it says free wales
quality thread
doing gods work anon
  just laughing at how fucking white the people in the photos are  awesome work preserving and sharing this guys discarded photos op how old is he whats he like
  i cropped most of the cardboard frame and adjusted the white balance to counteract the warm backlight i used but otherwise these are just as shot hence all the dust and such    and i agree this guy really knew how to take advantage of a compelling scene when he saw it    and these have been driving me to take pictures that i previously might have been too timid or lazy to take
  the photographer died in 2006 the guy who threw them out is in his mid60s id say and like i mentioned earlier has got some stuff going on    william p gottlieb sounds like he was a pretty interesting guy he knew everyone who was anyone making jazz in its heyday the library of congress has an archive of his work here 
  i love the chaos of this picture all of these are pretty incredible
  do you actually know if he doesnt want them or did you steal his shit through retardation when he was moving stuff
these are lovely op well done
  give me a little credit anon i ran into him while he was throwing away some camera bags and filters and lens caps and other shit so i asked if i could have anything useful he threw out he doesnt care he just wants it all gone and they were right next to a dumpster that was also filled with even more slides and prints
archiveorg n chill
  you rock op thx for this thread
i would suck your dick for sharing these   good shit op    keep an eye on the cucked boomer recover all the dumpster shit     what cameras he threw in the dumpster
these are incredible to think they couldve ended up gone forever i wonder how many more collections like this will never be rediscovered     it would be a crime not to have these digitised properly and hosted somewhere like archiveorg or better yet some sort of museum
  dudes going through a divorce  what do you bet shes divorcing him because hes too obsessed with photography and this is part of the bargaining stage of grief
some absolute stunners here dude knew how to connect his lines with perfection                      masterclass
these are delightful      is definitely my favourite having looked through this thread a couple times     thanks for posting op     sobering to realize how often years and years of work just ends up on the landfill my friends uncle passed away earlier this year and im helping deal with all the camera sales  i asked the family what happened to all of his work and the guys son just straight up threw it all away granted he wasnt a pro or anything but its crazy to think you can shoot your whole life and its all gone like that
  kek literal garbage pictures that are 10x better than whats usually on /p/
tfw no one tries to save your work when you trash it

  the guys son just straight up threw it all away    years ago i stole the big cardboard box full of family photos and negatives from my mums house she pulled me up on it and i said i was just scanning some of them most of the photos were later photos of her and her boyfriend on holiday    she died a few years later some of the photos are 100 years old some i took as a little kid no give it back its not a toy the chances of that box being binned were high i think i took them back then because that box had my history in it    sure nobody is interested seeing my grandfather in short pants nor him in uniform before the battle of the atlantic thats personal to me    photography is capturing a moment in time to be remembered putting photos in a bin is verging on well wrong    i hope in life i have enough time to upload some of those images to the datasphere so in another one hundred years time a distant relation can see themselves
  how
  how  tripod meter over exposed a bit but a nice capture    that being said william p gottlieb  may have just jammed his camera into a wall or fence for stability
          its hard to look at these and imagine how a child growing up today with an ipad in his hands and a fucking gluten allergy would ever become an actual man
  wow
  shockingly great shots i kinda thought some were cliche but id imagine the cliches here were fresh 60 years ago kinda cool to think that these were taken when the leica m3 was still in production and the nikon f was the new hot thing id imagine ektachrome was moderately new then too this was really an exciting time for photography probably a heyday as strong as the 40s and 50s were with bresson and the large format modern masters some of this work is almost comparable
  thanks so much for sharing     these are insanely good photos and well preserved too    to think they were to be trashed
just want to throw in another thank you op for now ill have a proper look through them once i have more time
rare good thread    thanks for saving these
these photos are excellent hard to believe anyone would throw them out thank you for taking your time and effort to make this thread and share them op
    lol what star trek planet is this
op here just wanted to thank you all for looking and enjoying im very glad that everywhere ive shown these so far people have been as captivated by them as i am ill probably do another pass through the collection this weekend and bump with more content if the thread is still up then      he didnt toss any cameras unfortunately i know he has an nikon f2 on a shelf up there and honestly thats what i was keeping my eye on the trash for in case he tossed it       its cool to see more contemporary pictures of piccadilly circus like  what context did you find these in anon      i am super interested to know what equipment this guy was using especially the lens my best guess would be a nikon with a 24 or 28mm and i agree that some of these would definitely be cliche if they werent so perfectly matched by the film used and the setting they were made in
wow these are amazing thank you for sharing op
some of these photos are insane better than the usual drivel that gets put on here
   with a 24mm or 28mm  honestly back then those were considered extremely wide angle for general use most people didnt go walking around with such wide angles 35mm was really popular then as was 50mm 24mm was used but they werent as popular and were often much more expensive today phones come with a 28mm equivalent so it doesnt really feel wide to most people today i think these shots easily could have been done with a 35mm but the camera is definitely still the question
best thread on /p/ in years    keep an eye on this dude these are masterful level slides holy shit bookmarked    they arent even good because they are old they are good because they are good
  man i was just thinking about longbridge looking at the pictures based on the disappeared british industry theme and then one of the pictures is actually from there
    damnit quit screwing around and hit the ball jim
   they arent even good because they are old they are good because they are good   this
  kino
  great picture old english businessman on the right and englands changing future on the left
these are fucking incredible photos
thread of the fucking year
good shit op thanks for sharing
holy shit am i glad i decided to click over to /p/ tonight after seeing this thread
tfw photos that were thrown out and considered trash are way better than anything youve ever taken   _
  thats because he cared more about his subject matter and his work than he cared about instagerm likes and what some spotty twats on 4chan though about his camera
  not just one               are all most likely longbridge
  thanks for sharing op these are great im glad that you saved them
digicucks have been obliterated itt
    flickr  op can you make the large sizes available for download on flickr
  op im serious these belong in an exhibit these are amazing you should get them professionally scanned at extreme high resolution and print them for exhibit this is an amazing look back in time to a lost culture
  hush you
back when britain was a real country fucking liberals have finished us off
  these photos are good but only because they were shot on film given the exact same scenes and execution with a digital camera these photos would have been dogshit  filmfags truly are the worst kind of gearfag
these deserve to be scanned at high resolution and archived    thank you op
these fucking pictures boomed me theyre so good
note to self shoot 30 degrees off parallel for any long straight lines walls cars buildings
  you know we only think theyre good because nobody from here took them right

  go back to your cuck shed
dude please keep these for him the regret might set in and you can gift them back     they are truly incredible
  amazing stuff thank you for sharing
      brilliant      it does seem to be a thing in many of these shots like     is this one of those general composition things everybodys supposed to know like eg rule of thirds
          this brings back memories tramnik one at the blackpool illuminations first saw it in 1971 as a little kid    a second feature car was built in 1961 using the frame of pantograph tram 168 of 1928 this was tramnik one a space rocket based loosely on sputnik the underframe was designed as a launch pad which disguised the driving cab the passenger saloon was raked at 45 degrees to show the rocket as ready for takeoff passengers boarded at the rear  from the rails  through the exhaust of the rocket  the rocket was retired in 1999 with wiring problems it was preserved in 2002 and ran a farewell tour in april 2002 after a decade in store it moved to the blackpool illuminations lightworks centre to be cosmetically restored and for 2012/3 became the centrepiece of an illuminations display at gynn square  pic related
those pictures are great following you on flickr now thanks for the discovery
  tramnik one  very neat
bump this thread is tops he was a great photographer
beautiful especially the night pictures i managed to buy a bunch of slide film a while ago and it really has its own beauty i wish kodachrome was still around though
bump some of the best photography ive ever seen
bump for content
  you have really shit taste my faggot
  been doing a basic search on william p gottlieb as im sure you did too interesting guy not really a photographer by choice but had that eye most of us wish for the photos here seem to be from working holidays in northwestern europe when he was in his late forties     these two links are enough to scratch the surface if anyone is interested      in line with gottliebs wishes his photographs were put into the public domain    im the tramnick guy  this is llanberis on a clear day i can see mount snowdon yr wyddfa from my window 50 miles away i bet he went up there on the little train but didnt take a photo 90 of the time the peak is under cloud cover    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cs4 macintoshimagespecific propertiesimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage created20120214 202154color space informationuncalibratedimage width903image height950
  thanks op for preserving history and art heres the full res set ripped from flicker   
  how do you scan slides good when i try to scan slides they dont look like the original slide
why does it feel like every single one of these has soul is it film is it the subjects the photographer
  1 great eye  2 subjects that no longer exist  3 colours    in that order
  this is the royal and ancient golf club in st andrews fife the building is recognizable but there have been some substantive changes and the area behind it and to the right of it has been developed since this photo      this is south of st andrews along the fife coastal path
    these make an amazing pair even the subjects poses are matched to an extent
best damn thread ive seen in awhile thanks op
  these are really cool lad anyone know what colliery this is my dad used to work as a miner back in the day really interested in my local heritage
bump to kino
  not op but see   ncb lothians area  national coal board  lothians    most likely scotland lowlands se there might be notes written on the slide holder that identify the specific colliery
  op can you post a few of his bland photographs for comparison
  lol u telling me its been like 2 years since the last time i browsed /p/ and i just randomly stumble across this gold    also seems like this inbred faggot is still alive 
  ill see if i can whip a few up this weekend    its funny so many people here are complementing this photographers eye and knack for composition when you look through the collection though you can see him working out the best ways to capture each scene and for each shot where he nails it there are at least two or three of the same scene that arent quite there you can really tell that hes working hard to get the absolute best image he can out of each scene through trial and error a process which i know mirrors my own approach to photography and likely that of many other people here as well     is a great case in point ill have to post some of the shots he took of this same scene that just dont have the same impact as this one
    can op post the full set somewhere
legendary thread thank you op
    all of the images in this thread plus a few extras are on flickr see     i may scan the whole collection at some point but no promises what you see here are my favorite 100 or so shots of what must be a good 400 or 500 slides overall
  wonderful thread especially like this one
  i think the second point is something a lot of people overlook about old photography when you see old photos you are automatically interested the old shops the old hairstyles the old cars it all interests us because we rarely see it people seem to mix up this interest with thinking the photo is good in the traditional sense were the same photo was taken today (((todays cars todays shops todays hairstyles i think often the photos wouldnt be as compelling     that being said the photos in this thread are in my opinion good the traditional sense great use of space and framing composition etc
  a guy commented on flickr that this is the jostedal glacier in norway the largest in europe the ice coverage has diminished greatly since 1965
hey op this inspired me to buy a few thousand kodachrome slides off ebay i tried to pick lots that had interesting stories in the description its surprisingly cheap to get huge lots many are family vacations but i have seen some amazing sets on ebay i have a few thousand to sort through eventually when they come and if theyre good ill post em    i wonder how many great photos have ended up in the trash or ebay
  pathetically sad as badly as i want to be right wing on a huge amount of issues the right being so destructive to the environment is killing me to be fair its been everyones fault until recently but now its probably too late and we might be the last generation or so to actually see some of the remaining great wonders and species of the world before theyre gone for that reason i almost never hesitate taking pictures of nature because while the argument in ansel adams time was that people are ephemeral and nature is forever an argument against his pictures it turns out that both individuals and a frightening amount of nature is ephemeral    that glacier wont exist when people find our slides in 50 years
  this is from bergen norway interestingly not much has changed from this view the boats are however never there anymore the fish market is a tourist trap
  the framing of the castle wall in the back to fill the frame is what makes this so good its a banal picture in many regards but the background statue of victoria and the kid really all work perfectly together    i guess street lights have always been a hugely popular thing to shoot    thumbnail looked ass but glad i clicked this is actually a lot better than i expected the kid in the tricycle next to the wall is almost surreal    not a big deal of a picture artistically but i personally like it a lot    like a painting very good    also painting like    lovely
thanks for this thread op you convinced me not to throw away my annoying heaping collection of film
    yfw slides have 57 stops of dynamic range tops
  twilight on one of those days where the suns just barely gone down and the moons just started to come up enough ambient light to expose for the building without overexposing the moon too badly

this guy was amazing definitely going to study what he did and try to learn as much as i can
    jesus christ    ill personally kill you if you dont post those
  i definitely will but again no scanner and ill have to probably do manual dusting because digital ice doesnt work with kodachrome and these are dusty as fuck    these will definitely be posted here and on instagram may even start collecting more old slides from estates put them together into books or something archive the rest online i got them specifically so a collector wouldnt so ill make sure one way or another they end up in the public domain they need cleaning which scares me kodachrome is brittle and editing many underexposed and missed focus shots and some could use artistic cropping used sparingly    not all are from japan many others from the big box are from europe mostly postwar germany and greece and egypt the greek and egyptian ones are actually almost as interesting as the ones from hiroshima    one pictured is from a box labeled nagasaki and the date stamp on the box is gone but i assume 1953ish    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiesimagespecific propertiesimage orientationrighthand topimage width4032image height3024
      just curious which shots you two think are perhaps cliche
  came to /p/  saw thread of the year  found my new haircut    today was a good day
  despite really enjoying these scans they are not exceptional in their quality  probably they are leftovers of series and there exist similar pictures with even better quality  from my experience with my boss the guy probably owns hundreds if not thousands of these highlevel midtier scans   also if youve been long enough in the business i guess you get dulled to that generic photography generic aka you cant sell them or exhibit them quite frankly i would immediately throw out 80 of my scans if wasnt attached to them by feelings
  pffff nevermind the ipad or the allergies but the crippling depression and nihilism that inevitable awaits anybody growing up with half a brain really tears apart my little heart seeing these if i imagine how life must have been growing up without the internet and the everlasting feeling of uselessness and forgone opportunities
these are medicore shots the only big advantage is kino kodachrome chemistry   this prove that you fags will suck off anything which is slightly vintage or old   you faggots are disgusting and it makes me cringe
  god youre a tight arse
  if youre a cute twink with femine dick then i will loose my hole for you 3
  dad always tells a story about basic training in the army where the drill sergeant asked how everyone was doing  say good get pushups  say bad get pushups  one day someone says medicore  ds says i dont know what that means but do more pushups  i think my dad doesnt know the word mediocre  see somebody else literally write medicore    is this actually a way people pronounce the word where are you from this has been a 20 year mystery to me    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2018 windowsimagespecific propertiesimage width950image height622pixel compositionunknownimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution72 dpivertical resolution72 dpiimage created20181102 235437color space informationuncalibratedimage width950image height622
  did you consider the possibility that maybe its you who have shit taste
  every photo taken by an pro photog on kodachrome from this era look like these shots he nailed the compo in only few of his shots although he had good sense of compo but i feel like he never pushed himself there is nothing special or stylistic about these   i have seen too many photographs from last century so these dont interest me with context to his era or not    there is something magical about kodachrome
  agree with this mentality and that old kodachrome was magical but i still think there are a few standouts here not museum quality but far better than average
  medicore  i think you mean mundane a random box of slides in a bin the best 20 of a dead guys holiday snapshits from one box get posted here the vast majority are stella in their composition and story telling tho    kodachrome chemistry  vintage or old  you faggots  i sort of agree here but remember this was state of the art fifty years ago op stated that his scans dont do the slides justice the colours not bad for half a centuary in a box     also remember that in 1966 being a photographer was a thing if the company sent you the staff would comply mostly back then no one knew privacy was a guy with an expensive camera would just turn up and tell people what to do     tldr youre cute
  yet they are 200 times better than what gets posted on /p/ normally
all this amazing composition    i can only get so hard
  i grew up without the internet the internet is overrated it is just another tool for entertainment and propaganda
  not sure if that speaks more about the quality of the slides or the quality of /p/

glad to have witnessed this thread op should do a vivian maier and get this guy in a book or something

this thread has reminded me how important it is that i scan my familys big collection of glass plates from the edwardian period many of them are studies for paintings of edwardian life that my great great grandfather took or hired a photographer take theres also what seems like very early film slides but most of them are stuck together and probably a lost cause    exif data available click here to show/hide  cameraspecific propertiescamera softwareadobe photoshop cc 2018 windowsimagespecific propertiesimage width6719image height5153number of bits per component8 8 8compression schemeuncompressedpixel compositionrgbimage orientationtop lefthandhorizontal resolution1600 dpivertical resolution1600 dpiimage data arrangementchunky formatimage created20181120 152840color space informationuncalibratedimage width1500image height1150

  im so curious to see them
note 8 shutter speed is 10s any way to change it lightroom helps sometimes but i had an axon 7 and the lack of star trail and higher shutter speed on the note 8 was unexpected
  buy a real camera you cant made the shutter speed longer
  ok thanks any camera recommendations
  stack multiple exposures  i used a program that filled in the little gaps in the star trails between exposures
